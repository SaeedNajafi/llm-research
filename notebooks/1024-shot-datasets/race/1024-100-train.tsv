The author wrote the text in order to _ .	Many people say they can not start their day without first having a cup of coffee or tea.People say these drinks help them think clearly and feel more awake.This is because of caffeine,a kind of matter found in some plants.Caffeine helps to give a jumpstart to the nervous system.Now a new report says it may also improve long-term memory. Michael Yassa is a neurobiology professor at the University of California.He and other researchers wanted to know if caffeine could improve what they called memory consolidation.They asked a group of individuals to learn something new,then the same people were given caffeine,the active component in coffee,tea and chocolate. He and the other researchers worked with a group of l60 people who were Caffeinefree.On the first day,all the subjects were shown pictures of everyday objects.They were asked to identify whether the pictures could be found inside the house or outdoors.Some of the subjects were then given a caffeine pill,the others were given a placebo--a pill containing an inactive thing.On the second day,all of the subjects were asked to look at more pictures.Some of the images were exactly like the ones they had seen 24 hours early.But other images were different.And a third group of pictures was similar to the first group but a little different.The participants had to decide whether the images they saw were the same or different from the ones on the first day. Professor Yassa says their answers help to show the effects of caffeine on memory.He says those who took the caffeine pills had a ten to twelve percent increase in their ability to remember the objects.The amount of caffeine the researchers used in the study was similar to one strong cup of coffee. Professor Yassa says pills with a little more caffene also increased memory,but resulted in some participants appearing more nervous.	['report a new research of coffee']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"There was a beautiful garden. Every year the king would go to the garden to decide which flower was the most beautiful one. For the last few years, the rose was always Number One. Because of this, the rose Gulaab became _ It would never let birds stay on its flower. Then all the birds started staying away from Gulaab. Behind Gulaab, there was a little yellow flower. People called it Junglee. Junglee wasn't more beautiful than Gulaab, but it welcomed the birds to stay on its flower. All the birds in the garden liked it. This year the king went to the garden as before. The gardener pointed at the rose and said to the king, "" Your favourite flower, my king."" Of course, the king also saw the yellow flower behind it and asked, ""What flower is that?"" ""Oh! That's Junglee, a wild flower."" "" I didn't see a flower like it before. There are so many birds on it. I think it's much more beautiful than the rose. It will be the King Flower of this year!"" said the king."	['The birds liked to stay on Junglee.']
At first, the writer thought it was _ to ride abike.	"Is bicycling hard to learn? Different people have many different answers. It is strange enough that the same person may also have a different answer as time goes by. Five years ago when I was in Junior Grade One, I got interested in bicycling because I thought my uncle was very cool when he rode his bike. He could ride a bike with only one wheel. He could also sit on the bike and keep it standing straight, without moving for a long time. I thought it was easy to learn to ride a bike, so I decided to learn from my uncle. He told me how to ride. When I fell off the bike the first time, I was afraid to try again. It was too hard for me to learn. Then my uncle helped me by holding the bike for me and not to let go. With his help, I was able to ride longer and longer. ""You can do it by yourself now, young boy!"" I heard his voice far behind me."	['easy']
What's the main idea of this passage?	What Should I Do? One of the most popular items in the school newspaper advice column . No one know who writes it. The students think their teacher does, but it might be a student using a false name. The students enjoy thinking up problems for the advice column. Here are some of them and their answers. ASK THE WISE OWL Q: I'm always late for school. I try not to be, but I can't help it. Please advise me what to do. Tommy. A: You are probably late for school because you don't really like school. My advice to you is try and enjoy school more, then you won't be late so often. Q: I find it difficult to make friends. What do you think I should do? Sara. A: I can't advise you until I know about you. Your problem may be that you are shy. On the other hand, it may be the opposite. You may be too bold . Write and tell me more about yourself. Q: I'm always at the bottom of the class. What do you advise me to do? Molly. A: I advise you to concentrate on improving your grades in one subject to start with. If you can do this, you should move a little way up from the bottom. Next, try to improve your grades in another subject, and so on. If you concentrate on one subject at a time, by the end of the year you should be quite a long way up from the bottom in all your classes. The Wise Owl.

Which of the following statements is NOT true?	"In cities with rent control, the city government sets the maximum rent that a landlord can charge for an apartment. Supporters of rent control argue that it protects people who are living in apartment. Their rent cannot increase; therefore, they are not in danger of losing their homes. However, the critics say that after a long time, rent control may have negative effects. Landlords know that they cannot increase their profits. Therefore, they invest in other businesses where they can increase their profits. They do not invest in new buildings which would also be rent-controlled. As a result, new apartments are not built. Many people who need apartments cannot find any. According to the critics, the end result of rent control is a shortage of apartments in the city. Some experts argue that the minimum wage law can cause problems in the same way. The federal government sets the minimum that an employer must pay workers. The minimum helps people who generally look for unskilled, low-paying jobs. However, if the minimum is high, employers may hire fewer workers. They will replace workers with machinery. Therefore, other things being equal, the number of workers that employers want decreases. Thus, critics hold the opinion that an increase in the minimum wage may cause unemployment. Some poor people may find themselves without jobs instead of with jobs at the minimum wage. Supporters of the minimum wage say that it helps people keep their dignity. Because of the law, workers cannot sell their services for less than the minimum. Furthermore, employers cannot force workers to accept jobs at unfair wages. Economic theory predicts the results of economic decision, such as decisions about farm production, rent control, and the minimum wage. The predictions may be corrected only if ""other things are equal"". Economists do not agree on some of the predictions. They also do not agree on the value of different decisions. Some economists support a particular decision while others criticize it. Economists do agree, however, that there are no simple answers to economic questions."

The best title for the passage would be _ .	"My son wanted to give a party for my birthday. We discussed the invitations and the cost of the party. However, we had very different ideas about whom and how many people to invite. He thought that the people we knew had badly disappointed me by not keeping in touch with me since the death of my wife. But my idea of a relationship among people was to be friendly to everyone. He said, ""Come on, Dad, where have all these so-called friendly, good people been since Mum passed away? They visited us in the past because Mum made good food."" I replied, ""I am sorry to hear that. Is this the reason why you do not want to invite those people? It's no wonder that you are unhappy. Can you live alone? Are you teaching your children to do the same in the future?"" I asked myself where I had gone in his upbringing. My wife had often blamed me for not paying enough attention to communication with other people when I was raising our son. I realized at this moment that she was quite right. Hours later, my son phoned me to say that he accepted his wife's advice and agreed to have a party with some of my friends. In the end, we had a great time. And he didn't ""hate"" those friends any more. ""Happy Birthday, Dad! Sorry that I have kept you away from your friends. I love you."" On hearing what he said, I was full of happiness and excitement. I was proud that he could change his mind."	['My Birthday Party']
What is the best title of the passage?	"Sometimes people give us nicknames in order to be mean or make fun of us, which can really hurt. Four eyes. Metal Mouth. Dumbo, Slow Poke, Crater Face. We've all heard kids calling unpleasant nicknames like these. Maybe you've even used similar nicknames on other kids, or been stuck with one yourself. A playground _ or cut usually disappears after a couple of days, but the pain and anger coming from being called a cruel nickname can last a lot longer than that. If you've ever picked on another kid by making up or using a tease nickname, or of you've ever been on the receiving end of one, you know that names like Fatso, Smelly, and Short Stuff can be very hurtful. Plus, they have a habit of sticking to us like glue! People use negative nicknames as a way of keeping someone out of a group of gaining power over someone, or of making themselves feel more important. You may know a kid in your class who always comes up with nicknames for the other kids. This student likes to feel cool by acting like the official ""nicknamer."" This can give a student a feeling of power, but that power comes at the cost of making other kids feel bad. Kids who give others hurtful nicknames are often trying to cover up the fact that they really feel bad about themselves. Like other kinds of insults , a cruel nickname can be used to make a kid feel being left out or angry. Sometimes they're even nastier than most ways of being mean, because they can be so hard to shake off."	['Hurtful nicknames']
Which of the following is TRUEaccording to the passage?	"A recent survey by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) found that about a third of nurses inprefix = st1 /UKplanned to give up their jobs in the next two years because of the amount of worries and unhappiness with their pay. Among those under 40, the percentage of nurses planning to leave their employers increased from 32% in 2005 to 36% in 2007. The survey also found that 71% of nurses believed they could be paid more for less effort if they left nursing, compared to 60% in 1997. The research was published as the RCN hosted a meeting for nurse leaders to deal with the growing concerns of the nurses. Josie Irwin, an RCN expert, said, "" Many nurses say that changes in junior doctors' hours have resulted in an increase in their workload. Nurses are under more and more pressure."" Ms Irwin added, ""Only 22% of all nurses disagree that they are under too much pressure."" She also said that 27% of nurses had a second job, with the main reason that they needed some extra income. ""Nurses have made it clear that while they enjoy their work, they have more to do than ever and are not being paid enough to do it."" She added. "" For this reason, the RCN is calling for a pay increase for nurses to bring their pay into line with others."" The survey of 4,795 nurses found that some important changes to the profession had taken place in recent years. The average age of the nurses questioned was 42 ---compared to an average of 33 in 1987. The RCN said that the age increase was because people were now becoming nurses later. In the 1960s, the average age of a nurse on the completion of training was 21, but over the last 5 years it has been an average of 29."	['Nurses in UKtend to be older in age than before.']
It can be learned from the passage that _ .	Puerto Rico may be part of the USA but its music and dance is a mixture of both Spanish and American rhythms . The country, as a result, is a mixture of the new and the old. It exhibits the open American way of life yet remains the more formal Spanish influences . This is showed in the buildings, not just the difference between the old and the modern in urban areas but also in the countryside, where older buildings sit side by side with schools and houses. It is found in the cooking, too many fast food restaurants together with local cooking which has its roots in the mixture of culture of all the Caribbean and in the music --- rock music is played in beach holiday centers but in the hilly center, Puerto Rican music can be heard. Old volcanic mountains, long motionless, take up a large part of the center, with the highest peak, Cerro de Punta, at 1,338 metre in the Cordillera Central. The mountains are surrounded by a coastal plain with the Atlantic shore beaches cooled all the year round by trade winds. The population is 3.8 million, of which about 1.5 million live in San Juan, although about another two million Puerto Ricans live in the prefix = st1 /USA. The average life is 73.8 years and GDP per person is US$12, 212, the highest in Latin America, although not up to the level of mainlandUSA. The people are largely a mixture of Amerindian, Taino-Arawak, Spanish and African. Most Puerto Ricans do not speak English and less than 30% speak it well. The people are very friendly and _ but there is law-breaking action, linked to drugs and unemployment.	['Puerto Rico belongs to the USA']
The passage gives the following tips EXCEPT that _ .	"We may have hosted some difficult house guests once or on even more occasions. Are you still worrying about how to deal with them? Here below are some tips on how to deal with those difficult house guests. You've been waiting an hour to eat breakfast but your guests are still sleeping. ""Unless you adjusted a time for breakfast the evening before, let your guests sleep-in and enjoy your breakfast without them. If possible, keep their breakfast warm. Or better yet, when entertaining it's always a good idea to have cold breakfast (as well as lunch, dinner and snack) food on-hand."" ----Pamela Eyring,president and director of The Protocol School of Washington Your guest's teenage son is a Facebook addict and hogs your computer all day long. ""If you have a guest whose fingers are fixated to your keyboard, kindly let him know that you are expecting work email and give him enough time to finish using it."" ----Ummu Bradley Thomas, founder of the Freddie Bell Jones Modeling and Finishing School, Inc.

The functions of allowances given to children are the following EXCEPT _ .	Many children first learn the value of money by receiving an allowance. Parents often give their children an amount of money that they may spend as they wish. The purpose is to let the children learn from experience at an early age when financial mistakes are not very costly. A child may receive an allowance each week or each month. The amount is not so important. But parents should make clear what the child is expected to pay for with the money. At first, young children may spend all of their allowance soon after they receive it. If they do this, they will learn the hard way that spending must be done within a budget. Parents should not offer more money until the next allowance is to be given. Older children may be responsible enough to budget larger costs like those for clothing. The object is to show young people that a budget demands choices between spending and saving. Many people who have written on the subject say it is not a good idea to pay your child for work around the home. These jobs are a normal part of family life. Paying children to do extra work around the home, however, can be useful. It can even provide an understanding of how a business works. Allowances give children a chance to experience three things they can do with money. They can share it in the form of gifts or giving it to organizations. They can spend it by buying things they want. Or they can save it. Saving helps children understand that costly goals require _ : you have to cut costs and plan for the future. Requiring children to save part of their allowance can also open the door to future saving and investing. Many banks offer free savings accounts for young people with small amounts of money.

What could be the best title for the text?	"It is a familiar scene these days: employees taking newly laid-off co-workers out for a drink for comfort. But which side deserves sympathy more, the jobless or the still employed? On March 6, researchers at a conference at the University of Cambridge heard data suggesting it's the latter. Brendan Burchell, a Cambridge sociologist, presented his analysis based on various surveys conducted across Europe. The data suggest that employed people who feel insecure in their jobs show similar levels of anxiety and depression as those who are unemployed. Although a newly jobless person's mental health may""bottom out"" after about six months, and then even begin to improve, the mental state of people who are continuously worried about losing their job ""just continues to get worse and worse"", Burchell says. Evolutionary psychologists support this theory by arguing that human beings feel more stress during times of insecurity because they sense an immediate but invisible threat. Patients have been known to experience higher levels of anxiety,for example, while waiting for examination results than knowing what they are suffering from-even if the result is cancer. It's better to get the bad news and start doing something about it rather than wait with anxiety. When the uncertainty continues, people stay in a nonstop ""fight or flight"" response, which leads to damaging stress. But not every employee in insecure industries has such a discouraging view,Burchell says. In general, women get on better. While reporting higher levels of anxiety than men when directly questioned, women scored lower in stress on the GHQ 12, even when they had a job they felt insecure about losing. As Burchell explains, ""For women, most studies show that any job-it doesn't matter whether it is secure or insecure-gives psychological improvement over unemployment. "" Burchell supposes that the difference in men is that they tend to feel pressure not only to be employed, but also to be the primary breadwinner, and that more of a man's self-worth depends on his job."

According to James Holland,we know that _ .	"No more batteries,no more chargers and no more wires.This is the future promised by ""wireless power"".a means of broadcasting electricity through the air to laptops,iPods and other gadgets without the need for cables and sockets . Wireless lighting,audio speakers and digital picture frames are expected to be among the first commercial products exhibited in Las Vegas this week at the International Consumer Electronics Show,the world's biggest gadgets tradeshow. Experts believe this is just the beginning and that eventually wireless electricity could do for battery life what WiFi did for,the Internet.In a world without wires,laptop users in cafes and airport terminals would be inside an ""electricity hotspot"" and no longer have to delve an awkwardly located socket. ""You'd be able to buy.a desk that charged any gadget placed on it, or power any PC you put on top,"" said James Holland,editor of gadgets website Eleetricpig.co.uk.""If each room had wireless power,you'd know that once you walked through the front door your nmbile would start charging up--even while still in your bag or pocket.You'd never need to hunt for the right charger again."" Among the companies showcasing the ambitions technology at CES is Power Beam.Its system turns electricity into an invisible laser, then beams it as heat,across the room to a solar cell that conveys it back into dectricity. David Graham,the co-founder of Power Beam,said:""We're going to delete the word 'recharge' from the English dictionary.If your,cell phone is recharging on your desk.all day,you won't be thinking about.it."" The Silicon Valley company can currently use a laser to generate about 1.5 watts of power to _ a solar.cell 10 meters away.This, sould be enough to power an electronic speaker or small LED lights,but not enough to operate a laptop,which requires about 30 to 50 watts.However,Graham said that the technology could comfortably be scaled up . Power Beam insists its laser does not lead to a risk to users' health because it is simply moving heat from one place to another.Graham said that,if someone walked through the beam,it would shut down within a thousandth of a second,then restart once the path is clear.The technology also promises because it would only power products when needed."

The new research comes to the conclusion that high self-esteem _ .	"Everyone has good days and bad days. Sometimes, you feel as if you're on top of the world. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork. For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something. ""Forget about self-esteem,"" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, US. ""It's not the important thing."" Feeling good Crocker's advice may sound a bit strange because it is good to feel good about yourself. Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem. But, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person. He believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said: ""There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school."" Problems All types of people have problems. People with high self-esteem can have big egos that can make them less likeable to their peers , said Kathleen Vohs, a psychology professor at Columbia University. People with high self-esteem tend to think more of themselves, Vohs says. People with low self-esteem are more likely to rely on their friends when they need help. What to do Researchers say it is best to listen to and support other people. Find positive ways to contribute to society. If you fail at something try to learn from the experience. ""The best therapy is to recognize your faults,"" Vohs says. ""It's OK to say, 'I'm not so good at that,' and then move on."""	['may not be the key to success']
In Arabic countries you must be careful with your _ .	We know good manners are important. Today I am going to tell you something about manners in different countries. I think you already know that people in different countries usually have different ways of doing things. Something that is rude in one country may be quite polite in another. For example, in Britain you mustn't lift your bowl to your mouth when you are having liquid food. That is considered bad manners in Britain. But in Japan you needn't worry about making a noise when you drink something. It shows that you are enjoying it. In Britain we try not to put our hands on the table at all during a meal. In Mexico, however, guests are expected to keep their hands on the table _ a meal. In Arabic countries we must be careful with our hands. You see, in Arabic countries you mustn't eat with your left hand. This is considered to be very impolite. So, what should you do if you visit a foreign country? Well, you needn't worry. You can ask the native people there to help you and you can just watch carefully and try to do what they do.	['hands']
Shenzhou X, China's fifth manned spacecraft was sent into space _ .	June 11,2013 was another big day for Chinese space exploration. Shenzhou X, China's fifth manned spacecraft, was sent into space. Three astronauts, Nie Haisheng, 49, Zhang Xiaoguang, 47, and Wang Yaping, 33, stayed in space for 15 days. Tiangong-1 is China's first space module . It was sent into space in 2011. It will be developed into a large space station around 2020. A space station is a lab for scientific studies.Shenzhou X performed its first docking with Tangong-1 on June 13. It docked twice during the 15 days. The US, Russia, Japan, Canada and Europe are working together on the International Space Station (ISS).China wanted to join the ISS but was refused by the US. China decided to build its own space station. Shenzhou X flew around the Tianggong-1 lab for the first time. This was to make sure that spacecraft could dock from more than just one direction. The astronauts carried out repair work and did experiments on the Tiangong-1. Teaching from space Wang Yaping, China's second woman astronaut, taught high school and primary school students about space science. Wang talked about how things move in a micro-gravity environment. This helped the students better understand some physics ideas, like Newton's Law. The lessons aimed to encourage more students to learn about the universe and science. Life up in space The three astronauts followed a work and rest schedule that is similar on the Earth. They had Chinese dishes, such as Kung Pao Chicken and fried rice. The food was kept in special bags. At the time of the Dragon Boat Festival, they had Zongzi.	['on June 11, 2013']

Which of the following can best describe the children's feelings while making their first bread?	"""Mom, can I bake some bread?"" We were 15, my best friend, Hanna, and I, determined to try our hands at creating some beautiful bread. ""It's not worth the trouble,"" my mother said. ""It takes lots of time and makes a big mess. Our bakery bread is delicious without all that effort."" Begging was useless. Mom's ""no"" meant ""No!"" But several weeks later, opportunity knocked: My parents were going out for the evening. I immediately invited Hanna to be my partner in bread-baking crime. We studied the recipe. That was easy. ""Mix oil into flour then beat in four of the eggs, one at a time, with remaining sugar and salt."" We were not good at breaking eggs. I tried to learn from my mother. ""Gradually add eight cups of flour. When dough holds together, squeeze it."" We took turns working like that. ""Is the dough 'holding together'?"" we asked each other. I remembered my neighbor's instructions: ""If it's too sticky, add some flour; if too dry, add water."" We added water. Then more flour. Then more water. By then, the mass of our dough had grown very much. ""Place dough on floured surface and squeeze till smooth,"" the recipe instructed. We took turns burying our hands in the damp dough, pinching, squeezing, and feeling it leak between fingers. ""Clean and oil bowl, then return dough to bowl. Cover and let dough rise in warm place for 1 hour."" This was good news --- we'd have a break. On dirtied kitchen chairs, we dreamed about our beautiful bread. ""See?"" we would tell my mom. ""Isn't it worth the work?"" Hanna and I couldn't help glancing at the rising process every few minutes. But nothing was happening. ""Maybe something will happen in the hot oven,"" I said. Unfortunately, when we removed the loaves from the oven, they were like hard stones. Mom was right; it takes time and effort. It sometimes makes a mess. But still it feels good, somehow, to be part of that long, ongoing chain of bread bakers. Since that night, both Hanna and I have learned to do it right."	['Curious; hopeful; disappointed.']
The author's attitude toward the Peales is in general_.	The Peales were a famous family of American artists.Charles Willson Peale is best remembered for his portraits of leading figures of the American Revolution.He painted portraits of Franklin and Jefferson and over a dozen of George Washington.His life-size portrait of his sons Raphaelle and Titian was so realistic that George Washington reportedly once tipped his hat to the figures in the picture. Charles Willson Peale gave up painting in his middle age and devoted his life to the Peale seum,which he founded in Philadelphia.The world's first popular museum of art and natural science mainly covered paintings by Peale and his family as well as displays of animals in their natural settings Peale found the animals himself and found a method to make the exhibits more lifelike.The museum's most popular display was the skeleton of a huge,extinct elephant,which Peale unearthed on a New York farm in l801. Three of Peale's seventeen children were also famous artists.Raphaelle Peale often painted still lives of flowers,fruit,and cheese.His brother Rembrandt studied under his father and painted portraits of many noted people,including one of George Washington.

The best title of this passage is _ .	All students should have good study habits. When you have good study habits, you can learn things quickly. You also remember them easily . Do you like to study in the living-room? This is not a good place because it is usually too noisy. You should study in a quiet place, like your bedroom. A quiet place will help you only think about one thing, and you will learn better. Before you begin to study, do not forget to clean your desk. A good desk light is important, too .You'll feel tired easily if there is not much light .	['Good Study Habits']
It can be inferred from the passage that Yocum and Bell _ .	"Most young architects--particularly those in big cities--can only dream about working in a building of their own. And making that dream come true often means finding a building no one else seems to want, which is exactly what happened to David Yocum and his partner, Brain Bell. Their building is a former automobile electrical--parts firm in Atlanta. From the outside, it looks too old, even something horrible, but open the door and you are in a wide, open courtyard, lined on three sides with rusting walls. In 2000, Yocum and Bell found this building in the city's West End. Built in 1947, the structure had been abandoned years earlier and the roof of the main building had fallen down. But the price was right, so Yocum bought it. He spent eight months of his off-hours on demolition , pulling rubbish out through the roof, because it was too dangerous to go inside the building, The demolition was hard work, but it gave him time to think about what he wanted to do, and ""to treasure what was there--the walls, the rust, the light,"" Yocum said. ""Every season, more paint falls off the walls and more rust develops. It's like an art installation in there--a slow-motion show."" Since the back building had been constructed without windows, an all-glass front was added to the building to give it a view of the courtyard, and skylights were installed in the roof. The back of the building is a working area and a living room for Yocum and his wife. A sort of buffer zone between the front and the back contains a bathroom, a kitchen and a mechanical room, and the walls that separate these zones have openings that allow views through to the front of the studio and the courtyard beyond. Yocum and Bell, who have just completed an art gallery for the city, feel that the experience from the decoration of their building, focusing on the inside rather than the outside, has influenced their work. It has also given these architects a chance to show how they can make more out of less."	['got inspiration from decorating their old building']
A school ranking list tells you _ .	Living abroad to study can certainly be an interesting experience but is that alone a good enough reason for spending years far away from home? To make the experience truly worthwhile, there has to be a goal behind the decision to study abroad. This may be a wish to perfect language skills in a foreign language environment, or a clever move in your career development. You must also consider the costs, not just of living and studying abroad, but of applying. Most universities now charge application fees for international students. If after considering these points you are sure that you want to apply to study abroad, your next step is to choose the right programme of studies. Research your choices and select carefully. You must do your homework well. Most universities have information online but you can also email and ask them to send you more details. You can find a lot of information on school ranking from education websites. But read carefully. Different universities emphasize different strengths. Don't just think about the university's reputation ; look for the most suitable for your goals. Next, you must deal with a large pile of paperwork. This involves filling in application form, preparing your school records, and getting reference letters. Reading the instructions and requirements of the universities carefully is of great importance. Sadly, many fine applicants get kicked out in the first round, simply because they don't follow the application procedure properly. Money is another important consideration. Some scholarships are provided by governments, others by schools and colleges. This information, again, can be found on the Internet. If you find a scholarship that is suitable for you, follow the application procedure carefully; the earlier you apply, the better your chance of getting it.

Your long-term memory includes _ .	"""Memorize these words."" ""Learn this spelling rule."" ""Don't forget about the exam tomorrow."" You remember things every day, but how do you do it? When you want to call a store or an office that you don't call often, you look in the telephone book for the number. You _ the number, and then you forget it! You use your short-term memory to remember the number. Your short-term memory lasts about half a minute. However, you don't need to look in the telephone book for your best friend's number because you already know it. This information is in your long-term memory. Your long-term memory has everything that you remember through the years. The major reason for forgetting something is because you do not learn it well at the beginning. For example, you meet some new people, and right away you forget their names. You hear the names but you do not learn them, so you forget them."	['almost everything that you remember through the years']
From the passage we can learn that_.	"There were times when it was only schoolchildren who felt sick before they got their grades.But now teachers in prefix = st1 /Germanyare scared, too, as they are being graded by their students. Many teachers are opposed to it.They don't mind being evaluated.But they are upset because the results are then being posted on the Internet and accessible to millions of Internet users.On the website www.spickmich.deduring the past four months students have posted evaluations of 100,000 teachers. The teachers are graded on categories such as ""motivated"", ""good instruction,"" ""easy examinations"", or even ""sexy."" Many teachers think that their privacy has been violated. The creators of the website say that the students are only being offered the chance to provide teachers with some feedback about their classroom instruction.Bernd Dicks, who founded the website with three friends, says that the students are largely quite satisfied with their teachers.On a grading scale of one to six, the teachers' average grade is 2.7 and it has been improving lately.He often says the impression is that students are bullying their teachers.But there is also bullying of the students by teachers. ""Teachers must also learn to live with criticism,"" he added.But still, the website is not totally immune from manipulation , as one teacher near the northern city of Hanover recently proved.He registered himself on the website as a student and then rated his own teaching colleagues highly.Within a few days, seven of his colleagues were listed in the top 10 rankings of Germany's best teachers."

Before the experiment took place the psychiatrists _ .	"A few years ago, in one experiment in behavioural psychology, Stanley Milgram of Yale University tested 40 subjects for their willingness to obey instructions given by a ""leader"" in a situation in which the subjects might feel a personal dislike of the actions they were called upon to perform. Specifically, Milgram told each volunteer ""teacher-subject"" that the experiment was in the noble cause of education, and was designed to test whether or not punishing pupils for their mistakes would have a positive effect on the pupils' ability to learn. The teacher-subjects were placed before a panel of thirty switches with labels ranging from ""15 volts of electricity (slight shock)"" to ""450 volts (danger -- severe shock)"" in steps of 15 volts each. The teacher-subject was told that whenever the pupil gave the wrong answer to a question, a shock was to be administered. The supposed ""pupil"" was in reality an actor hired by Milgram to pretend to receive the shocks by giving out cries and screams. Milgram told the teacher-subject to ignore the reactions of the pupil, and to administer whatever level of shock was called for. As the experiment unfolded, the ""pupil"" would deliberately give the wrong answers to questions, thereby bringing on various electrical punishments, even up to the danger level of 300 volts and beyond. Many of the teacher-subjects _ administering the higher levels of punishment, and turned to Milgram. In these situations, Milgram calmly explained that the teacher-subject was to carry on with the experiment and that it was important for the sake of the experiment that the procedure be followed through to the end. What Milgram was trying to discover was the number of teacher-subjects who would be willing to administer the highest levels of shock, even in the face of strong personal and moral revulsion against the rules and conditions of the experiment. Before carrying out the experiment, Milgram explained his idea to a group of 39 psychiatrists and asked them to predict the average percentage of people who would be willing to administer the highest shock level of 450 volts. The overwhelming consensus was that basically all the teacher-subjects would refuse to obey the experimenter. The psychiatrists felt that ""most subjects would not go beyond 150 volts"" and only a small percentage of about one in 1,000 would give the highest shock of 450 volts. What were the actual results? Well, over 60 per cent of the teacher-subjects continued to obey Milgram up to the 450-volt limit! In repetitions of the experiment in other countries, the percentage was even higher, reaching 85 per cent in one country. How can we possibly account for this result? One might firstly argue that there must be some sort of built-in animal aggression instinct that was activated by the experiment. A modem sociobiologist might even go so far as to claim that this aggressive instinct was of survival value to our ancestors in their struggle against the hardships of life on the plains and in the caves, finally finding its way into our genetic make-up. Another explanation is to see the teacher-subjects' actions as a result of the social context in which the experiment was carried out. As Milgram himself pointed out, ""Most subjects in the experiment see their behaviour in a larger context that is good and useful to society -- the pursuit of scientific troth. The psychological laboratory has a strong claim to legitimacy and gains trust and confidence in those who perform there. An action such as shocking a victim, which in isolation appears evil, acquires a completely different meaning when placed in this setting"". Here we have two different explanations. The problem for us is to sort out which of these two polar explanations is more reasonable. This is the problem of modern sociobiology -- to discover how hard-wired genetic programming decides the interaction of animals and humans with their environment, that is, their behaviour. Put another way, sociobiology is concerned with explaining the biological basis of all behaviour."	"[""under-predicted the teacher-subjects' willingness to follow experimental procedure""]"

"The explorers in H. G. Well's story were surprised to find that the ""moon people"" _ ."	"People have always been dreaming of going to the moon. As long as the year 1901, H. G. Wells, an English writer, wrote a book vividly describing a trip to the moon. On landing there, the explorers discovered that the moon was full of underground cities. Words failed to express their surprise when they spotted so many ""moon people"". The ""moon people"" felt even more surprised. ""Why,"" they asked, ""are you traveling to outer space when you don't even use your inner space?"" H. G. Wells could only imagine a travel to the moon. In 1969, human beings really left their footsteps on the moon. People today know that there are no underground cities on the moon. However, the question that the ""moon people"" asked is still an interesting one. A growing number of scientists are seriously thinking about _ . Underground systems are already in place. Many cities have underground car parks. In some cities, such as Tokyo, Seoul and Montreal, there are large underground shopping areas. The ""Channel"", a tunnel connecting England and France, is now complete. But what about underground cities? Japan's Taisei Corporation is designing a network of underground systems, called ""Alice Cities"". The designers imagine using surface space for public parks and using underground space for flats, offices, shopping, and so on. A solar dome would cover the whole city. Supporters of underground development argue that building down rather than building up is a good way to use the earth's space. The space, they say, can be used for farms, parks, gardens, and wilderness. H. G. Wells' ""moon people"" would second it. Would you?"	['lived in underground cities']
The purpose of the writer's asking for his pay back is _ .	I got your letter and was glad to find that you had not forgotten Jourdon, and that you wanted me to come back and live with you again in Tennessee, promising to do better for me than anybody else can. Although you shot at me twice before I left you, I did not want to hear of your being hurt. It would do me good to go back to the dear old home again and see Allen, Esther, Green, and Lee. Give my love to them all, and tell them I hope we will meet in the better world, if not in this. I want to know particularly what the good chance is you propose to give me. I am doing tolerably well here in Ohio. I get twenty-five dollars a month, with food and clothing; have a comfortable home for Mandy, the folks call her Mrs. Anderson; and the children--Milly, Jane, and Grundy--go to school and are learning well. The teacher says Grundy has a head for a preacher. We are kindly treated. Now, if you will write and say what wages you will give me, I will be better able to decide whether it would be to my advantage to move back again. We have concluded to test your sincerity by asking you to send us our wages for the time we served you. This will make us forget and forgive old scores and rely on your justice and friendship in the future. I served you faithfully for thirty-two years, and Mandy twenty years. At twenty-five dollars a month for me, and two dollars a week for Mandy, our earnings would amount to eleven thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. Add to this the interest for the time our wages have been kept back, and deduct what you paid for our clothing, and three doctor's visits to me, and pulling a tooth for Mandy. If you fail to pay us for faithful labors in the past, we can have little faith in your promises in the future. In answering this letter, please state if there would be any safety for my Milly and Jane, who are now grown up, and both good-looking girls. I would rather stay here and starve--and die, if it should come to that--than have my girls brought to shame by the violence and wickedness of their young Masters. You will also please state if there has been any schools opened for the colored children in your neighborhood. The great desire of my life now is to give my children an education and have them form virtuous habits. Say howdy to George Carter, and thank him for taking the pistol from you when you were shooting at me.	['to test whether the letter receiver is worthy of trust']
From Thomas Hood's poem,we may infer that _ .	"Autumn means different things to different people. ""It all depends on your personality,"" said British naturalist Richard Mabey. ""Personality shapes your view of the season,"" he said. ""You may see it as a fading-away,a packing-up ,or as a time of packing in another sense--the exciting gathering of resources before a long journey."" If this is true,perhaps it tells us a little about,for instance,Thomas Hood,the 19th Century English poet. About November,he wrote: No warmth,no cheerfulness,no healthful ease No shade,no shine,no butterflies,no bees November! On the other hand,another English poet John Keats,already sensing he was seriously ill,was inspired by a late September day to pen one of the most famous poems in the English language,To Autumn. He wrote to a friend afterwards that there was something comforting and healing about it. According to Richard Mabey,Keats has the biological evidence on his side. Autumn is not a time of slowing down,but a time of new beginnings and great movements of creatures. For example,just at the moment that Keats's ""gathering swallows"" ( in To Autumn)are departing for Africa,millions of creatures are fleeing from the frozen north like Iceland,Greenland and Russia to winter along the east and south coasts of Britain. According to scientists,before falling,the leaves transfer their chlorophyll and carbohydrates into the woody parts of the tree for safe keeping over winter. What remains is the natural antioxidants in the leaves: the yellow and orange carotenoids ,and another protective chemical specially produced for autumn,the bright-red anthocyanin .High colour is not a signal of deterioration and decline,but of detox ability and good health. A century after Keats,the American poet Loren Eiseley wrote in his journal: ""Suppose we saw ourselves burning-like maples in a golden autumn. And that we could break up like autumn leaves...dropping their substance like chlorophyll. Wouldn't our attitude towards death be different?"""	['he had a negative attitude towards autumn']
Which statement is NOT true?	"The day began with clear sunlight and blue skies.It soon turned into years of war, economic breakdown and political division. Ten years after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11,2001, America has come out of the smoke a very different country.Nearly 3,000 people died on September 11. Suddenly America had to wake up to the fact that not everyone loves the USS A.Members of al-Qaeda, the militant group that earned out the attacks, were angry about US support for the Israelis against Palestinians in the Middle East, about US troops in Saudi Arabia, and about sanctions against Iraq. ""September 11 and the years that followed were a shock to our national consciousness,"" said Nicholas Bums, American ambassador to NATO at the time.The terrorists struck not only the buildings, but also Americans- faith in their power.The fear that America had lost control of events as widespread. In the name of fighting terrorism, the US launched wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.More than 6,000 Americans have died.Tens of thousands of ordinary people in those countries have also lost their lives. But deaths are only part of the story.The world was shocked by photographs of Americans torturing Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.David Goldstein, a reporter with The Kansas City Star, questioned American behavior: ""Has torturing so-called terrorists saved American lives or made the values we advocate around the world weaker? ..."" Is that what we've become?"" However, a brief moment of national unity did occur straight after 9/11.""Americans were coming together in an unusually powerful way ...in the ashes.We live in a bittersweet memory of that collective tragedy and collective possibility,"" said filmmaker Ken Burns. September 11 was that kind of common moment.When it was over, the Harth still turned in its usual way and the stars in the sky shone as before.But the universe had shifted somehow. Though the world felt the consequence of September 11, more is to come.Ten years on, it still might be too soon to tell."	['More than 6000 Americans have died since the 9/11 attacks.']
Which of the following is NOT true?	"An Australian inventor has designed and built an environmentally friendly ferry that uses solar and wind power to transport people around Sydney Harbor. Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor were given the top prize at the Australian Design Awards recently. The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four sources of energy for its power -- solar, wind, battery power with stored solar energy and a fuel generator in store all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots on just wind and solar power. It's solar wings and fiberglass solar panels which not only take in sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails. ""We angle our solar panels to the sun in two planes , which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,"" Dane says. ""And also we can use that same structure to do another job, which is also the sail, and so these wing sails actually push the ferry forward just like a soft sail does."" Computers check the sun and wind and angle the solar wings to take in the most sunlight. If there isn't much wind or it is a cloudy day, energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. ""If the batteries are too low, then the computer turns the generator on so the boat is always able to meet a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B no matter what,"" Dan explains. Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book on insects. He was amazed how insects use their wings to collect solar energy to warm themselves. ""When I read that, I realized there was a good example in nature for what we were going to do, which was to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to sail,"" he says."	['If the batteries are too low, the ferry travels a little more slowly.']
Why were Cecilia and her family able to survive the earthquake?	"""Ceci, wake up. It's an earthquake!"" That's what Cecilia Wallace heard her mother shouting on the early morning of February 27th. Cecilia is a 7th-grader. She, her parents and her brother, Sam, were in Chile's capital city, Santiago, the day a big earthquake hit Chile. And like just about everyone else, they were shaken out of their sleep. ""It was so frightening,"" Sam wrote. ""The shaking was so huge that I will never go on a ride again."" Cecilia and Sam wrote about their earthquake experiences. Their reports were later posted on the website. Cecilia, Sam and their parents were staying in an apartment on the 15th floor of a building. They were lucky. Their building stayed standing, because it was built to withstand earthquakes. Not everyone was as lucky as the Wallace family. More than 800 people died. Many older buildings fell down during the earthquake. The damage in Santiago wasn't as bad as in other parts of Chile. So the supermarkets were open for business on the morning of the quake. But it wasn't business as usual. ""The supermarkets have been crazy with people rushing to buy their food for the next while,"" Sam wrote. Not everyone was able to get money to buy food that morning. So Cecilia and Sam made food bags to _ to people who were begging outside the supermarket. ""We gave some to a kid of my age. I made sure he got cookies and bread."" Sam and Cecilia's mother wrote that the kids also collected money for the Red Cross. It's certainly an experience Cecilia, Sam and their parents will never forget. Thankfully, they lived to tell their stories."	['Because the building they were living in was strong enough.']

The best day I have ever had was when I finished first in the 800-metre race at my secondary school. It was a school record, although I didn't know that at the time. My family makes me happy, too. Antonio My little sister makes me sad because she always tells tales on me to my mum. If I am having a bad day, food cheers me up. I like chili con carne and sweet chili crisps. It makes me happy because I want to be big and have lots of energy. Usman I haven't done anything very exciting in my life but one of my best achievements is that I got a good report from my school this year, because last year I got a bad one. People on TV make me laugh, particularly Eddie Murphy. If I am having a bad day I watch Basil Brush. I am good at making other people happy. I just talk and my friends start laughing -- they think I am silly. Ashleigh If I'm having a bad day, knowing that someone is there for me can make me happy.

Which of the following about the author's father is true?	I believe in leaving work at five o'clock. In a nation with such a strict work ethic , this is considered strange. Working only 40 hours a week? I just don't know many people who punch out at five o'clock anymore. My father tried to teach me the importance of hard work, long hours and devotion to a career. But then there are the things he taught me unintentionally, like when he arrived home from work for the last time and crawled up the stairs. My father, a self-employed sales trainer, was that sick, that tired. His body was wracked with liver cancer, and he suffered the effects of a diabetic ulcer . Despite all this, he insisted on traveling a long way to give a lecture. He probably earned a lot of money that day, but he paid the price. He returned to the hospital soon afterwards and was dead within three months, aged just 58. It's been 10 years since I saw my father come home that night and since then, I've thought a lot about work. I've decided something: I will never crawl up the stairs exhausted. As much as I love my job as a newspaper reporter, I will never work myself into the ground, physically or emotionally. _ After all, I am my father's daughter. In college, I was the girl who sat on the library steps each morning, waiting for the doors to open. I even dreamt about schoolwork. My dad once told me he was unable to just gaze at a sunset; he had to be doing something as he looked at it--writing, reading, playing chess. You could say he was a success: He was a published author, an accomplished musician, fluent in many languages. That's an impressive list, but the thing is I want to gaze at sunsets. I don't want to meet a deadline during them or be writing a column at the same time, or glance at them over the top of a book. This raises the question: If I leave work at five o' clock to watch the sunset, what are the consequences? Do I risk not reaching the top of my profession? Maybe, because honestly, knocking off after eight hours probably won't earn me the best promotion. But hey, leaving work at five o' clock means I eat dinner with my family. I get to hop on my bike and cycle through the streets of my hometown when there is no traffic. And I get to take in a lot of sunsets. That's got to be worth something.

This was a lesson about _ .	"One day, a teacher was giving a speech to his students. He held up a glass of water and asked the class, ""How heavy do you think this glass of water is?"" The students' answers ranged from 20 g to 500 g. ""It does not matter on the weight itself. It depends on how long you hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it is OK. If I hold it for an hour, I will have an ache in my right arm. If I hold it for a day, you will have to call an ambulance . It is exactly the same weight, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes. "" If we carry our burdens all the time, sooner or later, we will not be able to carry on, the burden becoming increasingly heavier. "" ""What you have to do is to put the glass down, rest for a while before holding it up again. "" We have to put down the burden sometimes, so that we can be refreshed and are able to carry on. So before you return home from work tonight, put the burden of work down. Don't carry it back home. You can pick it up tomorrow. Whatever burdens you are having now on your shoulders, let it down for a moment if you can."	['how to relax oneself in life']

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	Testing has taken the place of teaching in most public schools. Pretests, drills, tests, and retests. They know that the best way to read a textbook is to look at the questions at the end of the chapter and then read the text quickly for the answers. I believe that my daughter Erica, who gets excellent marks, has never read a chapter of any of her school textbooks all the way through. And teachers are often heard to say proudly and openly that they teach to the test. Teaching to the test is a curious phenomenon . Instead of deciding what skills students ought to learn, helping students learn them, and then using some methods of assessment to discover whether students have mastered the skills, teachers are encouraged to teach the students in the opposite way. First one looks at a test. Then one chooses the skills needed not to master reading, but to do well in the test. Finally, the test skills are taught. The ability to read or write might suggest the ability to do reasonably well on standardized tests. However, neither reading nor writing develops simply through being taught to take tests. We must be careful to avoid mistaking preparations for a test of a skill with the acquisition of that skill. Too many discussions of basic skills make this misunderstanding because people are tested rather than concerned with the nature and quality of what is taught. Recently, many schools have faced what could be called the crisis of comprehension or, in simple words, the phenomenon of students with grammar skills still being unable to understand what they read. These students are quite good at test taking and filling in workbooks. However, they have little or no experience reading or thinking, and talking about what they read. They know the details but can't see or understand the whole. They are taught to be so concerned with grades that they have no time to think about meaning, and reread things if necessary.	['Preparations for a test of a skill do not mean the acquisition of that skill.']
At the beginning, Ocean Park Hong Kong _ .	"Ocean Park Hong Kong is a theme park in the Southern District of Hong Kong Island. The park was built with donations from the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club (now Hong Kong Jockey Club) and opened on 10 January 1977. Today it offers affordable marine animal education and entertainment and is a private organization for commercial purpose. In the early operation of the park, the main sources of income for the park were the ticket prices and the funding from the Jockey Club. Since the ticket price was low, most of the time Ocean Park was operating under deficit . In July 1987, the government established a 200 million trust from the funding of Jockey Club, under the Ocean Park Corporation Ordinance. This separated Ocean Park from Jockey Club and became a non-profit organization; it needs to be responsible for its own income and was allowed to use commercial means to operate the park. Since it was permitted to use commercial means to operate, it gradually raised its ticket price and the deficit turned into profit. In 1992, 3 million visitors visited the park. Since 1998, the East Asian financial crisis , aging attractions, and the passing away of the killer whale, the park recorded a deficit for a couple years. Although it was allowed to host 2 pandas in 1999, the number of visitors did not go up and Ocean Park was forced to close its water attractions and the ""Old Village"" attraction and turned to bring in more rides in an attempt to capture the youth demand. Together with the opening up of mainland visitors under the Individual Visit Scheme, Ocean Park recorded an astonishing 4 million visitors in the year 2004-2005, the highest since the park opened. In March 2005, Ocean Park made its redevelopment plan. On 23 November 2006, Ocean Park held a groundbreaking ceremony for its redevelopment."

What's a problem for the career people from this passage?	"One of the problems career people have in the morning is dressing for the office when there will be an evening party immediately followed, with no time to return home to change. The easiest solution is to keep a full set of toiletries and make-ups stored somewhere at the office. A woman going to an evening party should dress in one of her ""basic dresses"" in the morning--the kind that can change into a different look with an added scarf or jewelry. In fifteen minutes, when her office day has ended, she can metamorphose herself into another person with freshly cleaned teeth, combed hair, a new face, a different and dressier pair of shoes, and some sparkling jewelry. If she must wear a long dress for the party, she should bring it to the office in a protective bag and store it safely until she has to put it on."	['They often have no time to change clothes for an evening party after work.']
By getting breakfast offered by breakfast clubs, pupils can _ .	"Many children would start school hungry without breakfast clubs, teachers have claimed. A new survey suggests these clubs are the only way many students can get a meal before lessons. About 54% of the 552 school staff questioned by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers(ATL)said their school provides a breakfast club for pupils. The biggest reason for them to attend these clubs is that their parents or carer goes to work early, cited by 76.8% of those questioned. About 22.6% said children attended due to lack of money at home because parents or carers are unemployed and 15.2% said lack of money at home due to changes or cuts to benefits. About 17.6% said pupils mainly attend breakfast clubs to socialize. The survey found that teachers believe that offering breakfast to pupils often helps improve their concentration and ability to learn. One primary school teacher said: ""Although there is a charge for our breakfast club, we have accessed funding for those pupils on free school meals and the breakfast club had an effect on their attendance, concentration and being in school for the start of lessons. ATL general secretary Dr Roper said a nutritious meal at the start of the day has a huge impact on pupils' ability to learn. ""Many schools do everything they can to ensure children eat well during school term-time. But there are many children living in poverty, who we fear won't be getting a decent meal a day in the holidays and this is something the government needs to address,"" she said. A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We know how important it is for children to have a good breakfast. We want schools and local authorities to use their budgets to best meet the needs of their children. Many provide breakfast clubs which offer a free meal to children from poorer families. The Pupil Premium, which will double to PS 2.5 billion in 2014-2015, targets extra money to help schools to provide support such as this to the most disadvantaged children. The free school meal scheme also ensures that these children have access to a nutritious lunch every day."	['perform better in their study']

How well the members learn in the Project X program is shown by _ .	"As a group of young African immigrants struggle to adapt to life in the United States, an after-school drama program at White Oak Middle School aims to make their lives easier by first making them a little harder. Project X is a program that uses drama, dance, poetry and other creative outlets to help students discuss the tough and sometimes painful problems they face as pre-teen immigrants with language barriers. A final unveiling of their creation will be performed for friends and family at the end of the year at Imagination Stage. Wanjiru Kamau, coordinator of White Oak's African Club said it's important to give troubles to group members to help them find their place at the school. ""It comforts those who are uncomfortable, and it discomforts those who are comfortable,"" Kamau said of Project X. Kamau teamed up with Imagination Stage after she noticed that many African students seemed uncomfortable talking about problems, such as being laughed at by their fellow students about how they look and talk. When most of the kids join the club, they speak little or no English, Kamau said. Each week, the club typically draws five to ten students who are originally from Africa for discussion sessions and the Project X programme. ""We are going to express ourselves through our words and our actions, and that's powerful,"" said teaching artist Meg Green as she introduced fill-in-the-blank poems the students wrote about their identities. One student, Frank Ketchouang, 13, wrote, ""I am from the world; I am love,"" which drew oohs and aahs from the group. Ketchouang has been in the United States for less than a year, said Program Coordinator Chad Dike. When Ketchouang started attending Project X, he had been in the United States for two months and spoke no English. Now he's one of the group's most outgoing members and helps translate instructions from English to Creole for the group's newest member, who is from Haiti. Many people will give up when there's a language barrier, ""but these students prove them wrong"". Kamau said. ""You do have something to give. You are important. When TV, media, etc. are bringing them down, this program is bringing them up."""	['their annual creative performances']
Why did Ma Yan leave school for the first time?	"Ma Yan is not really a writer, but this 15-year-old girl has written a book that has moved many people around the world. Ma Yan's diary tells us about Ma's life. She lives in a poor village called Zhangjiashu in Tongxin, Ningxia, and she has no money to go to school. However, she is brave and wants to go to school very much. Her mother gave her diary to a reporter, Pierre Haski when he went to Zhangjiashu in 2001. Now, Ma Yan's diary has been published in France, Italy, Germany, Japan and China. Ma Yan is now a Junior Three student at Yuwang Middle School in Tongxin. Before this, she had to drop out of school twice. She had to stop going to school the first time, because her mum told her there was no money for her to go to school. She worked for 21 days and saved 13 yuan. With this money, she went back to school. The second time, her family told her she had to leave school while her two brothers could stay. ""I want to study,"" Ma Yan wrote in her diary. ""Why can boys study but girls can't? It would be wonderful if I could stay at school forever."" Ma Yan loves school so much because she wants to have a better life. ""My parents work hard in the fields but they are still poor. They have no knowledge . Most girls in my village leave school early and get married young. I don't want that kind of life,"" Ma Yan said. After her story became known, many students sent money to her. She hopes to go to Tsinghua University and become a reporter. ""Then, I can find poor kids like me, and help them,"" she said."	"[""Her family didn't have money for her to school.""]"
After hearing the husband's words, the wife felt _ .	"A man and his girlfriend were married. It was a large celebration. All of their friends and family came to see the lovely ceremony. Everyone could tell that the love they had for each other was true. A few months later, the wife came to the husband with a piece of advice, ""I read in a magazine, a while ago, about how we can strengthen our marriage,"" she offered. ""Each of us will write a list of the things that we find a bit annoying with the other person. Then, we can talk about how we can fix them together and make our lives happier together."" The husband agreed. So each of them tried to think of the things that annoyed them about the other and wrote down what they came up with. The next morning, at the breakfast table, they decided that they would go over their lists. ""I'll start,"" offered the wife. She took out her list. It had many items on it, enough to fill three pages. In fact, as she started reading the list of the little annoyances, she noticed that tears were starting to appear in her husband's eyes because he never thought that he had so many shortcomings. The wife continued to read until she had read all three pages to her husband. ""Now, you read your list and then we'll talk about the things on both of our lists,"" she said happily. Quietly the husband stated, ""I don't have anything on my list. I think that you are perfect. I don't want you to change anything for me. You are lovely and wonderful and I wouldn't want to try and change anything about you."" The wife, touched by his honesty and the depth of his love for her and his acceptance of her, turned her head and wept. In life, there are enough times when we are disappointed, depressed and annoyed. We don't really have to go looking for them. We have a wonderful world that is full of beauty, light and promise. Why waste time in this world looking for the bad, disappointing or annoying when we can look around us and see the wonderful things before us?"	['moved and ashamed']
Lucy thought her mother should feel happy because _ .	"A young mother thought that it was very wrong to waste any food when there were so many hungry people in the world. One evening, she was giving her small daughter her tea before putting her to bed. First she gave her a piece of bread and butter, but the child said that she did not want it like that. She asked for some jam on her bread as well. Her mother looked at her for a few seconds and then said, ""When I was a small girl like you. I was always given either bread and butter, or bread and jam, but never bread with butter and jam."" Lucy looked at her mother for a few moments with pity in her eyes and said to her kindly, ""Aren't you pleased to live a happy life this now?"""	"[""she had come to live today's happy life""]"
If you fail a test,what should you think according to the passage?	We all have our own ways of sharing our life experiences with others. Photographers use cameras, artists use brushes, musicians use songs and writers use stories. Spencer Johnson's story Who Moved My Cheese? shows changes exist in our life. Life changes and so we do. We must change ourselves to face the changing environment, or we will fail. Just look at the cycle of the seasons. Trees bud in spring and in summer their leaves turn green. In autumn, their leaves start to fall onto the ground. When winter comes, there are no leaves on trees. Next spring the cycle begins again. Since we know there are cycles in nature, we can prepare for them. We know it is colder in winter and hotter in summer, so we can dress properly. Since we accept the cycles of nature, we should also accept the changes in our life. We can prepare ourselves for changes by becoming more flexible . We can regard the changes in our life as chances. As we keep changing ourselves, we can keep up with the changes in our life.	"[""It's good for me because I know there are more to learn.""]"
According to the new findings, the researchers found that _ .	"New research shows that overweight or even mildly obese people have a lower risk of early death than people considered to be normal weight. Researchers examined the results of 97 studies. Most of the studies were less than 10 years old. They included almost three million adults from around the world, including the United States, Canada, China, Taiwan, Brazil, India and Mexico. The researchers at the National Center for Health Statistics found that people who are considered overweight or slightly obese were five to six percent less likely to die from all causes than people of normal weight. People with higher obesity ratings, however, had almost a 30 percent greater risk of death compared to normal-weight individuals. Katherine Flegal was the lead author of the study. She says she was not surprised that overweight people would not have a higher risk of death. ""Because we'd actually already read a lot of this literature and realized it was likely that mortality rates for overweight would be at least not higher than normal weight. I guess I was a little bit surprised that it was definitely lower. And I was also surprised that the lower rates of obesity also didn't seem to differ from normal weight."" But she says the difference in death rates appears to be small between normal-weight people and those who are overweight or mildly obese. The study has raised new questions about ""body mass index,"" or BMI. This is a measurement of body fat as a ratio of height to weight. In recent years, many public health experts have promoted body mass index as a way to predict the risk of health problems. Bu t a person's BMI can be misleading in some cases. Steven Heymsfield ,the executive director of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, says people can be physically fit and in good health, but might weigh more because they are more muscular. Still, Dr. Heymsfield says people should not think gaining extra weight is OK just because of the new findings. He says being at a healthy weight lowers the risk for heart disease and diabetes ."

The purpose of this article is _ .	"The Friends of the Amazon is a nonprofit association helping to preserve the forest, its wildlife and its native cultures in the Peruvian Amazon. We are located 3 degrees south of the equator in the Region of Loreto, which is roughly the size of Montana and is one of the richest areas in the world in terms of flora and fauna . Our team consists of lawyers, ecologists, sociologists, medical professionals and native Amazonians working together to protect the forest and its people from destruction. We use litigation , filing lawsuits against those who seek to destroy the forest and its native cultures. In addition to legal processes, we promote health, education, and the conservation of native plants and animals. The Amazon Rainforest is commonly referred to as the ""lungs of the planet"" whose trees are essential for absorbing carbon dioxide (CO2, a greenhouse gas that causes global warming) and it into oxygen, thereby mitigating the rise of global temperatures and climate change. An estimated 120 billion tons of carbon dioxide is absorbed in the Amazon Rainforest and global emissions of carbon dioxide increase with every tree of the rainforest that is cut down. That is why the survival of the Amazon Rainforest is vital for the survival of our planet, without which rising global temperatures could melt the polar icecaps and cause flooding of our coastal cities. Currently, the Amazon is under siege , with an estimated 1000 hectares being destroyed everyday. After harvesting old growth forests, corporations are often replacing the native forest with palm oil plantations instead of reforesting with native tree species. Palm oil trees are native to Africa, not the Amazon, and due to high profits, their promotion by international aid agencies and recent legislation in Peru, palm oil plantations represent perhaps the single greatest threat to the native Amazon Rainforest. In addition to conventional logging and deforesting to make room for crops such as palm oil and soybeans, the Amazon forest faces a new threat in the form of REDD projects and ""Carbon Cowboys"". REDD refers to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation by using carbon offsets (""carbon credits""). Under the guise of REDD projects, scammers are tricking native communities into signing unjust contracts in English without legal representation which essentially give these so called Carbon Cowboys the forest for free. These cheaters are making false promises of ""billions of dollars in profits"" from REDD and voluntary carbon offset projects by lying that they are representatives of the United Nations and World Bank in order to trick vulnerable indigenous Amazonians into ceding their land by signing unjust contracts with hidden clauses that give the Carbon Cowboys a power of attorney to do whatever they want with the forest for a period of 100 years. Friends of the Amazon is actively filing lawsuits against these Carbon Cowboys and those who support them.

"The sentence ""Later,she told a friend,'I felt like I was in heaven.'"" can be placed at the back of Paragragh _ ."	Historians say Harriet Tubman was born in the year 1820.Nobody really knows. But we do know that Harriet Tubman was one of the bravest women ever born in the United States. From a very early age,Harriet knew how slaves suffered. At six years old,she was sent to the fields. Working outside not only made her body strong but also made her learn about the Underground Railroad,on which she helped hundreds of people escape from slavery later. She also learned many things from the other slaves,which one day would help her lead her people to freedom. She became more of a rebel . In 1844,at about age 24,she married a free black man named John Tubman. By now,Harriet was sure she wanted to try to escape. Suddenly,the time came. Her owner died. Though opposed by her husband,she decided to escape. With the help of the Underground Railroad,and through a variety of suffering she finally crossed the border into Pennsylvania,where slavery was banned. Now that Harriet was free,she did not forget the hundreds of other slaves back in Maryland. Harriet traveled back and forth eighteen times,helping about 300 slaves escape into free territory. She became an expert at hiding from slave hunters. The people she helped called her Moses. At one time,anyone finding Harriet was promised $40,000 for catching her-dead or alive. During the Civil War,Harriet Tubman went into enemy territory to spy for the North. She also served as a nurse. After four years of bloody fighting,the North won the war. After the fighting ended,Harriet Tubman returned to Auburn,New York. She kept working. She traveled and gave speeches to raise money for better education for black children. She also worked for women's rights and housing. Harriet Tubman died in 1913.She was about 93 years old. By that time,she was recognized as an American hero. The United States government gave a funeral with military honors for the woman known as Moses.	['3']
The novel The Little Prince was written in the _ .	"If you love reading books, you must know about the book The Little Prince. It's a famous novel written by a French writer. As one of the best-selling books in history, it has been sold as many as 200 million copies in 253 languages and dialects . Now, around seventy years after the birth of the book, an American director has found a way to make it into a 3D animated film. The book tells the story of a pilot, called The Aviator, who crashes into the desert and meets a young prince there. However, in the film, the story starts years after the crash when The Aviator is much older. He has got a new neighbor called The Little Girl, whose mother wants her to get ready to enter the grown-up world. Slowly, the Aviator shares his story with The Little Girl by writing it down and sending her a page at a time. The pages are complete with the pictures in the book, speaking about his time in the desert and taking The Little Girl to an amazing world where anything is possible. China is the first country in the world to see the film in two versions--in Chinese and English. The film shows The Little Girl's life and tells The Little Prince's story at the same time in a beautiful way. Huang Lei, who voices the film together with his 9-year-old daughter, says the film is like a childhood dream which is lost by most adults in this stressed-out society. ""The most touching part is that every one of us was a good-natured kid like the Little Prince, and it's a pity that this good characteristic goes away as time flies,"" he says. ,"	['1940s']
The first night was hard for the players to fall asleep because _ .	Once a group of 17-year-old schoolboys decided to break the world basketball marathon record . They wanted to play for ninety hours and that is to add six hours to the record. Each team had nine players, with five at a time. The boys decided each person would play 21. 5 hours and then rest for 2 hours. Then they started at 6 o'clock in the evening. The first night was very hard for the players. When it was their turn to rest, they were too excited to fall asleep at once. After sleeping for a short time, they had to play again. On the second night, they fell asleep as soon as they stopped. Some of them had trouble with their feet and hands, but the only serious problem was a psychological one. Each boy was thinking:why am I doing this?How can I play any longer?After the third night, the players knew they could finish the ninety hours. The basketball on the fourth night was very slow. But in the final hours, the players got better. For the last few minutes, the players looked as fresh as when they started. How happy everyone was!	['they were too excited']

His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail in the back fence. The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Then _ began to become less. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the fence. Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, ""You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there. A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one.

How long did The Voice of China last?	"Last year The Voice of China, the most popular TV talent show became a popular topic in people's chatting and media information from both home and abroad. It began on July 13, 2012 and ended on September 30, 2012. Liang Bo, a handsome boy from Changchun, Jilin was the champion of The Voice of China in 2012. Before the competition Liang Bo was just an ordinary college student studying music. He captured the hearts of audience with his passionate rock'n'roll performance at the show. Fans described Liang's voice as ""natural, clear and touching''. Although he seemed cool on stage, he could quickly turn on the power once he started singing. ""His performances make you imagine things. When I listen to his singing, I see pictures and think of stories."" said Na Ying, one of the four judges on the show. She was also Liang's tutor for the competition. Liang Bo, like many young Chinese, he fell in love with music through playing the guitar. Liang got his first guitar as a birthday gift when he was in middle school. He would spend days and nights practicing. "" I can't live without my guitar."" he said. "" I don't like talking much but I carry great passion inside me,"" Liang said. "" There is no better way to let it out than through music like rock'n'roll. Many people compare Liang to famous Chinese rockers including Xu Wei, Wang Feng and Zheng Jun. But the young man doesn't want to stand in others' shadow. "" I respect those rockers, but I'm not going to copy them. I will be who I am,"" he said."	['More than two months.']
Visiting Granny on Sundays was a terrible experience because _ .	"I am beginning to wonder whether my grandmother isn't right when she complains, as she frequently does, that children nowadays aren't as well-behaved as they used to be. Whenever she gets the opportunity, she recounts in detail how she used to be told to respect the elders and betters. She was taught to speak only when she was spoken to, and when she went out on her own, she was reminded to say 'please' and 'thank you'. Children in her day, she continues, were expected to be seen and not heard, but these days you are lucky if you ever hear parents telling their children to mind their p's and q's. If you give her the chance, she then takes out of her drawer the old photograph album which she keeps there, and which she never tires of displaying. Of course when you look at pictures of her parents, you feel sure that, with a father as stern-looking as that, you too would have been ""seen and not heard"". He had a lot of neatly cut hair, long side-whiskers and a big moustache. In the photographs, he is always clutching his coat with one hand, while in the other he holds a thin walking stick. Beside him sits his wife, with their children around her: Granny and her elder brothers. It always occurs to me that perhaps those long, stiff, black clothes were so clumsy to a little girl, that she hadn't enough breath left to be talkative, let alone mischievous . It must have been a dull and lonely life too, for she stayed mainly at home during her childhood, while her brothers were sent away to school from an early age. Despite their long black shorts and their serious expressions in the photographs, I always suspect that their lives were considerably more enjoyable than hers. One can imagine them telling each other to shut up or mind their own business, as soon as their parents were out of sight. Going to see Granny on Sundays used to be a terrible experience. We would always be warned in advance to be on our best behavior, since my mother made a great effort to show how well brought up we were, in spite of our old, comfortable clothes, our incomprehensible (to Granny) slang, and our noisy games in the garden. We had to change into what Granny described as our ""Sundays best"" for lunch, when we would sit uncomfortably, kicking each other under the table. We were continually being ordered to sit up straight, to take our elbows off the table, to wait till everybody had been served, not to wolf down our food, nor to talk with our mouths full. At length we would be told to ask to be excused from the table and ordered to find quiet occupations for the rest of the day. We were always very bad-tempered by the evening, and would complain angrily all the way home. Yet though we hated the Sunday visit, we never questioned the rules of good manners themselves. I remember being greatly shocked as a child to hear one of my friends telling her father to shut up. I knew I could never have spoken like that to my father and it would never have occurred to me to do so. However, my childhood was much freer than Granny's. I went to school with my brother and I played football with him and his friends. We all spoke a common language, and we got up to the same mischief. I would have died if I had had to stay indoors, wear a tight dress, and sew. But I do sometimes look wistfully at an old sampler which hangs in the hall, which was embroidered by an even more distant relative--my great-great-aunt, of whom, regrettably, no photograph remains. It was done as an example of her progress in learning. The alphabet is carefully sewn in large colored childish letters from A to Z, and below it a small verse reads: Mary Saunders is my name, And with my needle I worked the same, That by it you may plainly see What care my parents have for me. It must have taken that little five-year-old months and months of laborious sewing, but, in a circle in a bottom corner of the sampler, there is a line: ""Be Ever Happy""."

To a dog lover, what kind of calendars does he want to buy?	The New Year is the time to buy a new calendar . Yet it can take a lot of time just to choose the right one. There are lots and lots of choices. There are small ones. Big ones. Calendars sit on a desk. Calendars hang on the wall. Calendars are carried around. In one way all calendars are the same. They all list the same days of the year in exactly the same order. Calendars have become popular gifts because many are filled with beautiful pictures. Some have pictures of famous art works. It is like hanging a different painting on your wall each month. You can even learn from calendars. They often give information about their subject--such as famous writers or American Indians or flower gardens. There are calendars about food and about beautiful places in the world. Calendars about sports and about movies. Funny calendars with popular cartoon characters. For pet lovers, there are calendars with pictures of cats doing unusual things. Three hundred sixty-five of them--one for each day of the year. There are calendars with pictures of cars, too. There are even calendars for children who can draw the pictures themselves. Some people do not just look at their calendars. They use them to write down important things they must remember, like meetings or doctor's appointments. Busy people can buy small calendars to carry around to help them organize and plan their life. Since there are so many choices, you must spend your time choosing your favourite calendars.

We can put our faith in the following things of success except_.	Just as the stock market rises and falls in response to what people are willing to put their money behind, we have inside ourselves an inner economy that rises and falls in response to our beliefs about what is possible. Sometimes the degree to which we are willing to challenge our belief systems determines the success of our inner economy. For example, imagine that your family of origin had a belief that musical talent was not something they possessed. As a member of that group, you would likely inherit that same belief about yourself. As a result, even if you had a great desire to create music, you might be hesitant to really get behind yourself, fearing that your investment would not pay off. Even if you had the courage to follow your passion, your inner belief that you are not inherently talented would probably be a major drawback to investing your energy in your dream. On the other hand, if you found a way to release that negative belief, a great flood of energy would pour forth, greatly increasing the likelihood of your success. How much energy we are willing to invest in the various ideas, dreams, and visions we carry within is like the money people are, or are not, willing to invest in the various products available for trade on the stock market. And in both cases, belief plays a key role in determining how willing we are to get behind something. One way to open up the possibility for greater success in our inner economies is to understand that belief is not the reliable guide we sometimes think. There are other more reliable things of success that we can put our faith in, such as passion, feeling, and sense. Some of the most successful investors in the stock market are the ones that go against the grain (to be something that one does not like doing), trusting their sense over the common opinion held by common people about what will work. In the same way, we can learn to trust our heart's desires and our sense to guide us, questioning any beliefs that stand in the way of our ability to fully invest in ourselves. As we take out energy from limiting ideas about what is possible, we free up the resources that have the power to make our inner economy prosper.	['stock market']
How many people took the train trip during the peak period surrounding the 2008 Spring Festival holiday?	Look! There are thousands of people waiting to buy tickets home in the railway station. Each time when Spring Festival comes, buying tickets of train trip would be very hard. And things seem to be getting worse and worse, although we have greatly increased the mileage of railway network and speeded up trains. Why? It's because too many people want to go back home to spend Spring Festival with their family. Many people become angry with the Ministry of Railways. They wonder why it is hopeless for them to get the tickets from the railway station Instead, they sometimes can only buy them from ticket scalpers at much higher price. The Ministry of Railways estimated that about 188 million passengers would travel by train during the 40-day peak period surrounding the 2009 Spring Festival holiday. The number of travelers will be 8% higher than that of 2008. This problem even drew the President Hu Jintao's attention. He wrote a note to Liu Zhijun,Minister of the Ministry of Railways, asking him to take action to improve passenger convenience. Afterward, officials from the Ministry of Railways said they would try their best not to let any ticket-buyers spend Spring Festival at the railway station.	['About 174 million.']
What might be the best title for the text?	Riding on an exercise bike at home may keep you in physical shape, but it can get pretty boring after a while. Aaron Puzey had been on his exercise bike for half an hour a day for years when he decided to look for a way to make it a bit more fun. With virtual reality technology widely available nowadays, all be needed to do was find a way of applying it to his needs. So he set out to build an app for the Samsung Galaxy Gear VR headset which would allow him to hook it up to Google Street view and make it seem like he's cycling through different real-life locations. Building the app to download the 3D data from Street View and make it viewable in the VR headset was the toughest part of his project. Other than that, all he needed to do was tape a Bluetooth monitor to his exercise bike. Although the quality of the images sometimes leaves a lot to be desired,leaving complex scenes like trees looking like a mess,Aaron has been having a lot of fun on his journey. Aaron's project is obviously no substitute (> for real outdoor cycling as it Lacks things like the wind blowing in your face or the pain of battling an uphill climb, bul it has given him a goal, as well as the chance to take in the beauty of places he might have otherwise never seen. It definitely beats staring at a wall or at the TV for 30 minutes, anyway. Obviously, Aaron's setup theoretically allows him to ride a bike anywhere around the world. He says he ba6 always wanted to see Japan, so once his ride comes to an end, he plans to start another one across the Land of the Rising Sun.	['Cycling Across the World at Home']

Who did Lily go to Hong Kong with last winter holiday?	"My name is Lily. I'm a junior high school student from Guangzhou. Last winter holiday, I visited Hong Kong for the first time with my mother and her workmates. Before we went through the entrance of the Customs and Excise Department (,CED), we had to wait for more than four hours there. All the passengers must show their permits to the workers at the CED one by one. So there were a large number of people waiting in lines at the entrance hall. It took us a long time to walk along the metal pipes which divided the big hall into many different parts. So the entrance hall looked like a huge puzzle. Everyone should finish walking through the puzzle if they wanted to pass the entrance. I waited patiently and walked slowly after others. I just could see the back of their heads. It was difficult for me to breathe because too many people were there. At last I passed it but I was too tired to say a word. Last month I visited Hong Kong again. But this time I didn't spend much time waiting at the entrance of the CED because I got an Electronic Exit Permit with an ""Electronic Brain"" in it. When I passed the port of Hong Kong, I just needed to use it to touch the button at the entrance. It can save much time for people. I plan to visit Hong Kong again sometime in the future."

What's the writer's attitude towards Arafat's future, judging from the last sentence of the passage?	"He has lived through various dangers but time may be running out for the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him, following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel. ""He should be punished for the killings,"" an Israeli official said, ""He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups."" But the decision has angered many other countries. China said that Arafat is the true leader, elected by the Palestinian people, and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East. Other governments share this idea. Arafat himself said: ""They can kill me, but never get me out of my country."" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel. But, just like a cat with nine lives, Arafat escaped every time. For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night, thinking a moving person is harder to hit. In 1985, Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat. The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt. In 1992, the aircraft in which he was flying over North Africa broke in two during a crash landing. The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive. What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger. Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ram Allah in December 2001. When they saw the attackers coming, Arafat's bodyguards _ his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground. Seconds later, several bombs were dropped nearby. Though safe, his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat. But, Arafat, with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away, showed no fear at all. He stayed in the damaged office, talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel. All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others. But has he used up the last of his nine lives? Only time will tell."	['Doubtful.']
The passage leads us to the belief that _ .	"Danger-junkie orangutans in Borneo climb dead trees and shake then until they begin to fall. They scream with excitement as they cling to the falling tree. Just before the tree hits the ground the orangutans leap to another tree or vine, narrowly escaping death. While no one cab ask orangutans if they enjoy it as a person playing an extreme sport, one animal behaviorist sees this monkey fun as a bit of harmless thrill-seeking. A growing number of scientists agree that animals are conscious and capable of experiencing basic emotions , such as happiness, sadness, boredom or depression. A few scientists even see the possibility for higher animal emotions like love, jealousy and spite. Five years ago, behaviorist and animal-rights activist Dr. Jonathan Balcombe stood on a Virginia hotel balcony watching two crows intimately groom each other in the comfort of an abandoned billboard. He felt that the birds liked what they were doing, even if engaged in a natural, beneficial act, such as picking parasites off the other's feathers. That moment changed the way he would view animals forever and led to a book, ""Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good"", which is filled with hundreds of examples of animals living it up thanks to developed senses of touch, taste, sight, sound and smell. Balcombe recounts a favorite example of Kenyan hippos having high-end spa treatment in a fresh water spring. They splay their toes, open their mouths wide and wait for a school of cleaner fish to remove parasites and slough off dead skin, he recalls. Balcombe knows that the hippos and the fish both benefit from this arrangement. ""My interpretation is that it is also enjoyable for them ,"" he says."	['animals can experience emotions']
What does the passage mainly tell us?	"-American office workers spend an average of 52 hours a week at their desks, according to a statistic survey. Some might argue that not all that time is spent working,but still all those hours in windowless offices with artificial light can have an influence. A few green additions could have a large effect on worker happiness,according to the survey led by Tina Cade from Texas State University. ""We pretty much found out that if you had windows and plants or even if you just had plants in your office, you were more satisfied with your job,"" Cade told LiveScience. ""We thought it was important for offices because a lot of times people are looking for ways to keep employees happy and do all these expensive things like building a gym. Maybe for less investment they could put in a few plants in important places."" The team surveyed 450 office workers in Texas and the Midwest,asking questions about job satisfaction and the work environments. When asked about their overall life quality,82 said they felt ""content"" or ""very happy"". Only 69 percent of those who work with plants but without windows,and 60 percent of those who have windows but no plants, said they felt this way. The group of people who work without plants or windows were the most dissatisfied,with only 58 percent of them saying that overall they were ""content"" or ""very happy"". While no one who works with plants,windows,or both reported they felt ""miserable"", 0.8 percent of those who work in offices without either said they were ""miserable"". ""I was really surprised that having a plant in your office appeared to be more beneficial than having a window in your office,"" Cade said. ""Everybody says, 'I need a window!' but actually it seemed like a plant could be a suitable alternative."""	['Green plants can increase job satisfaction.']
What would have happened to her friend if the author had not cared about her?	"I can still remember the first day when I met my best friend. She had just moved into the neighborhood and her grandmother brought her down to meet me. I hid behind my mother and she hid behind her grandmother, scared to look at each other. Soon, we lost the shyness and started playing with each other, bike riding to each other's house and having sleepovers. In 7thgrade she was going through family problems. However, every summer we would always sit at each other's house and watch movies on TV and talk about all the boys we liked. It was last year when I noticed the problem. She suffered from clinical depression , and had to go to a hospital during the day. I was very sorry for her at first. But with the late night calls, and meeting each other halfway up the street at midnight, we still stayed in touch. I wanted to be there for her since her new best friend left her, and I knew I still cared about her like a sister. Yesterday she came to me and said this. ""I never knew what a best friend was until you were the only person that would stop me from cutting myself; the only person that ever made me feel better about myself and my problems. You didn't know this but I was trying to kill myself that very night you called me and I was crying. I owe you so much, and you didn't even know you were helping me. "" We both cried. And I guess a kind of lesson from my life so far is to never give up your friends. Even if they aren't as cool as others, or people think they are crazy, they need someone there. If you leave them, you will only be very sorry. So if friends need you, and you care for them, you should be always there for them."	['She would have killed herself that night.']
When a typhoon comes, we cannot	"Maybe you know floods, droughts, earthquakes, sandstorms and so on. But have you ever heard of typhoons? Typhoons are some of the worst storms, usually around the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. Most happen in July, August and September. How does a typhoon happen? When lots of sea water gets hot in the summer sun, it evaporates into the air. This makes the air hotter. _ It fills the space that is left. After the air gets warmer, it starts to move quickly, making wind. The wind goes in circles, and it keeps moving higher in the sky. The warmer the air gets, the quicker the wind moves. And when the wind moves faster than 30 meters a second, a typhoon begins. A typhoon has two parts. One is called the ""eye"". In the eye, the wind does not move so fast. The other part is the wall of clouds around the eye. This is where the strongest wind and hardest rains are. Typhoons are very dangerous. In 2004, Typhoon Yunna killed 164 people in Zhejiang, and 24 people were missing. In May 2006, Typhoon Pearl hit Guangdong and Fujian, and thousands of houses were damaged. What to do when a typhoon hits: *Stay inside, close all the windows and stay away from them. *Try to bring all of your things inside. Strong winds could even blow away your bikes! *Listen to the radio or TV for important information. *If you're told to go to a safer place, do so right away."	['stay outside with our bikes']
What's the writer's attitude to Wikipedia?	"What do you do when you need to look something up? Go to the library? Open an encyclopedia ? Click onto the Internet? These days, most people go straight to Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia. But how reliable is it? There is no denying the popularity and usefulness of Wikipedia. It attracts as many as 78 million visitors every month, and the site is available in more than 270 different languages. It's one of the most comprehensive resources available, which includes almost all details, facts and information that maybe concerned. It's got much more information than an ordinary encyclopedia. The site is updated on a daily basis by thousands of people around the world. Anyone with an Internet connection can log on and edit the contents or add a new page. And you don't need any formal training. Of course, there are some controls. Wikipedia has a team of more than 1,500 administrators who check for false information. And main targets for harmful comments(such as politicians) are _ to public editing. But with more than 16 million articles to keep an eye on, it isn't easy. So, while Wikipedia benefits from being constantly updated with information from all over the world, it's also open to ""vandals"" . Some of the damage is easy to notice. One person drew devil horns and a moustache on Microsoft chairman Bill Gates' photo, while another edited Greek philosopher Plato's biography to say he was a ""Hawaiian weather man who is wildly believed to have been a student of'Barney the purple Dinosaur' and to have been deeply influenced by his dog, Cutie"". But other things are harder to spot. The most common form of vandalism involves adding tiny items of false information into the biography of a famous person. Unbelievably, some of this misinformation has appeared in newspapers, with The Daily Mail, The Guardian and The Independent all having fallen victim to the dirty tricks. For example, in an article about British comedian Sir Norman Wisdom, one newspaper claimed that he co-wrote Dame Vera Lynn's wartime hit There'll be bluebirds over the White Cliffs of Dover. He did no such thing. And in another article, it was reported that TV Theme tune composer Ronnie Hazlehurst had written the S Club 7's hit Reach. Once again, not true. So, if you are going to use any information from Wikipedia, make sure you double-check it first."	['Objective']

The following things will be likely to happen in the hot weather EXCEPT _ .	"It will be hot--hot enough that most locals will have cleared town for cooler places. But because athletes competing at the 2004 Olympics have no choice but to stay in the hot weather, many plan to turn to science to stay cool. Some will put their hands in ice water just before competing and nearly all will be wearing fabrics designed with hot weather in mind. ""Normally we warm up before exercise,""said Gordon Sleivert, director of sports science and medicine at the Canadian Sport Center in Victoria, British Columbia.""But in this case we're taking the warm out of warm up. It's like pre-cooling."" Experts are predicting the average high this August in Athens will be 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with temperatures often reaching above 100(the average temperature in Sydney for the 2000 summer games was 64). Although some events, such as the marathon, will start early(1 a.m.) to avoid hot weather, _ Drinking lots of water will help athletes keep cool, but humidity remains a problem. The body's ability to cool down is weakened by damp air since sweat drips off the skin rather than evaporates ,resulting in dehydration without the cooling. ""Getting hot is a real problem because when our brains heats up, the brain waves are more like when you're really sleepy. Everything feels harder,"" said Sleivert."

What can we possibly conclude from the moving story?	"While going to the office, I found an old man lying by the side of the bus stop.He seemed very sick and poor.Instinctively.I gave him some money.After a few minutes, I realized that he was probably too sick to get up and buy something with that money.I was thinking about how to help him when my bus arrived, halting my brainstorm.I quickly got on and rode off. However, that night I couldn't sleep.I felt very angry at my own heartless and selfish behavior.How could I just walk away from that man without a thought for his suffering? I felt restless and very upset. The next morning, while waiting at the bus stop, I hoped to run into him again.But he wasn't there.I thought he may have gone to the sidewalk to sleep for the night.I looked around for him, but he had disappeared.Disappointed, I decided to check for him again on my way back. While returning from work that day, I came back to the bus stop and resumed my search for him. Thankfully, he was there.I quickly went to a nearby store and got him a blanket, some bread, and biscuits. When I handed them to him, he seemed very grateful.""Now I will be safe from the cold,"" he smiled. I also gave him some more money and told him to keep it safely.After being able to help him, I felt very at peace."	['The fragrance always stays in the hand that gives the rose.']
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"Many people say that they are working too many hours. They don't have enough time to relax or to stay with their family. Work hours are different from one country to another. In France, people spend about 1,646 hours a year at work. In Japan, however, people work about 2,159 hours a year. Why do people work so many hours? Some people work extra hours because they want to make more money. However, many companies don't pay overtime. Their workers don't get more pay for more work. Some people think it's their duty to work more hours. Some are afraid of losing their jobs if they don't work more hours. Many people say that their vacations are too short. In France, people get five weeks of paid vacation a year. In Germany, they get four to six weeks, and in the United States, two weeks. One study shows fewer than half of workers used all their vacation days. In Great Britain, there is a saying, ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."" If that is true, there must be a lot of dull people in the world."	['Not all companies pay their workers for more work.']
The Silk Road became less important because _ .	Runners in a relay race pass a stick in one direction. However, merchants passed silk, gold, fruit, and glass along the Silk Road in more than one direction. They earned their living by traveling the famous Silk Road. The Silk Road was not a simple trading network. It passed through thousands of cities and towns. It started from eastern China, across Central Asia and the Middle East, and ended in the Mediterranean Sea. It was used from about 200 BC to about 1300 AD, when sea travel offered new routes. It was sometimes called the world's longest highway. However, the Silk Road was made up of many routes, not one smooth path. They passed through what are now 18 countries. The routes crossed mountains and deserts and had many dangers of hot sun, deep snow and even battles. Only experienced traders could return safe. The Silk Road got its name from its most prized product. Silk could be used like money to pay taxes or buy goods. But the traders carried more than just silk. Gold, silver, and glass from Europe were much found in the Middle East and Asia. Horses traded from other areas changed farming practices in China. Indian merchants traded salt and other valuable goods. Chinese merchants traded paper, which produced an immediate effect on the West. Apples traveled from central Asia to Rome. The Chinese had learned to graft different trees together to make new kinds of fruit. They passed this science on to others, including the Romans. The Romans used grafting to grow the apple. Trading along the Silk Road led to world-wide business 2,000 years before the World Wide Web. The people along the Silk Road did not share just goods. They also shared their beliefs. The Silk Road provided pathways for learning, diplomacy, and religion.	['sea travel provided easier routes']
We can infer from the story that _ .	"Reached My Destination ""Ego has an enormous appetite, the more you feed it, the hungrier it gets."" --Nathaniel Bronner Jr. It has been two years, we have not met. Last time was when we were departing at Rome Airport as a procedure of joining different competitive firms. We exchanged our personal email IDs and I never realized my email ID was one with an error. We had been in six years of professional relationship that ended with a small misunderstanding. We never realized that we might not get a chance to clear it. We both had tough ego levels to shed off. In these two years work has always kept me busy. There have been instances where I wanted to write to him for his expertise advice but my ego always stopped me. And then one day flying to London for a conference was taking away my peace of mind. I knew he would be there as a part of the event from his firm. I thought to ignore him and behave professionally as an employee. Finally, I entered the conference hall. I was quick enough to realize that he would take over participants' attention with his confidence, and all I would do sitting there would be appreciating him, nodding my head as ""Yes to Yes"" and ""No to No"". Finally, he approached the stage. The very first line that fell into my ears was my name as he continued, ""I am proud to be here with 8 years of experience and I would like to share my best practices with all of you. This is a journey I completed with one of my best colleagues and my best friend 'my name' who supported me through day and night with the toughest projects and killing deadlines"". For a moment I fell numbed and completely lost. All I could remember were my thoughts for him before entering the room and his greatness to acknowledge my presence. Finally, the conference ended and we all left for refreshment. I was struggling hard to face him. I saw him coming towards me with a gift. I asked him, ""Why this gift?"" He was very humble to answer, 'This is a small symbol of friendship to tell how much I missed my friend when I wanted her the most. A small token to represent that even when you were not with me, your teachings helped me to work on difficult projects."" I asked curiously, ""But you never wrote to me, if I was so important and helpful."" He replied, ""You left me with an email ID that is not reachable, maybe you missed a letter. I had no number to call you either but when I read your name in the list, I did all these arrangements. We never know when we meet again in life, so this gift is for you my friend."" Finally, we again departed to our respective destinations but this time with a smile."	['the writer and her friend treasured their friendship']
From Paragraph 3, we know that when someone is telling a joke, _ .	"In ancient Japan, if you saved someone's life, they would make it their duty to spend the rest of their life serving you. Nowadays, if you rescue someone's story, he or she will feel the same kind of gratitude . It happens all the time. Someone in a group is telling a story and, just before their big point, BOOM! There's an interruption. Someone new joins the group, a waiter with a plate of biscuits comes over, or a baby starts crying. Suddenly everyone's attention turns to the new arrival, the food on the plate, or the ""charming"" little child. Nobody is aware of the interruption -- except the speaker. They forget all about the fact that the speaker hasn't made his or her point. Or you're all sitting around the living room and someone is telling a joke. Suddenly, just before his big punch line , little Johnny drops a dish or the phone rings. After the crash, everyone talks about little Johnny's carelessness. After the call, the subject turns to the upcoming marriage or medical operation of the caller. Nobody remembers the great punch line got unfinished -- except the joke teller. When it's you entertaining everyone at a restaurant, have you ever noticed how you can almost set your clock by the waiter coming to take everyone's order just before your funny punch line? Most joke and story tellers are too shy to say, after the interruption, ""Now, as I was saying..."" Instead, they'll spend the rest of the evening feeling bad they didn't get to finish. Here's where you come in. Rescue them with the technique I call ""Lend a Helping Tongue."" Watch the gratitude in the storyteller's eyes as he stabilizes where his story sunk and he sails off again toward the center of attention. His expression and the appreciation of your consideration by the rest of the group are often reward enough. You are even more fortunate if you can rescue the story of someone who can hire you, promote you, buy from you, or otherwise lift your life. Big winners have excellent memories. When you do them subtle favors like Lend a Helping Tongue, they find a way to pay you back."	"[""listeners' attention is often drawn to something else""]"
When texting, the pedestrians walk in a different way to _ .	"People who have the habit of texting while walking tend to develop a robot-like posture, lose their balance, and involve themselves in traffic accidents, according to a research from the University of Queensland. Researchers said that text-walkers are in danger of walking into traffic and train tracks among others. They suggest pedestrians stop aside, type a text and then continue walking. For the study, the researchers tracked body movements of 26 young men and women while walking in a straight line over a distance of about 8.5 m ---once without a mobile phone, once while reading a text message and once while typing a message. They found that participants' body movements were greatly changed when they used their phone. The difference in their posture was more _ while sending a text than while reading a message. They further said that when those people began texting while walking, they slowed down their pace, went off course and moved their necks less than when reading a message. ""We found that they 'locking' their arms, trunk and head together walked with a posture that was robot-like, all in aid of keeping their phone in their field of vision. So there is less movement between each of their body parts."" Researcher Siobhan Schabrun said, Daily Mail UK reports. ""In recent years, there have been many reports of people involved in traffic accidents because they were texting while walking. The number of pedestrian accidents is rising and texting has been blamed,"" Schabrun said. Despite such repeated accidents, only few studies have analyzed the impact of texting on body language. If more studies concentrate on walking styles adopted while texting, their findings can be used to lower whole accidents. While a few U.S. states have introduced laws on texting while driving, Fort Lee, a New Jersey town, went further ahead and recently fined some walkers an $85 for catching them texting. It is hoped that other American states and countries will follow."	['keep their eyes steady on the phone']
In the book Life of Pi the hyena is killed by _ .	"First published in 2001, the book Life of Pi written by Canadian author Yann Martel won the Man Booker Prize and an Asian American Prize for Literature. It is the story of a young boy named Pi who spends 227 days at sea with a small group of animals after disaster strikes their ship and is an account of his journey of survival and hardship. Piscine ""Pi"" Molitor Patel, on whom Life of Pi is based, is a young boy living in Pondicherry, India, where his father owns a zoo. The story starts when Patel's family decide to move to Canada, along with their zoo animals for their new home. However, because of the bad weather, the ship sinks. Pi along with an orangutan , an injured zebra, a hyena and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker are the only survivors who take shelter in a small lifeboat. Both the injured zebra and the orangutan are soon killed and eaten by the hyena. The tiger in turn kills and eats the hyena, leaving just the two of them alone on the boat now. In an effort to avoid being eaten by Richard Parker, Pi acts himself as the head of the group and remains safe from harm. Since he does not want the tiger to die for fear of going mad by being alone on the boat, he fishes and feeds the two of them in order to stay alive. The life of Pi then enters its third stage when their lifeboat washes up on the shores of Mexico and the tiger escapes into a nearby forest leaving Pi alone. After the Mexicans refuse to believe Pi's story, he changes his tale by replacing the animals with his mother, a cook and a sailor and asks the Mexicans which one they prefer. They prefer hearing the first story though they do not believe a word of it. In my view, Life of Pi is a must read book for all those who love reading."	['Richard Parker']
What's the advantage of file sharing for recording companies?	"Protecting Copyright Having finished her homework, Ma Li wants some music. As usual, she starts her computer and goes to Baidu.com to download music files. But this time she is surprised when an announcement about protecting songs' copyright bursts onto the screen. The age of free music and movie downloads may have come to an end as Web companies like Baidu are accused of pirating copyright. Lawsuits have been filed against four websites offering free downloads. In September 2005, a Beijing court ordered Baidu to pay recording company Shanghai Push compensation for their losses. Baidu was also told to block the links to the pirated music on the website. This caused a heated discussion on Interact file sharing. ""Baidu's defeat in the lawsuit shows it is not right to get copyrighted songs without paying. Down loaders may face lawsuits or fines,"" said an official. Like many teens, Huang Ruoru, an 18-year-old girl from Puning in Guangdong Province, doesn't think that getting music from websites is wrong. She always shares her favourite songs downloaded from Baidu with her friends. When told about the lawsuit, she began to feel a little guilty about obtaining others' work without paying. However, other teenagers have different ideas. Wang Yafei, a Senior 2 girl from Jinan, Shandong Province pointed out that file sharing is a good way to promote pop singers. ""If I download a song and really like it, I will buy the CD,"" she said. ""So what the recording companies really should concentrate on is improving their music, rather than file-sharers."""

Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?	"In the mid-1950s, I was a somewhat bored early-adolescent male student who believed that _ . One day, this approach threw me into embarrassment In Mrs. Totten's eighth-grade math class at Central Avenue School in Anderson, Indiana, we were learning to add and subtract decimals . Our teacher typically assigned daily homework, which would be recited in class the following day. On most days, our grades were based on our oral answer to homework questions. Mrs. Totten usually walked up and down the rows of desks requesting answers from student after student in the order the questions had appeared on our homework sheets. She would start either at the front or the back of the classroom and work toward the other end. Since I was seated near the middle of about 35 students, it was easy to figure out which questions I might have to answer. This particular time, I had completed my usual two or three problems according to my calculations. What I failed to expect was that several students were absent, which threw off my estimate. As Mrs. Totten made her way from the beginning of the class,I desperately tried to determine which math problem I would get. I tried to work it out before she got to me, but I had brain freeze and couldn't function. When Mrs. Totten reached my desk,she asked what answer I'd got for problem No. 14. ""I...I didn't get anything,"" I answered,and my face felt warm. ""Correct,"" she said. It turned out that the correct answer was zero. What did I learn that day? First, always do all your homework. Second, in real life it isn't always what you say but how you say it that matters. Third,I would never make it as a mathematician. If I could choose one school day that taught me the most, it would be that one."	['A Valuable Lesson']
What can we learn about Mary?	"Recently I fully understood that a little favor could really make a big difference. My daughter and I were, accidentally, in time to catch a falling heart just before it hit the ground. It all started when Charlene, one of my co-volunteers at the library, asked if I could do her duty on Tuesday since her doctor appointment had been unexpectedly changed. I agreed, which meant I was home on Friday instead of volunteering as previously planned. My daughter, Mary, managers a book store in town. Mid-morning, she called to ask me for help. Would I buy a fifty dollar gift card, birthday card, and cake for one of Mary's assistant managers, Cindy? Mary explained she had to call Cindy in to take the place of another assistant manager who was sick, but felt terrible about it when she discovered it was Cindy's birthday. Cindy insisted that it was just fine. But that was not what Mary thought, so she gathered enough money from other employees to throw a surprise party for Cindy. Since neither Mary, nor any of the other employees, could leave to pick up the _ , they were turning to me for help. Days later, Mary told me the wonderful rest of the story, ""Cindy cried and cried when we surprised her. After the party, Cindy told us that her boyfriend had chosen that morning to break up with her. To top that off, she only had 26 cents left in her bank account."" We were surprised at the series of unexpected events that took place in order to circle Cindy with love and catch her falling heart just before it hit the ground."

How can we ensure that we have choices if we lose the main source of income?	In this fast-shifting world, there can be no guarantees attached to any particular job. But there is much that you can do to protect yourself from the change of society, by equipping yourself with the skills to manage your career more effectively. You need to be a career activist. If you lost your main source of income tomorrow, could you find a different source to replace it? The most important thing in protecting yourself now and in the future is ensuring that you have choices. Don't let yourself be held back by a lack of skill development, or fear of change. Some people have been good performers in their own organization but discovered that they are stuck. Because they are so closely related to a particular company or industry, their skills are not readily transferred to other jobs. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. If you limit yourself to one particular area or sector, you limit your opportunity, too. In a global market place, many jobs come and go quickly as changes in the stock market. Today's hottest job may not exist tomorrow. If you love computers, then this work represents a great choice. But don't enter a field just because you think that's where the hot jobs are; even if the job is available, it may not match well with your own skills and abilities. Start with entry of your own strengths and interests, then see where you may match up best in the job market.	['Try to develop our skills and be a career activist.']

Where does this passage possibly come from?	"A great loss--Shirley Temple dies at 85 February 12,2014 BYDERRIKJ.LANG ,Associated Press Shirley Temple Black, who died on February 10that age 85, wasn't just a child star. She was THE child star--the sweet little girl whose shining smile helped _ some of the darkest days the US has known during the Great Depression. It's hard today to imagine the super star Shirley was once ""America's Little Darling"". She sang and danced her way to the top of the box office in such films as Bright Eyes, Curly Top and Heidi. By 1940, she had appeared in 43 films. Temple teamed with Bill Robison in four movies, and their dance on the stairs in The Little Colonel is still a legendary film moment. In the 1930s, her name on a movie introduction assured a packed house. She inspired dolls, dresses, dishes--even a drink (alcohol-free, of course). US President Franklin D. Roosevelt once famously said that ""as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right.'' Unlike so many of today's child stars, Temple didn't end up with her name appearing across the headlines for bad behaviors. Instead of getting her photos on front pages or struggling with drugs and alcohol, Temple went on to a second career in diplomacy , including presidential appointments as ambassador to Ghana. She surprised a lot of people who doubted her with her grace, knowledge and eagerness to serve. In fact, her career in public service (20 years) was longer than her career in movies (19). The role she valued most, however, was as wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. The world has lost a treasured Hollywood legend. But her movies will allow that little dynamic figure to continue charming audiences for a very long time."	['A newspaper.']
The passage is mainly about _ .	"The biggest danger facing airlines nowadays may not be a terrorist with a gun, but the man with portable computer in business class. In the last 16 years, pilots have reported well over 100 incidents that could have been caused by electromagnetic interference . The source of this interference remains not proved, but increasingly, experts are pointing the blame at portable electronic devices such as portable computers, radio and cassette players and mobile telephones. RTC.A. an organization which advises the aviation ( )industry, has suggested that all airlines ban such devices from being used during ""critical"" stages of flight particularly take-off and landing. Some experts have gone further, calling for a total ban during all flights. Currently , rules on using these devices are left up to individual airlines. And although some air- lines prevent passengers from using such equipment during take-off and landing, most are unwilling to carry out a total ban, given that many passengers want to work during flight. The difficulty is predicting how electromagnetic fields might affect an aircraft's computers. Experts know that portable devices send out radiation which affects those wavelengths which aircraft use for navigation and communication. But, because they have not been able to reproduce these effects in a laboratory, they have no way of knowing whether the interference might be dangerous or not. The fact that aircraft may be fragile to interference raises the risk that terrorists may use radio systems in order to damage navigation equipment. As worrying,though, is the passenger who can 't hear the instructions to turn off his radio because the music's too loud."	['a possible cause of aircraft incidents']
Which of the following can NOT the players experience while playing the new game?	"Ever wondered how one person could save the planet from the effects of climate change? A British-made computer game on trial release on Monday creates different ways of doing just that. ""Fate of the World""puts the Earth's future in players' hands, placing them in charge of an international environmental body which could save the world from the effects of rising greenhouse gas emissions or let it destroyed by more emissions. Through different scenes, players can explore options such as geoengineering and alternative energy sources to save the planet from rising temperatures, decreasing natural resources and a growing population over the next 200 years. An improved version of the game will be followed by a three-month feedback period from players, with final release due in February next year. Created by Oxford-based games developer Red Redemption, the game is different from other mainstream action games mainly by using data from real climate models and advice from scientists and economists. ""Science data is often inaccessible and we are trying to put players in a position of power and connected with the issues,"" Gobion Rowlands, Red Redemption's founder and chairman said. This year, a series of apparent errors in climate science and the failure of UN talks to reach an international deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions appeared to weaken the public's interest in climate change. However, games centered on sustainability and human rights have been growing in popularity and are welcomed by green groups as a way of raising awareness. Using climate change as inspiration for entertainment shows the issue has affected global culture, which can only be a good thing.Friends of the Earth's head of climate Mike Childs said.""We need creative industries to work with these big issues as the results can be extremely powerful and can help us to understand what a sustainable future looks and feels like,""he added."

Which is NOT the purpose of the Marine Mammal Program?	"In a little-known part of the counter-terrorism world, one of the most effective detection systems is a 600-pound animal that works for about 20 pounds of fish a day. Since the 1960s, the United States and a handful of other countries have trained dolphins and sea lions to detect sea mines and swimmers, to recover inert torpedoes and to test objects used in Naval exercises. Program officials estimate that the sea lions in the Marine Mammal Program have recovered millions of dollars of U.S. Naval torpedoes and instrumentation dropped on the sea floor. The U.S. Navy kept its Marine Mammal Program a secret until the 1990s, and this spring CNN became one of only a handful of media outlets to see firsthand how the program works. The program has trained about 75 Pacific bottlenose dolphins, with natural biosonar that tracks better than any manmade device; and 35 California sea lions, with superb underwater eyesight. Not only do these trained marine mammals track and _ millions of dollars in U. S. military equipment, they are also helping to save lives. The Navy won't disclose whether the dolphins and sea lions have effectively intercepted terrorists attempting to do harm to any U.S. facilities. ""Either way, it serves as a deterrent effect."" says Christian Harris, operations supervisor for the program. The mammals can be deployed via C-130 cargo aircraft to perform their missions anywhere in the world within 72 hours. They have been used in exercises from Alaska to Hawaii, operating in great temperature and environmental ranges. They also have the capability to operate off vessels. Dolphins most recently were deployed in the Iraq war, performing mine detection and clearance operations in the Persian Gulf to ensure safe passage for humanitarian ships delivering aid. Some of these Iraq war ""veterans"" are now back home, tasked with a new mission: guarding nuclear submarines in their homeports of Bremerton, Washington, and Groton, Connecticut."

Tiangong -- 1(or.Heavenly Palace)space module is the first step toward China's plan to build a space station around 2020.Its launch by China has upset some countries,which are asking why China did not add on to the International Space Station that has been in place since 1998. After all, the Americans,Russians,Europeans and Japanese are using one platform to experiment in space. Questions have also been asked about China's final purpose in space and suggestions made that there is something as unpleasant as the theme in a James Bond movie,in which Chinese-looking enemies were at the root of some evil plot to control the world. Chinese don't see themselves that way, and never in history have they been flag-planting settlers.Most Westerners are educated in the adventures of the great European explorers,headed by Christopher Columbus and James Cook,and followed closely by the groups of culture egotists with a mix of guns,gold and the Bible in their hands. In comparison,Zheng He,the great Chinese sailing master,took groups of ships to Africa and the Middle East to promote goodwill, with gifts of chinaware and art.No flags claiming possession of distant areas.But this is strange to Western society. In this century,it is clear that space cannot be claimed by one nation.Yet advantage of technology in space does seem to be on some minds.Former US president Ronald Reagan caused shocks and worries with his Star Wars program.So when China shot down its own satellite as a test in January 2010 there were anxieties in the West about Star Wars 1ike scenario becoming reality in the near future.

A friend of the writer's drew the horses _ .	"A friend of mine was fond of drawing horse. He drew the horses very well, but he always began the tail. Now it is the Western rule to begin at the head of the horse, that is why I was surprised. It struck me that it could not really make any difference whether the artist begins at the head or the tail or the belly or the foot of the horse, if he really knows his business. And most great artists who really know their business do not follow other people's rule. They make their own rules. Every one of them does his work in a way peculiar( ) to himself; and the peculiarity means only that he finds it more easy to work in that way. Now the very same thing is true to literature. And the question, ""How shall I begin?"" only means that you want to begin at the head instead of beginning at the tail or somewhere else. That is, you are not yet experienced enough to trust to your own powers. When you become more experienced you will never ask the question, and I think that you will often begin at the tail -- that is to say, you will write the end of the story before you have even thought of the beginning."

Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?	More than 20 million kids in the United States live with one parent. Separation and divorce are the most common reasons for this. In other cases, the mom and dad may never have lived together, or one of them may have died. Living with one parent instead of two can bring about a lot of emotions. These feelings can be pretty strong, and they can be confusing, too. You might feel terribly sad and angry because your parents divorced. Single parents are often working parents because someone needs to earn money to buy food, clothing, and a place to live in. Having a job means your mom or dad is able to provide these things and more for you. People work for other reasons, too. A job can let a person use his or her special talents and skills. A job can be important because it helps people in the community. But even though you might understand why your mom or dad has to work, sometimes it can be hard to accept. This can be especially true during the summer or school vacations. _ It can be tough when you don't have enough time with your dad or mom. When you live with one parent, that person really has to do the work of two people. Besides a job, your mom or dad is responsible for caring for the kids, the house, the yard, the car and the pets. So what can you do ? One of the best ways is to hold a family meeting. Talk about everyone's schedule for work, school, and activities. You can also talk about what jobs around the house need to be done every day. You might want to help your parent cook dinner sometimes. That can be both fun and helpful to your parent. Maybe you can also schedule a weekly game or a movie at night.	['Kids can also talk about what jobs in their school can be done at a family meeting.']

"You should say ""Thank you"" when _ ."	"American people like to say ""Thank you"" when others help them or say something kind to them. People of many countries do so, too. It is a very good habit . You should say ""Thank you"" when someone passes you the salt on the table, when someone walking ahead of you keeps the door open for you, when someone says you have done your work well, or you have bought a nice thing, or your city is very beautiful. ""Thank you"" is used not only between friends, but also between parents and children, brothers and sisters. ""Excuse me"" is another short sentence they use. When you hear someone say so behind you, you know that somebody wants to walk past you without touching you. It's not polite to break others when they are talking. If you want to speak to one of them, say ""Excuse me"" first, and then begin talking. You should also do so when you begin to cough or make any noise before others. Let's learn to say ""Thank you"" and ""Excuse me"". :"	['someone helps you']
When do dolphins copy the signature whistles of loved ones?	"Dolphins call out the specific names of loved ones when they become separated, a study finds. Other than humans, they are the only animals known to do this, according to the study. The big difference with dolphins is that these communications consist of whistles , not words. Earlier research found that dolphins have a ""signature whistle"" that would be somewhat like human shouting, ""Hey everybody! I'm an adult healthy male named George, and I mean you no harm. "" The new finding is that dolphins also say the names of certain other dolphins. ""Animals produced copies of the same sound when they were separated from a close partner. This supports our belief that dolphins copy another animal's signature whistle when they want to reunite with that animal,"" Stephanie King, who led the study, says. King and her colleagues collected acoustic data from wild dolphins around Sarasota Bay, Florida, from 1984 to 2009. The researchers also studied four adult male dolphins _ at the Seas Aquarium, also in Florida. Those males are adults that keepers named Calvin, Khyber, Malabar and Ranier, all of whom, as well as all of the wild ones, developed their own signature whistles that served as names in communication with other dolphins. ""A dolphin uses its signature whistle to broadcast its identity and announce its presence. The signature whistles allow animals to identify one another over long distances and allow animals to recognize one another and to join up with each other,"" King explains. ""Dolphin whistles can be heard up to 20km away, depending on water depth and whistle frequency ."" The researchers said dolphins copy the signature whistles of loved ones, such as a mother, when the two are separated. These ""names"" are always used in positive situations, and are only directed toward loved ones. While researchers are often unwilling to apply the word language to non-human communications, dolphins clearly have a very complex communication system."	['When they are apart.']
Why did the little girl look sad one day?	"I watched a little girl playing basketball every day from my bedroom window. One day, I asked her why she practiced so much. She said, ""I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship . I like basketball and I want to be the best player in college. My dad told me, ""If the dream is big enough, the facts don't count."" She never changed her mind. Whenever she was in junior high school or senior high school. One day, before she graduate from senior high school, I saw her sitting on the grass sadly. I asked her what was wrong. She told me that her coach said she was too short to be a good basketball player, so she should stop dreaming about going to college. She was heartbroken and it made me feel bad, too. Then she smiled and told me her father said to her, ""If you really want to play for the scholarship of a good college, nothing but yourself can stop your dream."" The next year, she and her team went to a big game she was seen by a coach of a famous college team and was offered a scholarship to the women's basketball team of their college. She was getting the college education that she had dreamed of. ""If the dream is big enough, the facts don't count."" It is true."	['Her coach said she was too short to be a good player.']

What's the writer's attitude to being sad and depressed?	One of the most popular and enduring myths about depression is that depressed people are sad all the time--and that by extension, people who are happy can't be experiencing depression, even if they say they are. It is a mistaken version of depression. Depression doesn't make you sad all the time. When I'm having a depressive feeling, I'm not walking around in black clothes, and weeping. I go out with friends. I play jokes. I keep working, and have friendly chats with the people I work with. I read books. Above all, I experience moments of happiness. Yet I feel a strange conflicting pressure. On the one hand, I feel like I need to engage in a sort of sadness for people to understand that I really am depressed and that each day is a struggle for me. Because that way I will appear suitably sad, and thus, depressed--and then maybe people will recognize that I'm depressed and perhaps they'll even offer support and assistance. On the other hand, I feel an extreme pressure to perform just the opposite, because sad depressed people are boring and no fun, as I am continually reminded every time I speak openly about depression or express feelings of sadness and frustration. I'm caught in a trap where if I don't perform sadness, I'm not really depressed, but if I express sadness at all to any degree, I'm annoying and boring and should stop being so self-centered. Depression can become your master, but you can slip out from under it occasionally. And many depressed people don't actually spend it fainting dramatically on the couch and talking about how miserable they are.	['Negative.']
"At the end of the passage, the word ""we"" can best be replaced by ."	"It would be interesting to discover how many young people go to university without any clear idea of what they are going to do afterwards. If one considers the enormous variety of courses offered, it is not hard to see how difficult it is to select the course most suited to his interests and abilities. If a student goes to acquire a broader perspective of life, to enlarge his ideas and to learn to think for himself, he will undoubtedly benefit, since school often has too restricting an atmosphere, with its timetables and disciplines, to allow him much time for independent assessment of the work he is asked to do. Most students would, I believe, profit by a year or so's exploration of different academic studies, especially those ""all-rounders"" with no particular bent. They should have longer time to decide in what subject they want to take their degree, so that in later life they do not look back and say, ""I should like to have been an archaeologist. If I hadn't taken a degree in Modern Languages, I shouldn't have ended up as an interpreter, but it's too late now. I couldn't go back and begin all over again, even if I had the chance."" There is, of course, another side to the question of how to make the best use of one's time at university. This is the case of the student who excels in a particular branch of learning, is a first-rate mathematician, scientist, linguist and what you have. He is immediately accepted by the university of his choice, and spends his three or four years becoming a specialist, emerging with a first-class Honors Degree and very little knowledge of what the rest of the world is all about. It therefore becomes more and more important that, if students are not to waste their opportunities and, incidentally, the taxpayers' money, there will have to be much more detailed information about courses, more advice from Career Masters and Course Tutors if _ are not to bring up, on one hand, a band of specialists ignorant of anything outside their own subject, and on the other hand, an ever-increasing number of graduates qualified in subjects for which there is little or no demand in the working world."

What is the author's attitude towards connected cars?	"Since Henry Ford turned it into a mass-market product a century ago, the car has delivered many benefits. It has promoted economic growth, increased social mobility and given people a lot of fun. But the car has also brought many problems. It pollutes the air, creates traffic jams and kills people. An astonishing 1.24 million people die, and as many as 50 million are hurt, in road accidents each year. Drivers and passengers waste around 90 billion hours in traffic jams each year. In some car-choked cities as much as a third of the petrol used is burned by people looking for a space to park. Fortunately, a new technology promises to make motoring safer, less polluting and less tendency to hold-ups. ""Connected cars""--which may eventually develop into driverless cars but for the foreseeable future will still have a human at the wheel-can communicate wirelessly with each other and with traffic-management systems, avoid walkers and other vehicles and find open parking spots. Some parts of the transformation are already in place. Many new cars are already being fitted with equipment that lets them keep their distance and stay in a motorway automatically at a range of speeds. Soon, all new cars in Europe will have to be able to warn the emergency services if their on-board sensors discover a crash. Singapore has led the way with using variable tolls to smooth traffic flows during rush-hours; Britain is pioneering ""smart motorways"", whose speed limits vary constantly to achieve _ . Combined, these new inventions could create a much more highly effective system in which cars and their drivers are constantly warned of dangers and showed the ways, traffic always flows at the proper speed and vehicles can travel closer together, yet with less risk of crashing. In the past, more people driving meant more roads, more jams, more death and more pollution. In future, the connected car could offer mankind the pleasures of the road with rather less of the pain."

Fish and whales _ before the winter starts..	Winter is very cold in many countries. It's easy for you and me to keep warm. If we are cold, we can just buy a warm coat or use a heater and we will feel better. But what about animals? How do they keep warm in winter? Some animals migrate . This means they travel to places where the weather is warmer. Many birds leave before the winter starts. They fly in groups. If they fly together, the trip will be safer. They like to migrate to the same places every year. Do you know how they can find the same places? Scientists say that birds use the sun, moon and stars to help them. Other animals like moose also migrate. Fish and whales swim to warmer water. Some animals don't have leave their homes. They hibernate in winter. They fall into a very deep sleep. The animals' temperature drops and their breathing slows down. Before the winter, these animals must eat too much food that they get very fat. If they don't eat enough, they may die when they are hibernating.	['swim to warmer water']
The passage is mainly about _ .	"London's Chinese community dates back to the 18th century, when a small number of Chinese sailors moved to the city to work in Limehouse, east London. As time went by, other Chinese people came to this area and Limehouse began to be known as ""Chinatown"". At the start of the 20th century, there were just 545 Chinese people in Britain. However, this situation changed greatly after the Second World War. At this time, many farmers in Hong Kong lost their jobs, and decided to move to London. In the 1950s, a small Chinese restaurant opened in central London. Many British people visited it and said that Chinese food was wonderful! Suddenly, Chinese restaurants started opening in every part of the city. Instead of too little work, the new Chinese immigrants now found that they had too much! Most of the new immigrants enjoyed their lives and the chances they were offered. Many asked their friends and relatives to join them from their hometowns, and a lot of families were reunited again at this time. As time went by, London's Chinese community became more and more successful. The sons and daughters of the first restaurant workers, encouraged by their parents, studied very hard at school and university. And most got highly-paid jobs. As a result, increasing numbers of Chinese families left Chinatown and moved to the more expensive places. Chinatown, however, is still as lively as ever, and a must-see for any visitor to London."

After the author' s mum failed in her business, she _ .	"In the early 1980s, one of our neighbors asked my mom if she would make a few gift baskets for her [:]to give as gifts for the holidays. My mom agreed and news of the unique gift baskets my mum was making spread like wildfire throughout the neighborhood. My mum was busy throughout the holiday season, so she asked a friend to help her. When the orders continued after the holiday season for baby gifts, birthday gifts and more, it occurred to them that maybe this job could be turned into a business and they did it. My mum went into her business because she had a creative idea. She got orders and filled orders. But there was no purpose and no real strategy . In 1991, my mum' s partner got into financial trouble and there was not enough money to support either my mum or her partner. So if you are led by your creativity or enthusiasm, make sure you ask yourself what you want out of your business. If you don't set goals, how will you know what direction to go in? Do you want to create jobs and growth in the economy? Are you looking for a hobby? You can't keep scores if you don' t know what game you are playing. After my mom's partner gave up, she had to abandon her business to support herself. She swore she would run a business again and do it differently the next time. However, there wasn't a ""next time"" for her. She passed away just after her 51st birthday. She never had someone tell her how important having a goal was. She never had an opportunity to be everything that she could be. There are no right or wrong goals, only the ones that matter to you. Set them so that you can make progress and achieve success, whatever that may mean to you."	['reflected on her failure']

After having room service three nights at a hotel in Houston, however, I needed to get out of my room. Although the restaurant opened at 6:30, I arrived at 6:25. The waiter at the front desk made a comment about my ""being there really early"". I explained my dislike of eating alone in restaurants. He then seated me at a lovely table and asked me whether I would mind if he sat down with me for a while. I was glad! He sat and talked with me about his career goals and the difficulty of being at work on nights, weekends and holidays. He said he hadn't enough time to be with his family. After 15 minutes, he saw some customers at the front desk and excused himself. I noticed that before he went to the front desk, he stopped in the kitchen for a moment. Then another waiter came out of the kitchen and had a wonderful chat with me. Before I left that night, some other waiters, even the cook, had come out of the kitchen and sat with me! When I asked for my bill about one hour later, all the people who had sat down with me came over in a big group to my table, and presented me with a red rose. And I cried!

According to the passage, why is the shape of sea cucumbers important?	Certainly no creature in the sea is stranger than the common sea cucumber . All living creatures, especially human beings, have their features, but everything about the little sea cucumber seems unusual. What else can be said about an unusual animal that eats mud, feeds almost continuously day and night but can live without eating for long periods, and can be poisonous but is considered eatable? For some fifty million years, in spite of all its strange features, the sea cucumber has lived on its diet of mud. It is adaptable enough to live attached to rocks by its tube feet, under rocks in shallow water, or on the surface of mud flats. Common in cool water on both Atlantic and Pacific shores, it has the ability to suck up mud or sand and digest whatever nutrients are present. Sea cucumbers come in a variety of color1s, ranging from black to reddish-brown to sand-color1 and nearly white. One form even has brilliant purple tentacles . Usually the creature are cucumber-shaped--where their name comes from--and because they live in rocks, this shape, combined with flexibility, enables them to press into crevices where they are safe from animal eater and ocean currents. Although they have greedy desire for food, eating day and night, sea cucumbers have the ability to become still and live at a low metabolic rate--feeding a little or not at all for long periods, so that the living things in the ocean that provide their food have a chance to increase by a large amount. If it were not for this natural ability, they would swallow all the food available in a short time and would probably starve themselves out of existence. But the most impressive thing about the sea cucumber is the way it defends itself. Its major enemies are fish and crabs. When attacked, it forces all its internal organs in its body out into water. It also removes attached structures such as tentacles. The sea cucumber will get rid of its organs and grow itself again if it is attacked or even touched; it will do the same if the surrounding water temperature is too high or if the water becomes too polluted.

Which is the possible reason why Hooke accepted the job as Curator of Experiments?	"Inventor, physicist, surveyor, astronomer, biologist, artist... Robert Hooke was all there and more. Some say he was the greatest experimental scientist of the 17th century. In the course of his work, he cooperated with famous men of science like Isaac Newton, and the great architect, Christopher Wren. Hooke's early education began at home, under the guidance of his father. He entered Westminster School at the age of 13, and from there went to Oxford, where he came in contact with some of the best scientists in England. Hooke impressed them with his skills at designing experiments and inventing instruments. In 1662, at he age of 28, he was named Curator of Experiments at the newly formed Royal Society of London- meaning that he was responsible for demonstrating new experiments at the society's weekly meeting. Hooke accepted the job, even though he knew that the society had no money to pay him! Watching living things through a microscope was one of his favourite pastimes . He invented a compound microscope for this purpose. One day while observing a cork under a microscope, he saw honeycomb-like structures. There were cells -the smallest units of life. In fact, it was Hooke who invented the term ""cell"" as the boxlike cells of the cork reminded him of the cells of a monastery . Another achievement of Hooke's was his book Micrographia, which introduced the enormous potential of the microscope. It contains fascinating drawings of the thing he saw under the microscope. The book also includes, among other things, ideas on gravity, light and combustion that may have helped scientists like Newton when they were developing their own theories on these phenomena . Hooke made valuable contributions to astronomy too. A crater on the moon is named after him in honour of his services to this branch of science."	['He liked designing experiments.']

Why are the French very angry when a McDonald's is opening beneath the Louvre?	French people pride themselves on their delicious foods, such as cheese, baguettes and croissants(two kinds of food). In fact, food is an important part of French culture. Families and friends spend hours over the dinner table each night. It is the opposite of the fast-food habit common in other parts of the West. It's the reason why the French are very angry that a McDonald's is opening beneath Paris's most famous museum: the Louvre . The new restaurant will be the 1,142nd McDonald's in France, and will open in the underground approach to the museum. But many French people can't understand why this American chain is opening in the heart of French culture. However, McDonald's is paying no notice to the complaint. McDonald's now has 31,000 chains worldwide. Tourists are hungry, and opening chains in tourist spots pays well. There is another chain threatening France's heritage. This time it is coffee rather than burgers. As more and more Starbucks open in Paris, traditional French cafes are forced to close. The trouble with American companies opening chains throughout the world is the destructive effect they can have on a country's culture. How can a small, independent coffee shop compete with the multi-billion dollar chain? You can go to a Starbucks in any city in the world, but you can only go to a Parisian cafe in France. Responsibility is with the tourists. A McDonald's wouldn't open so near the Louvre if it weren't not going to make money. Similarly, a Pizza Hut wouldn't overlook Egypt's Great Pyramid if no one wants to sit in it. Maybe next time you visit the Great Wall, you should think twice before ordering a Cappuccino in the Starbucks.	['Because they are proud of their own food.']

What can the students do on the computer?	Computers are very popular with students now. It's very easy for them to surf the Internet .Most of them go to the Internet bar and spend more than two hours there. They can do their homework,get some information for their study,download music,and send emails on the computer. But some of them spend too much time playing computer games,and it is bad for their study.	['All of the above']
How was the weather when the author got up?	"This is a true story of how my car got stuck in water and how a stranger helped me during the worst rain storm. Last Sunday, the sky was grey when I woke up. The weather report said rain was coming, but I couldn't stay home just because of rain. Around 8:00 am I had a doctor's appointment. It wasn't raining then. At 9:00 I left the doctor's office to drive to work, and it was raining hard. I just had to go about 5-6 miles down one main road to get to a nearby school, where I could stay until the rain ended. Unfortunately, the road in front of the school was flooded, and my car stopped in the middle. ""Who is going to save me?"" I wondered. I shut off the engine and turned on my flashers . I called 911. They were not helpful. I called my husband, even though he couldn't come and help me. I was also very close to a police station. But I never saw even one police car. I decided to get out of the car, since it was still pouring. My best decision of the day had been to wear rain boots. I took my umbrella and quickly got out and ran across the street to a shelter. Before long, a tow truck happened to pass by the street. The driver kindly offered to help me. At that moment, I really needed car pulled out quickly, so I trusted the stranger. He pulled my car and drove me home. After he had dropped my car off, he also helped me check the engine. He said the engine was most likely flooded, but fortunately there was no water inside the car. Although many years have passed, I still remember that stormy day and the warm-hearted stranger clearly."	['Cloudy.']
According to the passage, it is clear that _ .	"Mountain lions live in mountainous areas of the western prefix = st1 /United States. Lately, however, people have reported seeing them in quiet neighborhoods all across the country! Usually considered shy and seldom seen, these lions are becoming more noticeable. In addition, the lions appear to be moving east. They were even reported in the suburbs of Boston, Philadelphia, andChicago. It seems certain that these ""Kings of the mountains"" are moving. Why? Scientists are not sure. Some think that as the mountain lion population increases in the west, younger wild cats are leaving the area. These cats are searching for new homes and new places for food. ""The young males are looking for new homes,"" says Lynn Sadler, who is the director of the Mountain Lion Foundation in Sacramento,Calif.""People tend to create too many barriers, such as buildings, fences, roads, and noise. As the mountain lions seek new places and food and water sources, these barriers get in their way."" The sightings have made people increasingly watchful . Sometimes the ""mountain lions"" that people report seeing turn out to be large dogs or even house cats. But at least a few of the meetings have been real. The building of new roads, the growing of suburbs and the growing popularity of outdoor activities are all increasing the chances that people in various parts of the country may meet up with a mountain lion. Because many people are concerned about the reappearance of the American lion, an expert outlined some ways they can avoid attracting the wild cats: Never leave pets or pet food outside; properly care for farm animals; and plan public land use to enable the lions to move safely from one place to another. ""To be fair,"" says the expert, ""mountain lions are trying to regain their homes. They were here first. Now we need to find ways we can live together."""

Professor Babette Renneberg believes people feel uneasy in lifts because _ .	"Many of us use them several times a day without really noticing. And yet the way we behave in lifts, or elevators as they are known in the US, reveals a hidden anxiety. Passengers seem to know instinctively how to arrange themselves in an elevator, like the dots on a die. With each additional passenger, the bodies shift, going into the open spaces. On your own, you can do whatever you want--it's your own little box. If there are two of you, you take different corners, creating the greatest distance. When a third person enters, you will unconsciously form a triangle. And when there is a square, with someone in every corner, a fifth person is probable going to have to stand in the middle. Why are we so awkward in lifts? ""You don't have enough space,"" says Professor Babette Renneberg, a clinical psychologist at the Free University of Berlin. ""Usually when we meet other people we have about an arm's length of distance between us. And that's not possible in most elevators, so it's a very unusual setting. It's unnatural."" But perhaps there is more to it than just social awkwardness. ""In the back of our minds we are a little anxious,"" says Nick White, an officer in New York who was unfortunate enough to be trapped in a lift for 41 hours. ""We don't like to be locked into a place. We want to get out of the elevator as soon as possible, you know, it's a frightening place to be."" During his terrible experience, he began to think of another enclosed space--a tomb. Dr. Lee Gray agrees that a sense of powerlessness is the main cause of lift anxiety. ""You're in a machine that's moving, over which you have no control. You cannot see the elevator engine, you don't know how it's working."" he says."	['they have to stay too close together']
From this passage, the author tells us that _ .	"The story began with a young mother who had three sons. Unfortunately, the youngest son developed slow thinking skills, not having the intelligence of his brothers. With double duty as the mother of the household, she was exhausted, so that the youngest was often the target of anger and annoyance. Bad words, such as ""you little fool"" and the like, served as a daily meal for the youngest. The words and curses he got from the mother and ridicule from friends convinced him that he was distressing and embarrassing his family. Every morning he woke up with his own face staring from the mirror reflection, he started to say quietly and sadly, ""The fool is going to school."" As adult citizens, there was compulsory military service which should be lived. Thus, the youngest son also signed up and started to follow the various tests: a medical, physical ability test and other tests. On the day of the announcement, he was called into the board of examiners. In his mind, he convinced himself that he was the fool and couldn't pass the tests this time as he entered the room with his head down. It was not expected at all. The tests turned out to have the highest praise from the board of examiners. ""Congratulations, young man! Your test results are incredible! You are really a great and talented young man. ""Words from the board of examiners became the discovery of a new side of himself that was not known in advance. Voice kept echoing in his mind, such as ""I, the great man, am in the shower"", ""The great man washes his face"", ""The talented young man again brushes his teeth"" and so on. Confidence and improved self-image came beyond usual. 20 years later, the youngest established himself as a successful businessman who was admired and respected, and received many awards. The mindset and belief are the power behind the success that is within us. Whatever we think and believe in or minds continuously, it will eventually materialize in reality. That's the universally applicable law."	['think big and you will get big results']
What is the best title for the passage?	"Chinese people call the Spring Festival""Nian"". But do you know that Nian was once the name of a monster ? A long time ago, the monster Nian lived in the mountains. It ate animals. But in winter, it could not find food. So it came to villages and ate a lot of people. People were so afraid of Nian that they locked their doors before evening came during the winter. One day, an old man came to a village. He told people there that Nian was afraid of three things----the color red, fire and noise. He told people to play drums and gongs, make big fires and set off fireworks to make Nian go away. On a moonless, cold night, Nian went to the village again. As soon as it opened its big mouth, people made loud noises and made fires. Nian was really afraid and ran away. wherever it went, there was noise and fire. When Nian was tired and could not run anymore, people killed the monster. After that, on the coldest day of winter, people beat drums and gongs, and set off fireworks to celebrate the death of the monster of Nian. They put up red lanterns and have a big dinner without sleeping during the night. In the morning people greet each other happily. So now we have the Spring Festival."	['How the Spring Festival Came']
Alfred tried to do the following EXCEPT _ .	I'm Alfred. I was born with a problem in my backbone and mobility was a big challenge for me, but thanks to my teachers and friends, my school life was excellent. My friends and I used to sit together and have lots of fun. Whenever we got a free period, we used to start shouting or play games. I took part in all competitions, such as poetry writing, story writing, painting and all activities on Teachers' Day or somebody's birthday and had much fun. My English teacher was very tall. The moment she entered the class, we would all sit quietly and open the books. She would encourage me by giving me important assignments and also morning news to read during the assembly. She would come down and listen to my English debate , which made me take part in all debate competitions. The same was true of my biology and science teacher. She was very nice and sweet. She would always give me extra information on the biology project. I could not go to the lab for experiments, so she would bring the lab down and help me with the biology and science experiments and would give me excellent marks. My friends made me monitor and the naughty boys listened to me. My friends used to help me with my notes when I was absent . My teachers always gave me important project work and I felt proud when they _ after I finished it quickly and correctly. I was never shouted at or made fun of or scolded by any of my friends and teachers. Today I often see the terrible punishments given to students on TVs. I feel very sad. I really want to express my love and thanks to all my wonderful teachers and friends, without them my school life would not have been so excellent and unforgettable.

Which of the following is the most important thing that the writer has learned from his father?	"My father woke me up early one summer morning when I was fourteen and announced: ""Get up. You're going with me to cut grass."" The idea that my father thought I was old enough to help him in his business made me feel proud and excited. From sunup to sundown, my father, my younger brother and I worked in the large yards in a rich part of Atlanta, Georgia. By the end of the day I was tired out, but I felt good. I had put in a hard day's labor and had earned $ 6 One day my father found some leaves I'd missed and pulled me aside. ""Clear away these leaves!"" he said firmly, ""and don't make me have to do it again."" The message was clear. Today I value the importance of doing a job right the first time. It will never fail to impress the person you are working for. After two years, my father told me and my brother that he felt we were old enough to do lawns on our own. Every Saturday during our last two years of high school, we set out early in the morning with the same desire and drive we had gained while working under our father. Taking care of lawns was not exciting or high-paying, but that didn't matter. It taught me that any job was a good job and that whatever I was paid was more than I had before. A newspaper reporter once asked me how someone could possibly live on a forty-hour-a-week minimum pay. ""My father has never worked just forty hours a week, and neither have I,"" I replied. ""If you're only working forty hours, you probably don't want to do any better than you are doing."" In every job I've held from doing lawns to washing dishes, I have learned something that helped me in my next job. If you work hard enough, you can learn from any job you do."

What is the author's chief concern about the increasing use of City Bikes?	"New Yorkers are gradually getting used to more bicyclers on those hot blue City Bikes.But what about local bike shops? Is City Bike rolling up riders at their expense? At Gotham Bikes in Tribeca,manager W.Ben said the shop has seen an increase in its overall sales due to the bike-share program.""It's getting more people on the road,""he said.James Ryan,an employee at Danny's Cycles,said City Bike is a good option for people to ease in a city famous for its traffic jams.""They can try out a bike without buying one.""he said. Rentals are not a big part of the business at either Gotham Bikes or Danny's Cycles.But for Frank's Bike Shop,a small business on Christopher St.,the bike--share program has been bad news.Owner Frank Arroyo said his rental business has decreased by 90% since City Bike was rolled out last month.Arroyo's main rental customers are European tourists,who have since been drawn away by City Bikes. However,Ben said the bike--share is good for bike sales at his shop.""People have used the bike--share and realized how great it is to bike in the city,then decide that they want something Dicer for themselves,""he noted.Andrew Crooks,owner of NYC Velo,at 64 Second Ave.,said at first he Was concerned about bike--share,though,he admitted,""I was happy to see people on bikes.It seemed like a great idea,but one that would be difficult to implement .""Crooks said he worried about inexperienced riders' lack of awareness of biking rules and strong negative reaction from non--cyclists.However,he said.it's still too early to tell if his business has been impacted.While it's possible that bike--share will cause a drop in business,Crooks thought that the idea was a positive step forward for New York City."

The passage intends to tell us that we should _ .	"I have a younger brother. To me , he is a fourteen-year-old kid named Joe, with blond hair and blue eyes. To others, he is different. Where I see a kid who just needs a lot more attention, others see a mentally disabled boy, a kid who cannot walk or talk or think for himself. I see someone who just makes daily routine a bit less routine. Others see an annoyance, a bother. This is not to say that I have never felt resentful toward Joe. He is my brother, and with that comes responsibility. ""Gina, could you stay in tonight and watch your brother?"" ""Gina, do me a favor and feed him dinner and change his diaper later, please?""""Could you come home right after school today and get Joe off the bus?"" These are phrases that I have heard since I was twelve. And sure, they have made me resent my brother to a certain extent. I would think: that's not fair! Everyone else can stay after and be a member of this club, or get extra help from that teacher. Or, all my friends are going out tonight, why can't I? And, how come I have to feed him? He is not my son! However, the small amount of resentment I feel toward my brother is erased a thousand times over by what I have learned from him. Besides making me responsible from a young age, and helping me be more accepting of all kinds of people, he has taught me to be thankful for what I have. I know that there are moment in my life that I should cherish and that Joe will never experience. He will never laugh so hard that he cries. He will never feel the glory of a straight-A report card. He will never comfort a best friend crying on his shoulder. And he will never know how much his family love him. Because he will never know, it is up to me to know, every second , how lucky I am. It is up to me to realize that life should be lived to its fullest, and that you should always, always be grateful that God, or whoever are the powers that be, gave you the ability to live your life the way you were meant to live it."

What can we infer from this passage?	"ELMONT, N. Y.

Which of the following best describes the author's viewpoint?	"Things are seldom what they seem.Skim milk masquerades as cream.Anil labor-saving household appliances often do not save labor.This is the surprising conclusion reached by a small army of historians, sociologists, and home economists who have undertaken, in recent years, to study the one form of work that has turned out to be most resistant to inquiry and analysis -?namely, housework. During the first half of the twentieth century, the average American household was transformed by the introduction of a group of machines that profoundly altered the daily lives of housewives.The forty years between 1920 and 1960 witnessed what might be called the ""industrial revolution in the home"".Where once there had been a wood or coal burning stove there now was a gas or electric range.The dryer replaced the clothes-line; the vacuum cleaner replaced the broom; the refrigerator replaced the icebox and the root cellar.No one had to chop wood any more. And yet American housewives in 1960, 1970, 1980 and even 1990 continued to log about the same number of hours at their work as their grandmothers and mothers had in 1910, 1920 and 1930.The earliest time studies of housewives date from the very same period in which time studies of other workers were becoming popular--the first three decades of the twentieth century.The sample sizes of these studies were usually quite small, and they did not always define housework in precisely the same way.but their results were more or less consistent; whether rural or urban, the average American housewife performed fifty to sixty hours of unpaid work in her home every week, and the only variable that significantly altered _ was the number of small children. A half-century later not much has changed.Survey research has become much more sophisticated, and sample sizes have grown considerably, but the results of the time remain consistent.The average American housewife, now armed with dozens of motors and thousands of electronic chips, still spends fifty to sixty hours a week doing housework The only variable that significantly altered the size of that number was frill-time employment in the labor force: ""working"" housewives cut down the average number of hours that they spend cooking and cleaning, shopping and chauffeuring, to a not insignificant thirty-five, virtually the equivalent of another full-time job."

Who would get father's fortune?	"Long long ago, there was an old merchant who had three sons. ""To which one shall I leave my fortune?"" he wondered. ""It must be to the cleverest son. But which one is the cleverest?"" He called his three sons to him. ""Here is some money,"" he told them, ""you must each take one coin to buy something that will fill this room. Anyone who can do this shall have my fortune."" ""It is a big room,"" said the eldest son. ""One coin will not buy very much,"" said the second son. But the youngest son said nothing. He stood and thought, and then he smiled, ""Come, brothers,"" he said, ""let us go to the market."" The eldest son bought straw with his coin. But one coin bought only a bit of straw. Even when he had spread it as much as he could, the straw covered only a corner of the room. The second son bought sand with his coin. But one coin bought only a bit of sand. Even when he had spread it as much as he could, the sand covered only half of the floor. ""What did you buy?"" the eldest son angrily asked the youngest son. ""You don't have any straw."" ""Yes, what did you buy?"" the second son asked angrily. ""You don't have any sand."" ""I bought this,"" said the youngest son. ""A candle!"" cried his brothers. ""What good is a candle?"" ""Watch"", said the youngest son. He lit the candle, and all at once the room was filled from wall to wall, from ceiling to floor. It was filled with light! ""Although you are the youngest, you are indeed the cleverest of my sons,"" the old merchant said. And that is how, the old merchant left his fortune to his youngest son, the one who could fill a room with light."	['The cleverest son.']
What is the best title of the passage?	"Children with autism have difficulty with social skills and communication. They often behave in restricted and repetitive ways and have what seem like abnormally intense interests. Autism is more common in boys than girls. What causes it is not clear. Scientists are studying genes and possible environmental influences. Doctors usually cannot confirm a diagnosis of autism until a child is about three years old. Rebecca Landa is a researcher at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Maryland. Professor Landa wanted to find out what differences in development might be seen earlier. She led a new study that observed 235 babies between six and 36 months of age. ""At six months of age, the signs of some risk for developing communication and social delays, including autism, include motor delays. Like when you lay your baby on their back and you pull them by the arms gently into a seated position, the baby's head may nod back behind the shoulders, like poor head control. So that does not mean that the baby is going to have autism, but it does mean the baby needs to have some exercises to strengthen their body. And when they strengthen their body, they are better able to play with toys and engage with people, which then goes on to help them have better outcomes."" By the time a baby is one year old, signs of possible autism include difficulty in using words and not looking eye-to-eye or reaching out to other people. By 14 months, the baby might smile less and use language less. However, Professor Landa says these signs can be so small that they might be missed during a short health exam. ""It's important for parents to stay tuned into their children's development, and if a parent is concerned about a child's development, for professionals to listen to them."" The earlier parents notice delays, she says, the sooner they can begin doing simple things that may help improve their child's development. For example: talking to the child about what they are doing, commenting when the child shows them something, and playing simple games that keep the child's attention."

"Western people usually use ""cat"" to refer to "" _ ""."	"As we know, there are differences between western culture and Chinese culture. We can see differences when we pay attention to the way words are used. Let's look at the words about animals and plants. Most expressions in Chinese about the dog, for example, ""a homeless dog"", ""a mad dog"", ""a running dog"" and ""a dog catching a mouse"", have negative meanings. But in western countries, dogs are thought to be honest and good friends of humans. In English, people use the dog to describe positive actions. For example, ""you are a lucky dog"" means you are a lucky person. And ""every dog has its day"" means each person has good luck sometimes. To describe a person's serious illness, they say ""sick as a dog"". The word ""dog-tired"" means very tired. However, Chinese love cats very much. But in western culture, ""cat"" is often used to describe a woman who is cruel. There are many other examples of how ""cat"" is used differently as well. The rose is regarded as a symbol of love in both China and some western countries. People think the rose stands for love, peace, courage and friendship. And the rose is the national flower of England, America and many other countries. The words about plants and animals are used in positive or negative ways in different cultures. We can learn about many differences in cultures by comparing how some words are used."	['an unkind woman']
The author of the text mainly _ .	"Your House Will Take Care of You In Old Age Have you ever thought what your life would be like in old age? Everyone talks about the ""aging"" society with large numbers of elderly people needing home care. Now German researchers have set up a ""smart""house, programmed to help the elderly live at home with dignity. Scientists at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute say the house combines existing technology with future-oriented technology. For example, the ""smart""bathroom has a touch screen mirror that can remind people to take their medicine, wash their hands or brush their teeth. The hardware behind Fraunhofer's electronic bathroom is not new, and the software runs on a regular personal computer. When the medicine cabinet is opened, a display in the middle of the mirror tells the person how many pills to take. The mirror is linked to a care provider, who can remotely check whether a patient at home is actually taking medicine and brushing his or her teeth. As many elderly people have arthritic conditions that make it difficult to operate water taps, the mirror also has displays that turn the water tap on or off or control the water temperature. The bathroom is only the start. Kitchens, bedrooms and all other parts of the intelligent""home will become ""user-friendly""to meet all kinds of individual needs. Sensors in doors, toilets, taps, light switches and carpets detect every activity and record them electronically. Doctors or care staff can see from the computer records what personal hygiene tasks have been completed, how often the elderly person visits the bathroom or uses the toilet. In case of an emergency, the computer automatically alerts the chosen contact person or calls the care center."	['introduces a new house']
Who helped the writer find the subway station?	"A trip to London My family had dreamed of a trip to London for a long time.Luckily it was possible for us to realize our dream because all of us were free on the weekend. We planned to drive into Cambridge and caught the 7:34train to Liverpool Street Station.Then my wife and I would separate from Joan,my wife's sister,to do different things and finally meet again for lunch.And after lunch,we would go to the concert. But we were late because of a thick London fog.The train had to move along so slowly that it was not until 10:30that it got there.In spite of our late arrival,Joan decided that she would go to see the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London while we went shopping.It was only after her sister had disappeared into the fog that my wife realized that we hadn't decided where we should meet for lunch.Since I had our three tickets for the concert in my pocket,this was indeed a problem.We didn't have any mobile phones at that time.There seemed to be nothing we could do except taking a taxi to the Tower of London,and try to find her there.Needless to say,we didn't find her. It was now one o'clock,and the concert began at 2:30.""Perhaps she will think of waiting outside the concert hall,""said my wife hopefully.By this time the fog was so thick that road traffic had to stop,and the only way to get there was by subway.Hand in hand we felt our way along the road to where we thought the nearest station should be.An hour later we were still trying to find it.Just when I was about to become angry,we met a blind man tapping his way confidently through the fog.With his help we found the subway station which was just fifty meters down the road. By now it was far too late to get to the concert hall before the performance began at 2:30,so we decided to return to Cambridge.It took seven hours instead of the usual two to make that journey.Nor were we able to get any food and drink on the train.We were tired and hungry. We finally reached home at ten.Opening the door we were amazed to find Joan at home; she had seen the Crown Jewels,had managed to get another ticket for concert,and had had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant.Of course,she managed to get home,too.Oh my god!"

The clothes people choose to wear tell us about their _ .	In Britain today, is it possible to tell a person's class just by looking at him? Physical details alone tell us about health, diet and the type of work a person does. A hundred years ago the working class often looked unhealthy, small and they were either too thin or too fat. The upper classes were often tall, sporting types who were used to a good diet and looked healthy. Today living and working conditions have improved, and such descriptions are no longer true. People are taller now than a hundred years ago. Everyone in Britain today is able to have free medicine, a good diet, acceptable working conditions and enough rest and leisure. WWW.K**S*858$$U.COM The clothes people choose to wear, however, do provide information about their backgrounds. Expensive clothes look expensive and show their wearer is rich. Clothes can provide other clues as well. The upper classes appear to be less interested in fashion and wear good quality clothes in non-bright colours, made of natural material like wool, leather and cotton. Lower working-class people often choose clothes in bright colours, made of man-made materials. A sociological explanation for this would be that colour and interest are missing from their lives, and therefore any opportunity to produce this is taken. Clothes are available at a price within most people's reach. New clothes make the wearer feel good and show some degree of wealth to the outside world. Today it is the younger people who spend most money on clothes. Fashion is no longer for the upper classes and the rich. Young people from all social classes spend a lot of money on clothes. Some new fashions are started by working-class people who want to look different and feel important. They want people WWW.K**S*858$$U.COMto look at them.	['backgrounds']
The museum in Hawaii was _ and not _ .	Mary had a nice summer vacation last year. She went to Hawaii in July. Mary likes fruits, and the Hawaiian bananas and oranges were great.

What can we learn about Uncle Tom in the book?	The novelist, Harriet Beecher Stowe, born 200 years ago, was a poor housewife with six children, and she suffered from various illnesses. Driven by the hatred of slavery, she found time to write Uncle Tom's Cabin, which became the most influential novel in American history and caused great change, both at home and abroad. Today, however, the book has a different reputation, owing to the popular image of its character, Uncle Tom, whose name has become a saying for a cowardly black man who betrays his race. But this view is wrong: the original Uncle Tom was physically and morally strong, an inspiration for black people and other oppressed people worldwide. Indeed, that was why, in the mid-19th century, Southerners attacked Uncle Tom's Cabin as a dangerously destructive book, while Northern reformers--especially black people--often praised it. The book was influential overseas too. In Russia it inspired Vladimir Lenin, who recalled it as his favorite book in childhood. It was the first American novel to be translated and published in China, and it fueled anti-slavery movements in Cuba and Brazil. The book's progressive appeal was the character of Uncle Tom himself: a strong man who is notable because he does not betray his race; one reason he gives up escaping from his plantation is that he doesn't want to put his fellow slaves in danger. And he is finally killed because he refuses to tell his master where two runaway slaves are hiding. Unfortunately, these themes were lost in many of the stage versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin. The play, seen by more people than those who read the book, remained popular up to the 1950s and still appears occasionally. But in the play, Stowe's revolutionary themes were drowned. But it doesn't have to be that way; indeed; during the civil rights era it was those who most closely resembled Uncle Tom--Stowe's Uncle Tom, not the embarrassed one of popular myth--that proved most effective in promoting progress. Both Stowe and Uncle Tom deserve our reconsideration and our respect.	['he helps his fellow slaves to avoid getting into danger.']
What can we infer from the passage?	"Carrie had had enough. She placed a note on the kitchen table, picked up her bags, and then made her way to the bus stop. ""Hi, mum,"" she said after arriving at her house. ""What have you done?"" she asked, noticing Carrie's luggage in the hallway. ""Oh, mum, I've left him. I couldn't bear any more."" Shocked, her mum didn't know what to say, so she went to make some coffee. Next day, Carrie had a visitor. ""Carrie, please don't do this to me. Come back home?"" Tom begged. But was she listening? She ignored him and stepped back inside the house. The weeks went by and Tom became very depressed. There seemed little point in carrying on without her. Then one night he got into his car and drove to a nearby seaside town. After abandoning the car, he walked towards a big stone by the sea. Looking over the edge he saw the waves crashing into the bottom of the rock. His body was shaking -- then he jumped. Carrie was mad when she found out. She paced up and down smoking a cigarette. Her eyes were full of tears. It wasn't all his fault that he had become so bad tempered. He had been finding it difficult looking for another job. She then threw the cigarette to the ground, wiped away the tears and made her way up the long passage and into a room. ""Don't you ever, ever do anything like that again,""she said in a temper to the person in the room. ""I won't,""Tom said, looking up at her from his hospital bed. Luckily for him, someone had seen him jump and dived in to save him."	['Tom finally got forgiveness from Carrie.']
The example of wine is used to illustrate that _ .	The traditional distinction between products that satisfy needs and those satisfy wants is no longer adequate to describe classes of products. In today's prosperous societies, the distinction has become unclear because so many wants have been turned into needs.A writer, for instance, can work with paper and pencils. These are legal needs for the task.But the work can be done more quickly and efficiently with a word processor. Thus a computer is soon viewed as a need rather than a want. In the field of marketing, consumer goods are classed according to the way in which they are purchased.The two main classes are convenience goods and shopping goods.Two lesser types are specialty goods and unsought goods. It must be emphasized that all of these types are based on the way shoppers think about products, not on the nature of the products themselves. What is regarded as a convenience item in France(wine,for example)should be a specialty goods in the United States. People do not spend a great deal of time shopping for such convenience items as groceries, newspapers, toothpaste, aspirin, and candy. The buying of convenience goods may be done routinely, as some families buy groceries once a week. Such regularly purchased items are called staples. Sometimes convenience products are bought without enough thinking; someone has a sudden desire for an ice cream sundae on a hot day. Or they may be purchased as emergency items. Shopping goods are items for which customers search. They compare prices. quality, and styles, and may visit a number of stores before making a decision.Buying an automobile is often done this way. Shopping goods fail into two classes:those that are recognized as basically the same and those that are regarded as different. Items that are looked upon as basically the same include such things as home appliances, television sets, and automobiles.Having decided on the model desired, the customer is primarily interested in getting the item at the most favorable price. Items regarded as essentially different include clothing, furniture, and dishes. Quality, style and fashion will either take precedence over price, or they win not matter at all.	['the type of a product is determined by its consumers']
What does the passage mainly tell us?	Celebrities have become a powerful influence on some people because of their social position and their economic situation. First, some people admire and imitate stars because they allow themselves to be influenced by the media. Television, radio, and magazines invade the lives of audience with a variety of shows, information, and publications about stars and their lives. For instance, Britney Spears has become the target of paparazzi . In May, Britney appeared at the front page of the most popular magazines revealing that she married her best friend in Vegas, Nevada. Media also invade stars' lives because reporters know they can get high profits from readers who buy and follow their favorite artists' news. Second, some mad audiences imitate their celebrities for their lack of confidence. Some people who are shy and lack personality may find that imitating others will cause a good impression. For example, my cousin Jenny, who lacks a social life because of her introverted personality, believes that acting and dressing like Jennifer Lopez will make her popular in high school. Finally, several fans of stars imitate them because of peer pressure. Since my niece's girl friends formed an Antonio Banderas' fan club, she had also joined the group. Although she wasn't a huge fan of his, now she collects most of Banderas' possessions. In fact, when I asked Arianna, my niece, why she was part of Banderas' fan club, she replied with a doubtful tone that she did not wish to be rejected by the other teens. In conclusion, it is true that celebrities play spectacular roles in their performances in Hollywood, which entertains many people all over the world; however, modern celebrities influence the audience to the point where their fans admire and try to imitate their lives.

Where do today's children see Donald Duck cartoons?	"In 1933 an unknown American called Clarence Nash went to see the film-maker Walter Disney. He had an unusual voice and he wanted to work in Disney's cartoon film for children. When Walter Disney heard Nash's voice, he said, ""Stop! That's our duck!"" The duck was the now-famous Donald Duck, who first appeared in 1934 in the film, The Wise Little Hen. Donald lived in an old houseboat and worn his sailor jacket and hat. Later that year he became a star after an eight minute Mickey Mouse film. The cinema audiences liked him because he was lazy and greedy, and because he lost his temper very easily. And they loved his voice when he became angry with Mickey's eight nephews. Soon Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse himself, probably because he wasn't a goody-goody, like Mickey. In the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, Donald and his friends Mickey, Goofy and Pluto made hundreds of Disney cartoons. He also made educational film about the place of the USA in the world, and safety in the home. Then in 1966 Donald Duck and his voice disappeared--there were no more new cartoons. Clarence Nash died in February, 1985. But today's Children can still see the old cartoons on the television and hear that famous voice."	['On television.']
What's the best title of the passage?	"A woman saw three old men with long white beards sitting in her front yard, hungry. She did not know them but invited them in. ""We do not go into a house together,"" they replied. And she asked why. One of the old men explained: ""His name is Wealth,"" pointing to one of his friends, ""and he is Success, and I am Love."" Then he added, ""Now go in and discuss with your husband which one of us you want in your home."" The woman went in and told her husband what had happened. Her husband was overjoyed. ""How nice!"" he said. ""Since that is the case, let Wealth come in and fill our home with wealth!"" His wife disagreed, ""My dear, why not invite Success?"" Their daughter-in-law gave her own suggestion: ""Wouldn't it be better to invite Love? Our home will be filled with love then."" ""Let's _ our daughter-in-law's advice,"" said the husband to his wife. ""Go out and invite Love to be our guest."" Love got up and started walking toward the house. The other two also got up and followed him. Surprised, the woman asked Wealth and Success, ""I only invited Love, why are you coming in?"" The old men replied together. ""If you had invited Wealth or Success, the other two of us would have stayed out. But since you invited Love, wherever he goes, we go with him. Wherever there is Love, there is also Wealth and Success!"""	['Wealth, success and love.']
.The following aspects of the training help increase intelligence EXCEPT _ .	"A new study has found that it may be possible to train people to be more intelligent, increasing the brainpower they had at birth. Until now,it has been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience--what psychologists call fluid intelligence--is innate and cannot be taught(though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing). But in the new study,researchers describe a method for improving this skill,along with experiments to prove it works. The key, researchers found, was carefully structured training in working memory--the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it.This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence,so the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence. First they measured fluid intelligence of volunteers using standard tests.Then they trained each in a complicated memory task--the child's card game,in which they had to recall a card they saw and heard.During the course, they needed to ignore irrelevant items, monitor ongoing performance,manage two tasks at the same time and connect related items to one another in space and time. The four groups experienced a half-hour of training daily for 8, 12, 17 and 19 days, respectively.To make sure they were not just improving their test-taking skills,the researchers compared them with control groups that took the tests without the training. The results, published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,were striking.Improvement in the trained groups was a lot greater.Moreover,the longer they trained, the higher their scores were.All performers,from the weakest to the strongest,showed significant improvement. ""Our results show you can increase your intelligence with proper training."" said Dr Jaeggi, a co-author of the paper.""No one knows how long the gains will last after training stops,"" he added, ""and the experiment's design did not allow the researchers to determine whether more training would continue to produce further gains."""

Can we use every ATM to withdraw our money in a certain card?	"Nowadays we can see ATMs everywhere. So we'd better learn how to use an ATM to withdraw money. First, we must find an ATM for your cards. Some ATMs can only work with certain bank's cards. But now more and more ATMs can use all the banks' cards. Second, we can put our cards in a slot on the right side of the machine. Make sure the card is facing the right way. Then , when the screen says, ""Please enter your PIN,"" we can press the numbers. After that, we can select the type of transaction .So we can press the key for withdrawing money. Next, we can put in the amount of money we want to withdraw by pressing the numbers. Then the screen may say, ""Please wait"". After a short while, we can take our money from the slot at the bottom of the machine. At last, if we don't need other services, we can press the key for ending. Then our cards will come out from the slot we put it in. And we can finish our dealing and take the cards and money away."

We learn from the text that biofilms _ .	"Scientists from England's Newcastle University have discovered that bacteria have the ability to detect smells, according to a study by the university on Sunday. The team of scientists, led by Dr. Reindert Nijland, discovered that bacteria can detect certain types of smell- producing chemicals, including ammonia that is produced by other bacteria. Once they sense the smells from other kinds of bacteria, the bacteria will gather together to form a colony and form a layer of slime in order to force the competitors out of their area. The response decreases as the distance between the two bacterial colonies increases. That slime, also known as biofilm, is one of the primary causes of infection on many medical implants . Biofilms also slow down ships and are believed to cost the marine industry millions of dollars annually. However, they can also be used to clean up spilled oil floating on the sea, as they grow strong on it. ""This is the first evidence of a bacterial 'nose'able to detect potential competitors,"" Dr. Nijland said in the August 15 statement, which confirms that bacteria possess qualities similar to four of the five senses that humans enjoy (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell), the others being touch, taste, and sight. ""The fact that bacteria formed slime when exposed to ammonia has important significance for understanding how biofilms are formed and how we might be able to use them to our advantage,"" he added. Their findings were published in Sunday's edition of biotechnology journal, and could change the way scientists look at how each of the senses developed over time. ""It was thought for a long time that smell existed only in complex living creatures,"" Dr. Nijland said. ""Now we see that bacteria are able to do the same, so the indication is that the ability may have developed even earlier."""	['can be used to benefit humans']
What can we learn about the arctic fox's diet?	The Arctic Fox Characteristics The arctic fox is dark gray to bluish brown in the summer. In the winter its fur is white or creamy white. It has a long bushy tail, a short nose and small, curled back ears. It has short legs and thick fur. Its short legs and nose, thick fur and small ears are adaptions that help it survive in cold climates. Because its legs are so short and its ears and nose are small, they are less exposed to the cold. The arctic fox also has thick fur and hair on its paw pads that help keep it warm. When the arctic fox is sleeping, it protects its nose from the cold by curling its bushy tail around its body. The arctic fox is about three feet long and weighs between five and fifteen pounds. Males are larger than females. Diet The arctic fox is an opportunities eater. It will eat just about whatever it comes across. It eats small mammals like lemmings and it also eats birds, insects and eggs. In fact, in the winter it often follows polar bears and wolves and eats their leftover kill. In the summer the arctic fox will carry extra food to its den and store it under rocks to eat later. The arctic fox sometimes even makes its own freezer by digging a hole in the permafrost and storing its food there. A major source of food for the arctic fox is the lemming. In fact, the arctic fox population often peaks every four years in a cycle that follows lemming population changes. Life Cycle The arctic fox mates between February and June. The female builds a new den and gives birth to between six and twelve dark--furred kits. Both the female and the male will take care of the young kits. The male will guard the den and bring food to the den for the mother and the kits. The kits are weaned when they are between two and four weeks old and then they will start to leave the den.

If you register your cell phone number with ID information, _ .	"If you want to get a new cell phone number, don't forget to bring your ID with you . As of September 1, people have to register with their ID to buy a new cell phone number. You can show your ID card orhukou, but student ID's won't work. If you already have a cell phone number, it is better to register it before 2013. The new rules are meant to prevent junk messages and fraud through cell phones. A cell phone user in China on average received 43.3 messages a week in the first half of this year. According to reports, about 12 of those were junk messages. In a survey, about 74.5 percent of users said they have received fraudulent messages. If all people register their cell phone number with ID information, it will be easier for police to find the people behind those messages. Situations in other countries Because cell phone are getting more and more popular, many countries have made stricter cell phone rules. Countries like India, Japan, Australia, and Singapore all ask users to register their ID information. Ulrich Mller is a German living in Beijing. ""In Germany, you have to show your ID when you buy a cell phone card,"" he said. ""The rules have been there for a long time. Most people know about it."" Linda van der Horst is a student at Peking University. She said that in the Netherlands ,people have to show ID information and bank account information to buy a cell phone card."

We can infer from the article that _ .	"When a big exam is coming up, you probably feel anxious about any wasted time and want to begin school as soon as you probably can. But tens of thousands of British high school students will soon be getting up later. They're taking part in a new experiment by Oxford University to see if later classes can improve their exam results. Grades 10 students in the UK have to take the nationwide General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams. They have to pass these exams in order to study more advanced courses, and later apply for universities. The Oxford University project means that GCSE students from more than 100 schools across England will start school at 10 am, more than one hour later than the current start time (8:50 am). The project is based on scientific evidence that teenagers are ""out of sync "" with traditional school hours, the Telegraph reported. And what they need is more sleep in the morning. ""We know that something funny happens when you're a teenager, in that you seem to be out of sync with the world,"" said professor Colin Epsie, who is leading the study. ""Your parents think it's because you are lazy and opinionated and everything will be OK if you could get to sleep earlier. But science is telling us that teenagers need to sleep more in the mornings."" Everyone follows a natural cycle of sleep and wakefulne ss. Biology has decided that teenagers go to sleep around midnight and don't feel fully awake until 9-10 am, according to scientists. That's two hours later than adults. And their body clocks stay like this until the age of around 21 for males, and 19 for females. ""Society provides school for learning, but the brain provides sleep. So we are exploring the possibility that if you delay the schools start time until 10 am, that will improve learning performance,"" said Epsie. The results could be positive, based on previous studies. An early study at the UK's Monkseaton High School in 2009 found that starting an hour later improved grades in core subjects by 19 percent. The Oxford project is expecting to publish the results in 2018. It's time to wait and see whether scientists will give us an excuse to get up late."

This passage is most probably taken from.	New Zealand Education Compulsory Education Compulsory education starts at age 5 and ends at age 16. Class Size The number of students in a class is 30 students. Classrooms Students from Years 5-8 stay in the same classroom for most subjects and move to other classrooms only for specific subjects. In Year 9, students take some courses With their homeroom class and some _ classes with students from different classes. Starting from Year 10, students no longer stay in the same classroom most of the time. They go to different classes according to their own choices and abilities. Term Dates A school year starts in January and ends in December. There are four terms in a year. Each term is about 10 weeks. Class Schedule School starts at around 8:30 and ends at 15:15. There are only five periods a day and a period is about an hour long. In the morning, around 10:30, there will be a 20-minute break when students usually have some snacks during this time. There is a lunch period at around 12:40 for about an hour. Teachers Teachers have to teach students of different year level at the same time. Most teachers teach students from at least three to four different year levels. Besides, quite a number of teachers teach more than one subject. This is because the fact that many courses are optional.	['an educational book']

Between 40 and 50 of the dolphins appeared in the busy port on Tuesday morning,obviously drawn by the fishrich waters of Haifa Harbor. However,the bay is also full of harmful chemicals. Aviad Sheinin,professor of Haifa University's Maritime Studies Department,said he didn't think the dolphins were harmed by the pollution,but he hoped that they would swim back to the sea soon. ""It seems that they are quite relaxed. They don't seem to be stressed,"" he said. Haifa Harbor is lined by chemical companies that have been pouring poisonous waste into the water for decades. While pollution levels have dropped in recent years,the water is still considered a health hazard. ""There are lots of fish in Haifa Harbor. Unfortunately we couldn't tell the dolphins that the fish are not healthy;and I don't know what the result will be,"" he told Israel Army Radio.Hundreds of Haifa residents gathered around Haifa Harbor to see the interesting sight,and researchers said this provided a rare chance to film and study the roughtoothed dolphins. In addition to the dozens of dolphins which swam into the port on Tuesday,a similar number stayed outside the breakwater .Later Tuesday the dolphins left the port but remained near the entrance and Israel's coast guard was patrolling the area to try to make sure the dolphins didn't reenter the poisonous waters. Relatively little is known about roughtoothed dolphins,which are usually found in deep and warm tropical waters."	['he is uncertain about what will happen to the dolphins']
To study English well, we have to _ .	"It's over three years since I began to learn English. I'm glad that I am getting on well with it. I find English quite difficult, but very interesting. When I first started, I thought I had only to remember the new words and learn some grammar I knew little about English idioms .I thought each English word had the same meaning in Chinese. When I learn to say""I see a book on the desk,"" I thought the English word ""see "" was just like the Chinese word "" kan "",So one day when my teacher asked me,"" what are you doing?"", I answered, ""I'm seeing a book."" ""That's wrong ."" the teacher said, ""you don't see a book, You read a book. You can't use English word like a Chinese one.. Be sure not to make the same mistake again."" After that I began to pay more attention to the differences between Chinese and English. For example, in English we say a"" high mountain"", but a"" tall man. "" In Chinese we use the same word ""gao "" for both.. Again in English we say"" take part in the sports meeting "", "" attend the meeting "" and"" join the army,"" while in Chinese we can use ""can jia "" for all three. Interesting ,isn't? So to study English doesn't only mean hard wok, it can be great fun, too! We not only have to pay attention to pronunciation, grammar spelling and handwriting, we also have to understand English idioms. We can learn English well only in the way! But all this is only a beginning and I still have a long way to go. I'll try my best and work even harder than before. I must speak and listen to English more both in and out of class. I must learn English well so that I can work well when I grow up."	['do all the above things']

A recent study showed that between 60 and 80percent of runners got hurt per year. This is pretty much more than any other human activity. Researchers say the technology can also be developed to teach people how to dance, play sports such golf, or even to help to teach women to walk better in high heels. Mr. Vigano said, ""People could all benefit from the idea. We have had interest from all sorts of sports, like skiing, football, cycling and golf. Anything where you have to use your feet can use it. It could even be put in high heels to help women walk in them safely."" Socks are just the start, and the technology could be used in gloves, hats and boots.

What aspect of diversity does Valerie Gauthier think is most important?	Picture a typical MBA lecture theatre twenty years ago. In it the majority of students will have conformed to the standard model of the time: male, middle class and Western. Walk into a class today, however, and you'll get a completely different impression. For a start, you will now see plenty more women--the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, boasts that 40% of its new enrolment is female. You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country. It might be tempting, therefore, to think that the old barriers have been broken down and equal opportunity achieved. But, increasingly, this apparent diversity is becoming a mask for a new type of conformity. Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future. Diversity, it seems, has not helped to address fundamental weaknesses in business leadership. So what can be done to create more effective managers of the commercial world? According to Valerie Gauthier, associate dean at HEC Paris, the key lies in the process by which MBA programmes recruit their students. At the moment candidates are selected on a fairly narrow set of criteria such as prior academic and career performance, and analytical and problem solving abilities. This is then coupled to a school's picture of what a diverse class should look like, with the result that passport, ethnic origin and sex can all become influencing factors. But schools rarely dig down to find out what really makes an applicant succeed, to create a class which also contains diversity of attitude and approach--arguably the only diversity that, in a business context, really matters. Professor Gauthier believes schools should not just be selecting candidates from traditional sectors such as banking, consultancy and industry. They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the creative arts, history or philosophy, which will allow them to put business decisions into a wider context. Indeed, there does seem to be a demand for the more rounded leaders such diversity might create. A study by Mannaz, a leadership development company, suggests that, while the bully-boy chief executive of old may not have been eradicated completely, there is a definite shift in emphasis towards less tough styles of management--at least in America and Europe. Perhaps most significant, according to Mannaz, is the increasing interest large companies have in more collaborative management models, such as those prevalent in Scandinavia, which seek to integrate the hard and soft aspects of leadership and encourage delegated responsibility and accountability.

Which of the following applies to the management of human resources in American companies?	If sustainable competitive advantage depends on workforce skills, American firms have a problem. Human-resource management is not traditionally seen as central to the competitive survival of the firm in the United States. Skill acquisition is considered an individual responsibility. Labour is simply another factor of production to be hired--rented at the lowest possible cost--much as one buys materials or equipment. The lack of importance attached to human-resource management can be seen in the corporate management. In an American firm the chief financial officer is almost always second in command. The post of head of human-resource management is usually a specialized job, off at the edge of the corporate hierarchy. The executive who holds it is never consulted on major strategic decisions and has no chance to move up to Chief Executive Officer(CEO). By way of contrast, in Japan the head of human-resource management is central--usually the second most important executive, after the CEO, in the firm's hierarchy. While American firms often talk about the vast amounts spent on training their work force, in fact they invest less in the skills of their employees than do either Japanese or German firms. The money they do invest is also more highly concentrated on professional and managerial employees. And the limited investments that are made in training workers are also much more narrowly focused on the specific skills necessary to do the next job rather than on the basic background skills that make it possible to absorb new technologies. As a result, problems arise when new breakthrough technologies arrive. If American workers, for example, take much longer to learn how to operate new flexible manufacturing stations than workers on Germany (as they do), the effective cost of those stations is lower in Germany than it is in the United States. More time is required before equipment is up and running in production, and the need for extensive retraining generates costs and creates bottlenecks that limit the speed with which new equipment can be used. The result is a slower pace of technological change, and in the end the skills of the bottom half of the population affect the wages of the top half. If the bottom half can't effectively make the processes that have to be operated, the management and professional jobs that go with these processes will disappear.

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	As is known to us, Washington University in St. Louis became the first college in the United States to ban selling bottled water in 2009. Since then, more than a dozen small colleges and schools have done the same. The ban isn't because the schools don't want students to have easy access to water. Instead, the goal is to encourage students to bring reusable bottles to save money and, more importantly, to save the environment. Many people believe that producing and using bottled water not only wastes money but also harms the environment. They say that bottled water is unnecessary because public water supplies in the U.S. are among the best in the world. These people believe that water fountains and reusable bottles with easy access to filling stations are a better choice. But the makers of bottled water argue that plastic bottles make up a small part of the nation's total waste. They say it's unfair to single out their product when so many other items are packaged in plastic containers, and what's more, water is a healthy choice compared to some sodas and juices that are also sold at school. What do you think: Should sales of bottled water be banned from schools? We want to hear your opinion. Write a 200-word response. Send it to tfkasks4you@timeforkids.com . Your response may be published in a future issue of Time For Kids. Please include your grade level and contact information for your parent or teacher if you want your response to be published.

Can you infer where this passage is from?	"It's time to be water efficient! As populations increase across Australia and the rest of the world, demand for water will also increase. If we don't reduce each individual's demand for water (both directly and through embodied water) the water situation will become dire. It is obvious that we cannot increase demands for water much more without detrimental effects to the environment, society and the economy. It's all too easy to blame someone else for the water situation -""if 70% of water is used for agriculture then that's what we should target"" - but it's not that easy. We all depend on the food and resources that agriculture provides, and while there are definitely opportunities to increase water efficiency on the farm, the solution will take more than that. We each share responsibility for the sustainable management of our water resources, which means using less water at home, in the workplace, at school, on holidays, on the farm, ... everyone, everywhere, every time. It's time to become water efficient! This involves reassessing our relationship with water, and learning to use it more sparingly. On the most basic level, it requires a behavioural change, and assigning a value to water that truly reflects its worth. We can also unlock economic benefits of being water efficient. There are many real world examples given in the case studies on this site. Everybody has a responsibility to save water, if future generations are to enjoy a similar standard of living to the one we enjoy now. In fact, many of the impacts associated with water use are likely to have an effect on our own lives! www.savewater.com.au has been designed to help you respond to the challenge to become water efficient.

The passage is mainly concerned with _ .	"At age 61, identical twins Jeanne and Susan no longer look exactly alike. Susan smoked for many years and is an admitted sun worshipper, whose habits Jeanne does not share. A new study of twins suggests you can blame those coarse wrinkles, brown or pink spots on too much time in the sun, smoking, and being overweight. Because twins share genes, but may have different exposures to environmental factors, studying twins allows an ""opportunity to control for genetic susceptibility ,"" Dr. Elma D. Baron, at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, and his colleagues explain in the latest issue of Archives of Dermatology. Their analysis of environmental skin-damaging factors in 65 pairs of twins hints that skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors. But when it comes to skin cancer, the researchers say their findings support previous reports that both environment and genes affect skin cancer risk. Baron's team examined facial skin of 130 twins, 18 to 77 years old, who lived mostly in the northem Midwest and Eastern regions of the US, who were attending the Twins Days Festival in Ohio in August 2002. At this time, each of the twins also separately reported how their skin burned or tanned without sunscreen, their weight, and their history of skin cancer, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The study group consisted of 52 fraternal and 10 identical twin pairs, plus 3 pairs who were unsure of their twin status. From these data, the researchers noted strong ties, outside of twin status, between smoking, older age, and being overweight, and having facial skin with evidence of environmental damage. By contrast, sunscreen use and drinking alcohol appeared related to less skin damage. Baron and his colleagues say the current findings, which highlight ties between facial aging and potentially avoidable environmental factors--such as smoking, being overweight, and unprotected overexposure to the sun's damaging rays--may help motivate people to minimize these risky behaviors."

The passage is mainly about _ .	"Grown-ups know that people and objects are solid. At the movies, we know that if we reach out to touch Tom Cruise, all we will feel is air. But does a baby have this understanding? To see whether babies know objects are solid. T. Bower designed a method for projecting an optical illusion of a hanging ball. His plan was to first give babies a real ball, one they could be expected to show surprise in their faces and movements. All the 16 to 24-week-old babies tested were surprised when they reached for the illusion and found that the ball was not there. Grown-ups also have a sense of _ . We know that if we put a box in a room and lock the door, the box will still be there when we come back. But does a baby realize that a ball that rolls under a chair does not disappear and go to never-never land ? Experiments done by Bower suggest that babies develop a sense of object permanence when they are about 18 weeks old. In his experiments, Bower used a toy train that went behind a screen. When 16-week-old and 22-week-old babies watched the toy train disappear behind the left side of the screen, they looked to the right, expecting it to re-appear. If the experiment took the train off the table and lifted the screen, all the babies seemed surprised not to see the train. This seems to show that all the babies had a sense of object permanence. But the second part of the experiment showed that this was not really the case. The researcher substituted a ball for the train when it went behind the screen. The 22-week-old babies seemed surprised and looked back to the left side for the train. But the 16-week-old babies did not seem to notice the switch . Thus, the 16-week-old babies seemed to have a sense of ""something permanence,"" while the 22-week-old babies had a sense of object permanence related to a particular object."

How did Alex' s mother feel about Alex's Lemonade Stand?	"8-year-old Mario spent one day selling lemonade in New Jersey. But he didn't do it for spending money. ""The people in the hospital need more medicine,"" Mario said. Mario's lemonade stand raised money after a group called Alex's Lemonade Stand, which is an organization that raises money for research on cancers that affect kids.Their research might one day lead to a cure.The organization is named for Alexandra Scott, a girl who died of cancer eight years ago when she was eight years old.Alex' s Lemonade Stand actually began four years earlier before she died.That's when she announced that she wanted to sell lemonade to raise money for a cancer cure for all kids. This year, thousands of kids across the country are selling lemonade to raise money for Alex's foundation.In Maryland, a group of kids at the Children's Guild held a fund - raiser for Alex in April. And in Florida, Harrison began raise money for Alex's Lemonade Stand last year, when he was seven.This year, he raised more than $ 500 dollars.Harrison hoped it could help kids by scientists finding a cure.He also dreamed of finding a cure himself.""When I grow up, I'm going to invent these little 'nano-bots' that can swallow cancer.They can fight cancer for you with their little mini - lasers and stuff,"" Harrison said.

What did the owner do with the living room door?	"Once upon a time, there were two doors in a house. One was a beautiful living room door, and the other was just a normal bathroom door. There were some naughty children in the house, and they always kicked the door. The living room door was always very angry about it and hated the children. The bathroom door didn't care too much when the children kicked him. Instead, he tried to comfort the living room door. He said, ""Don't worry. It's normal. They're children, and they'll grow up soon. Before long, things will be better."" One day, the living door finally lost his temper . A child kicked him, and he broke at once. The owner of the house got very angry and told the children to be careful next time. This made the living door happy. However, the owner didn't repair him; he threw him into a landfill instead.

Miya's host family had a large network of cousins who all lived within shouting distance. The family would cook together, and at night would go dancing, talk or eat ice cream.She noted that the World Endeavors staff on location--Diego and Mercedes, and Mercedes' husband and daughter -were particularly helpful, taking her right to her neighborhood from the airport, and checking up periodically to make sure everything was going well. While her nights were spent dancing, cooking, and talking with her host family, Miya's days were occupied with the children of her host city.""I would teach in the morning, and work in the orphanage in the afternoon,"" said Miya, whose placements were within walking distance from her host family.While the children were a lot of work, Miya felt a strong connection to the kids in the orphanage.

Which of the following sentences is wrong?	We know the mosquito very well. Mosquitoes fly everywhere. They can be found almost all over the world, and there are more than 2,500 kinds of them. No one likes the mosquito. But the mosquito may decide that she loves you. She? Yes,she. It's true that male mosquito doesn't bite and only the female mosquito bites because she needs blood to lay eggs. She is always looking for things or people she wants to bite. If she likes what she finds, she bites. But if she doesn't like your blood,she will turn to someone else for more delicious blood. Next time a mosquito bites you,just remember you are chosen. You're different from the others! If the mosquito likes you,she lands on your body without letting you know. She bites you so quickly and quietly that you may not feel anything different. After she bites,you will have an itch on your body because she puts something from her mouth together with your blood. By the time the itching begins,and she has flown away. And then what happens? Well,after her delicious dinner,the mosquito feels tired. She just wants to find a place to have a good rest. There,on a leaf or a wall, she begins to lay eggs,hundreds of eggs.	['You feel terrible when the mosquito bites you.']
Which of the following do intellectual property rights not cover?	You wouldn't steal a car. You would never rob a bank or pick someone's pocket. But you may be another kind of thief. If you have ever bought a disc for 15 yuan or less, then you have helped to rob artists or musicians of their intellectual properly rights . Last Thursday was World Intellectual Property Day. Activities to tell people about intellectual property rights were held around the country. Intellectual property includes inventions, literary and artistic works, names, and pictures. They are of little value if they are not read, seen and used. While the cost of copying discs is very small, authors, singers and actors have to spend a lot of money and time making a new product. That's why they have the right to make money from their work. So buying pirated music of Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai is like stealing from them, paying them no respect for their hard work. If Jay Chou cannot make money from his work, he may not make anything else. But those who make pirated goods are becoming rich without doing any hard work. The authors should ask for a fair price for their work. Earlier this year there was much talk about how much KTV clubs should pay the music companies for using their songs. The copyright fee also should be fair to the users. That's good for the music's popularity and society as well.	['Pirated music.']
Which statement does the article lead you to believe?	A person steps on what seems like solid ground but discovers with horror that the ground is giving way underfoot. The person struggles desperately but is trapped. There is no escape. Slowly the person sinks deeper and at last is gone. The solid ground was solid only in appearance. It was actually quicksand, which is a deep mass of fine sand mixed with water. How is quicksand formed? Water pushes up from below the surface and is held by the sand. The grains of sand are forced apart by the water. They cannot hold any weight. The subsurface water may have come from a spring, a river, or a stream. Sometimes pools of water near beaches become filled with sand. When the soil under these pools does not allow for good drainage , the sand can become stretches of quicksand. Is it true that a person who steps into quicksand is doomed to die? No, for people have fought their way from quicksand to firm land again. It is panic that creates the condition that can result in death, for the more a person struggles, the worse matters become. Quick movements will make the sand yield for a time, but then it rushes back and settles solidly around the body. People trapped in quicksand should either lie back with arms outstretched, or not move at all. When the weight of the sand around his body has displaced equals that person's weight, the victim will stop sinking. With feet held still, and with slow movements of the arms, as in the backstroke in swimming, people have managed to roll to safety and reach firm ground.

In the prefix = st1 /United States, almost half of the high school graduates _ .	Education in the United States is compulsory for children up to about the age of sixteen.Most young people stay in school longer than that. Most graduate from high school at the age of 17 or 18. Almost half of these high school graduates continue their education at a college or university.Education for most young people in this country is free up to the time they graduate from high school.There are private schools, but most parents send their children to public schools, where students do not pay tuition . When young people go to college, however,they must pay tuition at a public university or a private university.University costs are going up a lot:private universities have become very expensive because the government does not help them. Who pays? The parents of children in college may have to pay more,or often the students may have to find jobs.These students have to worry about assignments and grades and also about their jobs.If they work too much at their jobs they may be absent from class or miss assignments or make too many errors on tests.They may even fail their courses and have to leave the university. For many students, the problem of getting an education is not just a problem of homework and exams.They also have to make money to pay for tuition.And professors don't teach them how to do that!

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	A global positioning system(GPS)service is aiding the elderly in the Panlong district of Kunming,capital of Southwest China's Yunnan province. The telecommunications service provider,with the support o,f the local govemment,started the GPS tracking service in January to help the elderly,especially those with Alzheimer's disease,a condition that slowly destroys memory. Huang Haiying,an employee with a local telecommunications company,told China Daily that with the GPS devices ,the people who look after the elderly can quickly find their positions either online or by ca l l ing the service center in case ot emergencles. The system is also connected to the police,hospitals,fire services and community service centers to ensure that the elderly get quick and proper help,Huang said. Experts said that this service could improve the quality of life for thousands of elderly people with Alzheimer's,their families and those who look after them. Hundreds of people have already been helped by the service this year,Huang said. Huang said that the system has about 1 0,000 subscribers and she expects that number to grow 1 0 times over the next three years.A user pays 25 yuan($4)each month for the service.A family with an income below the local poverty line can get a 10 yuan subsidy evcry month from the government. The local government has spent more than 2 million yuan to subsidize the service to date. Rao Yuehui,director of the Panlong civil affairs department,said that about 90,000 people,or 15.4 percent of the district'S population,are more than.60 years old. He Xiangqun,an official with the Yunnan provincial civil affairs department,said that this means that the population meets international standards classifying it, as an aging society as defined by the United Nations.

The existence of the privately owned mass media depends on the support of _ .	"In the West, advertisements are the fuel that makes mass media work. Many TV stations, newspapers, magazines, radio stations are privately owned. The government does not give them money. So where does the money come from? From advertisements. Without advertisements, there would not be these private businesses. Have you ever asked yourself what advertising is? Through the years, people have given different answers to the question. For some time it was felt that advertising was a means of ""keeping your name before the public"". And some people thought that advertising was ""truth well told"". Now more and more people consider it in this way: Advertising is the paid, non-personal, and usually persuasive presentation of goods, services and ideas by some certain sponsors through various media. First, advertising is usually paid for. Various sponsors pay for the advertisements we see, read, and hear over the various media. Second, advertising is non-personal. It is not face-to-face communication. Although you may feel that a message in a certain advertisement is aimed directly at you, in fact, it is directed at large groups of people. Third, advertising is usually persuasive. Directly or indirectly it asks people to do something. All advertisements try to make people believe that the product, idea, or service advertised can benefit them. Fourth, the sponsors of the advertisement must show their names. From the advertisement, we can see if the sponsor is a company, or a single person. Fifth, advertising reaches us through old and modern mass media. Included in the old media are newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and films. Modern media include emails, matchbox covers, and boards on top of buildings."	['advertisements']
Which can be the best title?	"Wikipedia is a free-access, free content Internet encyclopedia , supported and hosted by the non-profit Wikipedia Foundation. Wikipedia is ranked among the ten most popular websites and is considered the Internet's largest and most popular general reference book. Now, Wikipedia is becoming Wookiepedia as scientists hope the informative website will help us reach out to intelligent life forms. So aliens can learn about the human race. Astronomers would like to beam the entire contents of Wikipedia into space in the hope of contacting aliens. They want to send messages to hundreds of star systems and planets 20 light years away using radio telescopes. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute, in California, wants to use powerful radio telescopes to try to reach Chewbacca and his mates in a galaxy far away. The plans will be discussed by astronomers at the weekend as some scientists fear the reply from ET might not turn out to be friendly. Institute scientist David Black said, ""One question is if there are dangerous creatures we might be drawing their attention to ourselves. Another is if we go ahead, what message should be sent? There could be many civilizations out there,but if they are all listening and no one is broadcasting or responding, then nothing will happen.""

Which of the following words best describes the boy?	"John had been on a business trip for three weeks. It was coming up on Mother's Day, and he usually tried to go back home, but this time he was too tired. He was in a small town outside of Little Rock when he drove by a flower shop. He decided to send his mother some roses. He went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. ""How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?"" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe he should be happy with carnations . ""No, I have to have roses,"" he said, ""My mom was sick so much last year and I had little time with her. It has to be red roses, 'cause that's her favourite."" The florist shook her head. John was touched by the boy, who wanted to get those roses so badly. John looked at the florist and silently mouthed that he would pay for the boy's roses. Then the florist said, ""Ok, I will give you a dozen red roses for your six dollars."" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement. John ordered his own flowers and had the florist be sure that delivery would include a note telling his mother how much he loved her. Then he drove away from the shop. As he waited at the light, he saw the young man crossing the street and enter a park through two huge gates. Suddenly, he realized it wasn't a park. It was a cemetery . The light changed, and John slowly crossed the road, parked his car and got out to follow the boy down the fence. The boy stopped by a small monument and went on his knee. He carefully laid the roses on the ground and cried, ""Mommy, why didn't I tell you how much I love you?, Jesus, please. Tell my mommy I love her."" John turned, tears in his eyes, and walked back to his car. He drove quickly to the flower shop and told the florist he would take the flowers personally."	['Poor']
Who was Jack the Ripper?	"Most people have some common sense. When we see something suspicious on TV, in the newspaper, or on the Internet, we roll our eyes and wonder how anyone could believe something so stupid. Nevertheless, there are stories that even educated people still believe. These tales may or may not be true, but they leave us wondering whether they are real or not. On National Geographic Channel, these stories are dissected in full detail in the series Is It Real. Thousands of years ago, aliens landed on the Earth. They tampered with the evolution of humans and the results of this can be seen practically everywhere. Sound ridiculous? Not to some people. Believe it or not, there are those who believe that alien astronauts had a hand in making the human race what it is today. Travel back in time with Ancient Astronauts and visit our ""alien ancestors"". In the autumn of 1888, Jack the Ripper roamed the streets of London's East End. After his reign of terror was over, five women had been killed. To this day, the mystery of who killed these ladies remains unsolved. No one knows for sure, but the truth may be revealed on Jack the Ripper. Vampires . Just the thought of these fictional beasts is enough to make your blood run cold. While we may think that they only come to life in books and movies, vampires are actually based on real people. Historians, folklorists, scientists and doctors all work together to investigate the plausibility of vampires. Take a bite into this juicy mystery on Vampires. No other channel can offer this type of programming other than National Geographic Channel. In this unique series, they've stripped away 12 myths that have stood the test of time to expose the truth and find out the answer to the question--Is it real?"

We can describe Greg as _ .	"The story of the day I lost my best friend to a car accident. The day a precious life was taken from us way too soon. It was a bright and Sunny day in November. Thanksgiving had been celebrated only two days before. Since it was a holiday weekend I had been on the phone with Greg the night before many times. His dad didn't want him to come over because of the holiday. I guess he finally wore him down and he called and said, ""I can stay"". So, my mom, brother, and I went to pick him up. He was always smiling. The complete opposite of my shy self, Greg was always the life of the party. We got two large pizzas that Friday night. I've never known anyone in my entire life who loved to eat more than Greg. That's the way he was though. He was just enjoying life. And if it meant gaining weight or whatever, so be it. He would sit back and put his hands on his belly and just laugh. We (Greg, David, and I) did so many funny things together and had such great times. Things we should have done and things we shouldn't have done, I'll ""Never"" forget. On Saturday morning Dad took us out for breakfast. We all finished eating and followed my Dad up to the cashier. Greg asked Dad if he could have a candy bar. I looked at Greg shaking my head. He just laughed. After breakfast, Father took us to my Mom's house. When we got out at Mom's house there was no one home. So, one of us grabbed a big wheel and rode it down the steep driveway into the street. Just boys being boys. Greg and I did it several times until the last time. The car hit him on the head, knocking him around 75-- 100 yards. My brother and I both ran screaming just yelling for help and crying. One of the neighbors called 911. I was in shock. That day was forever etched into our memories. It still hurts to think about it. Wishing we could have grown old together. Wondering how it would have been. I'm sure It WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT."	['easy-going and optimistic']
According to the text, what is diapause?	We bet that on cold wintry days, many of you love to stay in your warm home and, every now and then, come out into the kitchen for a snack. Unfortunately, plenty of creepy-crawly critters like to do the same thing! Winter is the time when bugs invade your house without an invitation. The season can be tough for such creatures. In winter the air is cold, the ground is hard and many trees have no leaves. So bugs do what they have to do to survive. Monarch butterflies head south to warmer climates. Ants crowd in deep underground colonies and eat food they have been storing all year. Many insects go into a deep sleep called diapause. There're different kinds of diapause, but all are similar to hibernation, a time when bigger animals become inactive in the cold. Insects go into an inactive period, too, but it often isn't when the temperature drops. They rely on more dependable signals in the environment. For example, many insects can tell how much sunlight there's each day. They use that to tell themselves when to shut down. Bugs are cold-blood-ed, meaning that their inside temperature is the same as the outside. They can't move much when it gets below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. So they search for any warm place. They're looking for protection. These guys have been doing this for 300 million years, so they don't really know they're coming into your house. The home is a recent event in terms of their evolutionary behav-ior. They enter through tiny cracks or come in unnoticed on your clothes or shoes. Remember that they may be invading your homes for warmth and food, but they don't care about humans.	['It is a deep sleep similar to hibernation.']
_ told Loin that Rabbit was the new King of the Jungle.	"Lion was the King of the Jungle . One day, Giraffe told Lion, ""Rabbit says he is the new King of the Jungle."" ""What?"" Lion was very angry. He went to meet Rabbit. The other animals followed him to see what he would do. ""Rabbit,"" said Lion, ""Why do you say that you are the new King of the Jungle?"" ""Oh, but it's true,"" said Rabbit. ""I'm faster and cleverer than you. We can have a competition ."" ""All right,"" said Lion. Rabbit took Lion to a deep ravine . He said, ""If I fly down to the ravine faster than you, I am faster and cleverer than you. So I go, or you will go first?"" ""Of course I will go first,"" said Lion, ""I am the King of the Jungle!"" He then threw himself into the deep ravine. Rabbit smiled and said to the other animals. ""I am your new king now. I am faster and cleverer than Lion."" The other animals didn't understand. ""Lion was stupid! Anyone will die after jumping into the ravine!"""	['Giraffe']
This passage is mainly about _ .	"Who taught you to speak English? Your parents, while you were a child? Your teacher at school? Perhaps even the BBC as a grown-up. Whoever it was, somehow you have developed an understanding of what is rapidly becoming a truly global language. There are now about 376 million people who speak English as their first language, and about the same number who have learnt it in addition to their mother tongue. There are said to be one billion people learning English now and about 80% of the information on the Internet is in English. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? Should we celebrate the fact that more and more of us can communicate, using a common language, across countries and cultures? Or should we worry about the dangers of "" mono-culturalism"", a world in which we all speak the same language, eat the same food and listen to the same music? Does it matter if an increasing number of people speak the same language? I would have thought the other way around although I have never accepted the argument that if only we all understood each other better, there would be fewer wars. _ ... If we all speak English, will we then all start eating McDonalds burgers? Surely not. If English becomes more dominant , it will kill other languages? I doubt it. When I travel in Africa or Asia, I am always surprised by how many people can speak not only their own language but often one or more other related languages, as well as English and perhaps some French or German as well. When we discussed this on Talking Point a couple of years ago, we received a wonderfully poetic email from a listener in Ireland. ""The English language is a beautiful language. Maybe it's like a rose,"" he said. ""But who would ever want their garden just full of roses?"" Well, I love roses, and I think they make a beautiful addition to any garden. But the way I see it, just by planting a few roses, you don't necessarily need to pull out everything else. If more and more people want to plant English roses, that's fine by me."

The passage above is _ .	"Once upon a time, there was a spider with the name Anansi. He knew that he was very clever but he also knew he wasn't wise. He didn't like this, but he did not know what to do. One day he had an idea. He went around the village with a basket and asked each person to give him some of their wisdom. The people laughed at Anansi because they knew that he needed wisdom the most. So each person put a bit in his basket and wished him good luck. Soon his basket was full, but Anansi was worried that his neighbors might be jealous( ) of his wisdom and take it from him. He decided to hide it at the top of a tall tree. When he had tied the basket to the front part of his body, he tried to climb the tree, but it was too difficult. He tried again and again with out success. Then his youngest son walked by. ""What are you doing, father?"" he asked and Anansi told him."" Why don't you carry the basket on your back instead?"" his son said. Anansi put the basket on his back and climbed the tree easily, but he wasn't happy. ""I walked all over the village and collected so much wisdom that I am the wisest person ever, but my baby son is still wiser than me. Take back your wisdom!"" he said. And he threw the basket of wisdom into the air and went home. And that's how wisdom went all over the world."	['a story']
Where did the writer met Pixar?	"Five years ago, I met her in a shopping center. I was walking through the shop when I saw her. Then she came back to my house with me. After that, we became friends. Once she had to go into hospital to have an operation on her leg. I was worried about her and looked after her every day. I made breakfast for her. I was not good at cooking, but she never complained. I also helped her take showers. I have no idea why we can be good friends, because she is quite different from me. I like writing, reading and playing computer games. But she loves outdoor activities. She likes playing balls best. She also loves sleeping.

Would you like me to cut it into small pieces for you?"" ""Oh, I don't want to buy the meat,"" Mrs. Parker said.

The best title for this passage would be _ .	Americans are proud of their variety and individuality,yet they love and respect few things more than a uniform,whether it is the uniform of an elevator operator or the uniform of a fivestar general. Why are uniforms so popular in the United States? Among the arguments for uniforms,one of the first is that in the eyes of most people they look more professional than civilian clothes. People have become conditioned to expect superior quality from a man who wears a uniform. The television repairman who wears a uniform tends to inspire more trust than one who appears in civilian clothes. Faith in the skill of a garage mechanic is increased by a uniform. What easier way is there for a nurse,a policeman,a barber,or a waiter to lose professional identity than to step out of uniform? Uniforms also have many practical benefits. They save on other clothes. They save on laundry bills. They are taxdeductible .They are often more comfortable and more durable than civilian clothes. Primary among the arguments against uniforms is their lack of variety and the consequent loss of individuality experienced by people who must wear them. Though there are many types of uniforms,the wearer of any particular type is generally stuck with it,without change,until retirement. When people look alike,they tend to think,speak,and act similarly,on the job at least. Uniforms also give rise to some practical problems. Though they are longlasting,often their initial expense is greater than the cost of civilian clothes. Some uniforms are also expensive to maintain(,),requiring professional dry cleaning rather than the home laundering possible with many types of civilian clothes.

From the passage we know that our dreams _ .	"Let us begin by saying what does not cause our dreams. Our dreams do not come from ""another world "". They are not messages from outside source. They are not a look into the future , either . All our dreams have something to do with our feelings, fears, longings, wishes, needs and memories. If a person is hungry , or tired or cold , his dreams may include a feeling of this kind .If the covers on your body , such as a quilt or a blanket have slipped off your bed , you may dream that you are sleeping on the ice and snow. The material for the dream you will have tonight is likely to come from the experience you have today. So the subject of your dream usually comes from something that has effect on you while you are sleeping (feeling of cold, a noise, a discomfort, etc.) and it may also use your past experiences and the wishes and the interests you have now.This is why children are likely to dream of fairies, older children of school examinations, hungry people of food, home-sick soldiers of their families and prisoners of freedom. To show you how this is happening while you are asleep and how your needs and wishes can all be joined together in a dream , here is the story of the experiment.A man was asleep and the back of his hand was rubbed with a piece of absorbed cotton.He would dream he was in hospital and his charming girlfriend was visiting him , sitting on the bed and feeling gently his hands! There are some scientists who have made a special study of why we dream, what we dream and what those dreams mean.Their explanations of dreams , though a bit reasonable, is not accepted by everyone but it offers an interesting approach to the problem.They believe that dreams are mostly expressions of wishes that do not come true.In other words, dreams are a way of having your wishes carried out."	['are to some degree connected with our feelings']
Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance _ .	Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do.	['has much to do with culture']
The article tells us that_.	Steve Jobs-A surprising success. Nothing in the early years of Steve Job's life suggested that he would be so successful. Born in San Francisco, the child of two students, he was adopted and grew up close to Silicon Valley. While at company-and he and his best friend Steve Wozniak got summer jobs there. After finishing high school in 1972, Jobs studied at an expensive liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon but he dropped pout after one after one term. He grew his hair and a beard, slept on friends' floors, and sometimes went to a Hare Krishna temple for free meals. Like many drop-outs at that Beatles-inspired time, his ambition was to visit a guru([])in India, which he eventually did with a friend. When they got there, the guru had died. At this point, Jobs has a limited education, and no obvious talents, apart from a notorious ability to talk. However, he did have a devoted friend who was an electronics genius. They were a great team. Without Jobs' s ambition, high design standards, the ability to make deals and great maketing skills-Wozniak might well have spent a quiet life designing hardware at HP.

How can a college graduate increase his or her yearly income according to the passage?	"As the price of a college degree continues to rise, there's growing evidence that the monetary payoff isn't quite as big as often advertised. The best estimate now is that a college degree is worth about $300,000 in today's dollars--nowhere near the million figure that is often quoted. ""That million number has driven me crazy!"" says Sandy Baum, a Skidmore economist who studied the value of a college degree for the College Board last year. Baum's research showed that college graduates earn, on average, about $20,000 a year more than those who finished their educations at high school. Add that up over a 40-year working life and the total differential is about $800,000, she figures. But since much of that bonus is earned many years from now, taking away the impact of inflation means that$800,000 in future dollars is worth only about $450,000 in today's dollars. Then, if you remove the cost of a college degree--about ,$30,000 in tuition and books for students who get no aid and attend public in-state universities--and the money a student could have earned at a job instead of attending school, the real net value in today's dollars is somewhere in the $300,000 range, a number confirmed by other studies. But, especially these days, that still makes a college degree one of the most _ investments a person can make, Baum notes. Better yet, college graduates can go on to earn advanced degrees, which return even bigger payoffs. The average holder of a bachelor's degree earns about$51,000 a year, Baum calculates. But those who've gone on to earn MBAs, law degrees, or other professional degrees earn about $100,000 a year. In addition, Baum found that there are plenty of other rewards for a degree. The quality of the jobs college graduates get is far better, for example. College graduates are more likely to get jobs with health insurance. And it is easier for them to find and hold jobs. The unemployment rate for college graduates was just 2.2 percent last year, half the unemployment level of those with only high school diplomas. There are lots of other nonmonetary benefits as well. College graduates are healthier, contribute more to their communities, and raise kids who are better prepared academically, studies show. Other researchers have found that the payoff of a degree is especially lucrative for students from low-income families, since the education and degrees give them a chance to break out of low-paying careers."

It is hard to explain what a painter is saying because _ .	Every artist knows in his heart that he is saying something to the public. Not only does he want to say it well, but he wants it to be something that has not been said before. He hopes that the public will listen and understand ----he wants to teach them, and he wants them to learn from him. What visional artists like painters want to teach is easy to make out but difficult to explain, because painters translate their experience into shapes and colors, not words. They seem to feel that a certain choice of shapes and colors, out of the countless billions possible, is very interesting for them and worth showing to us. Without their work we should never have noticed these particular shapes and colors, or have felt the delight which they brought to the artists. Most artists take their shapes and colors from the world of nature and from human bodies in movement and at rest; their choices show that these aspects of the world are worth looking at, that they contain beautiful sights. Modern artists might say that they only choose subjects that provide an interesting pattern, that there is nothing more in it. Yet even they do not choose totally without thinking about the character of their subjects. If one painter chooses to paint a decaying leg and another a lake in moonlight, each of them is directing our attention to a certain aspect of the world . Each painter is telling us something, showing us something, emphasizing something - all of which means that, consciously or unconsciously, he is trying to teach us.

The manager of the drugstore shouted at the writer in dirty words because _ .	"There was one shop in the town of Mufulira which was widely known for its racial discrimination. It was a drugstore .While Europeans were served at the counter ,a long line of Africans queued at the window and often not only were kept waiting but were treated rudely by the shop assistants .One day I was determined to make a public protest against this kind of thing ,and many of the schoolboys in my class followed me to the store. I simply went into the shop and asked the manager politely for some medicine. As soon as he saw me standing in the place where only European customers were allowed to stand ,he shouted at me in a bastard language which is only used by a boss when speaking to his servants .I stood at the counter and politely requested in proper English that I should be served .The manager became angry and said , ""Even if you stand till Christmas ,I will never serve you ."" I went to the District Commissioner's office .Fortunately ,he was out ,for _ however ,I saw a young District Officer who was a friend of mine .He was very concerned to hear my story and told me that all I had to do was come to him personally and he would buy my medicine for me .I protested that that was not good enough .I asked him to accompany me back to the store and to make a protest to the manager .This he did ,and I well remember him saying to the manager , ""Here is Mr. Kaunda who is a responsible member of the Urban Advisory Council, and you treat him like a common servant ."" The manager of the drugstore apologized and said , ""If only he had introduced himself and explained who he was ,then ,of course ,I should have given him proper service."" I had to explain once again that he had missed my point .Why should I have to introduce myself every time I went into a store...any more than I should have to buy my medicine by going to a European friend ?

Why did the master buy a lot of chilies?	"There once was a master who went to India. In those times, we didn't have the communications or airplanes or many kinds of transportation that we do now. So the master went to India on foot. He had never been to India before; perhaps he came from Persia. And when he got there, he saw a lot of fruit. In India they have plenty of fruit to sell, but much of it is expensive because they can't grow much due to the water situation. So he saw one basket, a big basket of some very red, long fruit. And it was the cheapest in the shop, not expensive at all. So he went up and asked, ""How much per kilo?"" And the shopkeeper said, ""Two rupees ."" Two rupees in India is nothing; it's like dirt. So he bought a whole kilogram of the fruit and started eating it. But after he ate some of it: Oh, my God! His eyes watered, his mouth watered and burned, his eyes were burning, his head was burning and his face became red. As he coughed and choked and gasped for breath, he jumped up and down, saying, ""Ah! Ah! Ah!""But he still continued to eat the fruit! Some people who were looking at him shook their heads and said, ""You're crazy, man. Those are chilies ! You can't eat so many; they're not good for you! People use them as a condiment , but only a little bit to put into food for taste. You can't just eat them by the handful like that; they're not fruit!"" So the stupid master said, ""No, I can't stop! I paid money for them, and now I'll eat them. It's my money!"" And you think that master was stupid, right? Similarly, we sometimes do a lot of things like that. We invest money, time or effort in a relationship, business or job. And even though it's been a long time, bitter experience tells us it won't work, and we know there's no more hope that things will change in the future -- this we definitely know by intuition -- we still continue just because we've invested money, time, effort and love into it. Just like the man who ate the chilies and suffered so much but couldn't stop because he didn't want to waste the money he'd paid."	['The price of chilies is very low.']
"The word ""exodus"" in Para3 can be probably explained by _"	"About 6,000doctors in theprefix = st1 /Philippinesare studying to become nurses so they can find higher-paying jobs abroad, Health Secretary Francisco Duque says. This was up from 2,000 doctors who studied to become nurses last year, Duque said. The exodus of doctors and nurses had created a ""threatening situation for our health care system"" and a task force had been established to examine the potential impact, he said. The team was working on a bill which would require doctors to practice in thePhilippinesfor at least three to four years before they were able to work abroad. ""I think the problem really is the migration of doctors. We have so many nurses now, more than enough to fill up(vacancies). But our doctors are leaving,"" Duque said. A study by the University of thePhilippineshad found that between 2000to 2003 more than 50,000 Filipino nurses went abroad to work. A doctor working in a government hospital in thePhilippinesearns only about 25,000 pesos(446 dollars) a month. A doctor could earn around 8,000dollars a month while working as a nurse overseas. Even lawyers, accountants and engineers are enrolling to brain as nurses. Filipino nurses are in demand in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and even closer to home, such as in Singapore and Japan. However, Health officials have warned the country faces a ""medical apocalypse"" if it continues to lose its health professionals to jobs abroad."	['leave of many people at one time']

Taiyuan forbids taking pets into its parks The local government of Taiyuanhas banned pets from being taken into the city's parks. The regulation, which came into effect on Saturday, states that anyone who takes pets into parks will be fined from 10 yuan (US$1.27) to 200(US$25). The local government said it introduced the rule because pets may cause harm to other park visitors and their waste pollutes the environment.

According to the passage, Corey _ .	"He is a familiar sight, the old man who asks change from drivers stopped at a red light on East 35th Street in Slidtown Manhattan every day. After all, he has been at it for 17 years now, seven days a week. With the help of a walker, he hobbles between lanes of traffic, approaching drivers, offering newspapers --- often a free paper collected from boxes on the sidewalk nearby --and asking for change.""Help a guy out?"" he repeats to drivers who will usually hand over a dollar or some change. Most drivers simply regard him as another homeless down-and-out ,but every so often one might realize that it's the legendary comedian Professor Irwin Corey, who is now 98. Over his eight-decade career, he has been on television and in comedy clubs, nightclubs and concert halls worldwide. He began his stage career on Broadway in 1943. Indeed, he still performs fairly regularly -- a week ago he flew to Chicago to play two nights at a local club. And though he has a homeless appearance, Mr. Corey lives in a comfortable 1840 carriage house on East 36th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues that he estimates could sell for $3.5 million. Mr. Corey said he gathers his daily take-- usually about $100, though there have been $250 days-- every few months and donates the money to a charity that buys medical supplies for children in Cuba. As for the drivers he solicits, Mr. Corey said, ""I don't tell them where the money's going, and I'm sure they don't care."" Mr. Corey has traveled to Cuba to donate personally. There are photographs of him with President Fidel Castro on his wall. One is with an inscription by Castro: With admiration, gratitude and affection."	['is still going on with his acting career']
It can be concluded from the passage that _ .	"It's hard to be the bearer of bad news,but most of IKEA's print and digital fascinating shots of picturesque rooms and products are fake.Those beautiful,""natural-looking"" photos of gorgeous rooms and kitchens are mostly the work of computer magic,adjusted and corrected until they're picture-perfect. Martin Enthed,IT manager for IKEA's in-house communications agency,revealed,""In 2012,12 per cent of its product and concept images was CGI-rendered,increasing to 25 per cent in 2013.Since then,that percentage of rendered images appearing in the company's catalogue and online has tripled.75 per cent of the furniture company's product images today are created by computers."" It's a move that first caught the attention of photographers and graphic designers a few years back when the furniture giant announced it would cancel photoshoots in favor of computer-generated imagery(CGI). Enthed said IKEA began shifting equipment in 2009 when company officials called in his team and said they weren't pleased with some previous photos and CG images. ""So we looked at all the images they said weren't good and the two of three they said were great,and the ones they didn't like were photography and the good ones were all CG,""Enthed said.""Now we only talk about a good or bad image - not what technique created it."" It's a not-so-secret strategy used by top companies specializing in home and furniture design,though many consumers remain oblivious. The company claims the shift is another way to reduce its environmental footprint,saying constructing digital files produces less waste.It also helps the home furnishing empire's pocketbooks."

Where did the writer spend her vacation?	Our flat was on the fifth floor but you could still hear the roar of the ocean and see the stars at night. I used to take long walks along the water. The food in town was delicious and the people were very friendly. The area was very quiet and peaceful, and fairly deserted. The last evening of our vacation, however, we all heard strange footsteps following closely behind us as we were walking up to our flat in the holiday centre. We turned around and noticed a fairly young man moving very rapidly across the beach and getting closer to us. He was tall and wore a baseball cap. We couldn't see his face and he was approaching us very rapidly. The man's actions made my dad very nervous. Dad warned us that we'd better try to make it to our flat as quickly as possible. I didn't like my dad's voice; I could hear fear in it. It was late and we were all alone. We didn't have any cell phones on us. I never saw Dad as worried as he was then and I knew that something was terribly wrong. The sense of fear started to overwhelm Mom and me. We had had such a good time in town. Now, the night was rapidly turning into a dangerous situation. We could hear the man's footsteps getting closer. Dad's face was almost pale. The so-called intruder had moved nearer and nearer when all of a sudden, the nearby vending machine started going crazy and spitting out cans of soda! The noise actually scared the intruder and he ran out of sight. My parents were shaking, but we all turned around to see who had put money into the vending machine downstairs, and actually saved us, but no one was around at all. Not a soul. It's one vacation I will never forget.	['At the seaside.']
Most of the time in our daily life, we _ .	"During communication, ""words"" express only 7% of meanings between people. About 23% of meanings are from the ""tone of voice"" and 70% of meanings come from ""body language"". So next time you want someone's attention--try body language instead. Everyone does it, and most interestingly--most do it unconsciously. You may wonder: ""Does that mean I have to study psychology to succeed in reading body language?"" The answer is ""no"" because most people are already body language readers. It's a skill developed since we're babies--think of how most babies can recognize facial expressions and get attention without saying anything. That is, you needn't spend most of your time practicing some of your body language cues ! However, you should know that the context is king. It suggests that, depending on the context of the situation, people will hide body language cues. So sometimes cues can be tricky: a woman who locks her arms may think you are boring--or she may just feel cold. You must learn to read into the context as well as the cues. Sometimes people care more about their body language cues. For example, poker players will consciously hide more of their body language cues. The first place to start when reading a person's body language is the face. The easiest way to hide your feelings is to cover your face. This is why it's sometimes hard to tell if an Islamic girl likes you. If the eyes are the windows of the mind, the eyebrows are the windows of the eyes. So, notice how a person's eyebrows will generally rise when they meet someone, see something they like or are surprised at. Eyes generally smile along with the mouth when someone is happy, so everyone knows ""^ . ^""."	"[""don't realize we're using body language""]"
The first film of the 007 series is _ .	"The title of next James bond film is Skyfall, which has already started filming. The film will be on in the UK on 26 October 2012 and in the United States on 9 November 2012. It has been 50 years since Sean Connery was announced as the first man to play Bond in the film named Dr No. Do you expect Skyfall which is the 23rdfilm in the 007 series? At London's Corinthi a Hotel, the official gave a little information about the storyline: Bond's loyal attitude toward his boss Miss M will be tested when one of her past staff comes back to hurt her. As MI6 is in danger, 007 needs to solve problems and protect MI6 whatever it costs. Mendes, who won a best director Oscar for 1999's American Beauty, told fans that Skyfall would have all the features of a classic Bond movie, such as a lot of action. ""Daniel Craig is back for a third time as 007 along with Dame Judi Dench as his boss Miss M."" said Mendes. Many famous actors and actresses who have Oscar wins and nominations are included, but the filmmakers remain keeping their roles in the film secret. Producers are showing no signs of cutting off the cost of Skyfall. ""It is at the same level as the 2008's Quantum of Solace, which cost about $200m. The film will be made in the Whitehall, Scotland, China and Turkey, as well as Pinewood Studios."" Said a producer. Why has 007 been popular for so long? Professor James Chapman of Leicester University, the author of the book A Cultural History of the James Bond Films, said, ""They manage to let each new film meet the changes not just in society but in the popular taste of film culture. That lets each generation get their own Bond."""	['Dr No']

An hour later we came back to the car with a lot of things. Then the trouble started. We could not open the car door. ""Oh, dear,"" said my wife. ""What are we going to do?"" ""Let's ask that policeman,"" I said. The policeman was very kind and glad to help us. Soon he got the door open. Just at that moment an angry man came up and shouted.

Which of the following is the writer's opinion?	"We can't remember clearly since when we started to take our mobiles to a dinner table.This happens a lot,especially when we eat out.Once a dish comes,instead of lifting our chopsticks,we take out our mobiles and click.Later,we post the photos onto Weibo or Wechat,waiting to be""liked"".Then we check our mobiles from time to time during the meal,to see whether we get""liked""or not.We just cannot leave our mobiles for only a meal. Does that sound familiar to you?Do you do that often?If not,how do you feel when others do that when having dinner with you? A recent study suggests that what we are used to doing is not so good.Spending time taking photos of food makes the food less pleasant.To test this,some researchers did an experiment.Some people were asked to take photos before they could enjoy food.As a result,it showed that the more photos they took, _ .So,why not stop taking photos and just enjoy the food in front of you?

Which was the main trouble my grandfather had in helping his friend?	"My grandfather had a small farm where he raised beef and some grain for feed. He also worked diligently as a factory laborer and country pastor. He was a good neighbor and well-respected for honoring his word. When harvest time came, he'd piece together his old one-row corn picker and oil it up for the season. All his life he worked hard, helped others, and you could count on him to keep his promises. He had promised to harvest a few ribbons of corn on a friend's farm, but after harvesting his own corn, Grandpa's little corn picker coughed and quit. It would be out of commission until a particular part could be ordered, but that would take far too long to help this year. The factory where Grandpa worked began to require overtime. In order to keep his job there he had to leave the farm before dawn and get home until well after sunset. One autumn night, while harvest time was running out, he and his wife sat at the kitchen table and trying to figure a way out of their dilemma. ""There's nothing you can do,"" said my grandma. ""You'll just have to tell him that you can't help with the corn this year."" ""Well that just doesn't sit well with me,"" said my grandpa. ""My friend is depending on me. I can't exactly let my neighbor's harvest rot in the field, can I?"" ""When do you think you'd have time to do it?"" she asked. ""With the overtime you've been working you'd be up all night."" ""I know of one night that I could do it!"" he said, running to the bookshelf. He grabbed the Farmer's Almanac and started flipping through the pages. ""Aha! There's still one more full moon in October."" They say it's called the harvest moon because it gives farmers more light and more time to collect their crops. And so a few days later, after a long shift at the factory, my grandpa made his way to the field where my grandma met him in the truck with dinner. The weather was cold but clear, and the moon was brilliant. He worked through the night to keep his word. I know this story well, so sometimes, when I'm tempted to cut corners or to put off responsibilities, I think of my grandfather with his scythe cutting wide arcs of corn in the light of the harvest moon."	['His corn picker broke down.']
Which of the following has not been used as a verb, yet?	"It's not a new phenomenon, but have you noticed how many nouns are being used as verbs? We all use them, often without noticing what we're doing. I was arranging to meet someone for dinner last week, and I said ""I'll pencil it in my diary"", and my friend said ""You can ink it in"", meaning that it was a firm arrangement not a tentative one! Many of these new verbs are linked to new technology. An obvious example is the word fax. We all got used to sending and receiving faxes, and then soon started talking about faxing something and promising we'd fax it immediately. Then along came email, and we were soon all emailing each other madly. How did we do without it? I can hardly imagine life without my daily emails. Email reminds me, of course, of my computer and its software, which has produced another couple of new verbs. On my computer I can bookmark those pages from the World Wide Web that I think I'll want to look at again, thus saving all the effort of remembering their addresses and calling them up from scratch. I can do the same thing on my PC, but there I don't bookmark; I favorite--coming from ""favorite pages"", so the verb is derived from an adjective not a noun. Now my children bought me a mobile phone, known simply as a mobile and I had to learn yet more new verbs. I can message someone, that is, I can leave a message for them on their phone. Or I can text them, write a few words suggesting when and where to meet, for example. How long will it be before I can mobile them, that is, phone them using my mobile? I haven't heard that verb yet, but I'm sure I will soon. Perhaps I'll start using it myself!"	['mobile']
68. What's the most probable reason the writer mentions Jascha Richter's song twice in the passage?	"Jascha Richter once sang ""don't need too much talking without saying anything"" to reveal his lonely feeling in a crowd. Dad always told me never to ever reveal my true opinions towards other people if such opinions are negative. He said this is the ""Chu Shi Zhe Xue"", the philosophy of dealing with social network. It seems that everybody here just follows this philosophy very, very well. Friends. I would say that if I were given true friendship I would definitely treasure it with my greatest care. If I really regard someone as my close friend, I would never leave her alone whenever she's in need, either financially or mentally. And I always believe, as long as I treat people with whole-hearted honesty, I would have some rewards--at least, just ONE true friend of the same gender . Sometimes I just miss my friends in China. Perhaps when we became friends, we were still young, too young to have been polluted by any dirt in the society. But here, it is simply different. It seems that all of us have learnt how to SURVIVE in a foreign land and such an experience actually makes us learn how to extract the most benefits from the surroundings in order to survive. All are friends around me. I've looked through all the dark sides of their personalities and yet I have to pretend that I know nothing. THEY ARE GOOD. THEY ARE GOOD. AND WE ARE FRIENDS. And then I can make myself comfortable enough to talk to people I hate the most. And of course, they don't say any words truly from their hearts. Neither do I. But, sometimes I just feel unwilling to talk to these people. Sometimes, I just want to be alone, quietly, without being forced to listen to their gossip or other useless words. ""Standing on a mountain high Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky I should go and see some friends But they don't really comprehend"" Jascha Richter expresses my feelings also."

Looking, like breathing, is natural; we do it without noticing it. Looking is passive--but seeing is active. Once you start seeing things you really begin to wake up.

When you are hunting for a job, you are supposed to _ .	Career building is an ongoing activity. Planning and goal setting are part of career building, but so is adjusting and taking advantage of things that happen in an unplanned way. Our dreams and desires, as well as the opportunities open to us, are changing all the time. Sometimes, they can change dramatically over a short period of time. Dealing with change often requires taking your career in a different direction. Therefore, most people's career paths wind up looking more like a forest path or the course of a river than a straight flight path from point A to Point B. Career paths tend to _ . Just as a river must take an indirect path to get round hills and other obstacles , we often have to do a little meandering to get round barries. We also meander simply to explore various career posibilities. This doesn't mean that you should wander aimlessly for the rest of your life! It doesn't mean that, although career building gives you an overall sense of direction, it is responsible to expect that you'll have to take some meandering along the way. Career building involves maneuvering as well as meandering. To maneuver is to be focused and strategic , to decide what you want and how you are going to get there. Believe it or not, you can maneuver and meander at the same time. In fact, you have probably already done so. For example, if you have ever sent in an application form for an education program or job before you are really sure you want your application to be accepted, you have taken action on a plan while you are still exploring other posibilities. In other words, you are maneuvering and meandering at the same time.	['know your goal and try all possible ways to achieve it']
What is the purpose of this text?	"One in ten teens says they use""study drugs""to improve their performance in school. So-called ""study drugs""refer to prescription medicines that are used to treat ADHD .But most parents have no understanding of the problem, a new study finds. In January, 2013, researchers from the University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital did a national survey of more than seven hundred families with teens. They found that only one percent of parents believe their child has taken a study drug. Yet in a 2012 University of Michigan study, ten percent of second-year high school students and twelve percent of third-year high school students say they use a study drug. The misuse of study drugs didn't come to the attention of almost all parents.""What we found in this survey is a clear mismatch ,""said Dr. Matthew Davis, one of the researchers. It is a mismatch between what parents believed and what their kids were reporting. ""We know teens are spreading the word that these drugs can improve their grades,""Davis said.""But these prescription medicines are drugs. And teens who use them without a prescription are taking a serious risk."" The new survey showed that fifty-four percent of white parents were""very concerned""about their child taking study drugs, compared with thirty-eight percent of Hispanic parents and thirty-seven percent of black parents. However, just twenty-seven percent of parents surveyed have talked to their teens about using study drugs. Of these parents, forty-one percent were black, twenty-seven percent were white and seventeen percent were Hispanic. Students with a prescription for an ADHD drug should be required to keep their medicines in a safe place, such as the school nurse's office. Seventy-nine percent of parents think so, the survey shows. This may help prevent _ from being shared or used by other students."	['To report a research result']
Which of the following is true	"I Have to See Another Doctor Mr. Clarke lives at the foot of the mountain. He keeps the forest for a rich farmer there. The only road to the forest is just in front of his house. He can easily see the people who want to enter the forest. Sometimes he has to be on duty at night. When he hears some sound, he has to get up to see if someone cuts the trees. One day he bought something in the town. He found a strong dog and bought it.

The hippo in this story _ .	Once upon a time,a hippo lived in a river next to a big tree. One day,a bird came and nested in the tree.The songs of the bird filled the hippo with so much envy that he couldn't think of anything else.Every day he would think why he wasn't born to be a bird even though the bird told him many times he was so lucky to be so big and such a good swimmer. Finally,the hippo made up his mind that he would come out of the river,climb the tree and start singing.However,when he tried to climb the tree,it was very clear that the hippo didn't have wings,nor claws to climb with. Realizing that he would never climb up the tree,he angrily hit the tree until it came crashing to the ground.Then he stepped onto the leaves of the fallen tree,and began singing. Unfortunately,hippos can't sing,either.All that came from his mouth were terrible noises,and when the other animals heard this,they all came around to make fun of the hippo. He was so ashamed by this.He also felt bad about having knocked the tree over.He used all his strength to raise the tree back up again,and look after it until it completely recovered. .

Why did the author follow the old man and the girl?	"Today, I felt terrible. My head was full of problems, burdens and confusion. I decided to take a walk even though I didn't know where I would go. The most extraordinary thing happened when I was on this walk. I saw an old man sitting on a chair. He was a seller of second-hand shoes. I thought he looked at least seventy years old. He seemed so tired and nobody was buying his shoes. I wanted to give him something but I had not brought anything with me. Then, a little girl came toward him. I heard the child say, ""Grandfather, may I polish your shoes?"" That old man took pity on her and he gave her a shoe to polish. The girl said, ""I polish the shoe because I need money to buy my brother a new school uniform."" I heard this and tears came to my eyes. The old man answered, ""Oh, little girl. Just stop doing this. Come with me and I will buy you a school uniform."" Then they walked to a market and I followed them behind. There he bought her a school uniform. The girl said, ""Thank you so much for doing this. May God bless you."" Then she left, leaving the old man smiling. He walked away from the market, but I stopped him. I whispered in his ear, ""You are a hero! Thank you for your kindness!"" As I walked away, I glanced back and I could see him still smiling. My own sadness disappeared and was chased away by the light of this kind act. I began realizing that I have a lot to be thankful for. I hope, some day, I can show my appreciation of what I have by following the example of the old man who only had a little, but shared it beautifully with someone who had nothing."

The officer studied in this school when he was _ .	"A 50-year-old American officer came back to his school. The teacher asked him to give a talk to the small boys and girls there. The talk was about the love of their great country. All the little ones were sitting in a large meeting-room. The old officer went up and began speaking. He said , "" Boys and girls . I studied in this school forty years ago. When I was your age, we were not as happy as you are today. Think about it and answer me, why are you so happy now?"" No sound came from the children. The old man waited for a long time. Then a short boy in the front put up his small dirty hand. ""Good boy! Please answer me, dear."" said the officer. With a big smile on his face, the boy stood up and said, ""If you speak long enough, we won't have Maths and biology lessons this morning."""	['ten']
In Para. 5, the author emphasized the importance of _ .	"How to improve our life? Many people think that they have to accept whatever life throws at them. They'll say, ""This is my destiny .I cannot change it."" Of course not! You don't have to suffer needlessly. Your life depends on you, not on any other external factor. I know a woman who says she just accepts what life gives her because she has done everything she can to improve it. Guess what her lifestyle is? She wakes up in the morning, goes to work, comes back home, relaxes, chats with people, watches TV, and then goes to sleep. Next day, the same routine cycle follows. Huh! Is this what she calls ""doing her best""? She believes she has tried her best and just accepts it in her heart that this is the life that has been intended for her and that her luck can only change if God wills it. She hasn't realized that we have to do our share of making the effort to live the life of our dreams. Remember that you harvest what you sow. You have to get off the sofa, get your eyes off the TV screen, get your hands off the phone(unless it contributes to your success),and get your mind and body to work! Don't expect your luck to change, unless you do something about it. If something goes wrong, don't just regard it as a temporary setback; instead, learn your lesson, make the most of the situation, and do something to solve the problem. It's not enough to think positively; you also have to act positively. If someone's life is in trouble, do you just hope and pray that things will turn out fine? Of course not! You get to do anything you can to save the person. So it is with your own life. It is not enough to hope for the best, but you have to do your best. In other words, don't just stand(or sit)there, do something to improve your life."	['positive action']
What's the writer's attitude towards kids pooling?	"Sharing cars to work is not unusual.But what about sharing time to raise children together? In Ningbo city of Zhejiang province in East China, young mothers in the same neighborhood pool their children together, and share the responsibility of being parents. Spending every day together, but not families - in this coastal city of East China, three mothers are trying a new way of raising their kids, by pooling them together. Among the mothers are both office workers and housewives.They say they do so not just because of the tight schedule. Jiujiu's mother said, ""By kids pooling, we mean to create an opportunity for the kids to spend time together so that we can observe our kids, learn more about them.And then we can discuss how to better bring them up."" The three families have been doing so for two years, in school days and holidays.Their children have grown used to each other's company, Chichi's mother said, ""My son was a bit shy.We've been talking him to be more active, but he hardly changed.After joining the kids pool, suddenly we found him willing to communicate with others now.When we are not there, he has to rely on himself to get along with his pals."" Generally, mothers speak highly about the pooling.The mothers describe the pooling as bringing the running water into a closed pond.It opens a window to a different world for both kids and parents.But there are moments when opinions differ.Xiaoxiao's mother said, ""Sex education for example.Kids will be curious about it when they reach a certain age.Personally I want to talk with my child about it, frankly and sincerely.But the other two moms think it better not to bring it up."" Xiaoxiao's mother says her solution is to share some parenting guidebooks with other mothers and let them make the decision. The headmaster of the kindergarten believes such pooling activities test not only children, but also the parents.Jin Hongqing, kindergarten headmaster said, ""Parents need to be tolerant and patient.They shouldn't play the blame game when kids fight with each other.It's better to let the kids solve the issue by themselves.What they can do as parents is to communicate."""

The only thing the writer knew that she _ .	"I was twenty years old, and my parents were looking forward to the day when I would be earning my own living. Unfortunately, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted my future occupation to be. The only thing I did know was that I did not want to spend the next 45 years teaching, being a nurse or sitting in an office. But that was before the postman delivered a catalogue of courses that were being offered at the local college. As I looked through it, I was attracted by a page that talked about the difficulties faced by deaf people in their everyday lives and how students could help by learning sign language. It went on to say that graduates of the course usually find work in different organizations, such as law companies, the Stock Exchange, insurance companies and banks. Then I saw something that really caught my eye: ""Singer"" are also needed for sporting events, concerts, theatrical performances and, believe it or not, circuses! By the time I got to the bottom of the page, I knew I had found the perfect occupation. I enrolled on the course, which to my parents' great delight was free of charge. The course was brilliant. My favourite part was the final lesson, when our teacher asked us to sign our favourite song. It was really difficult because not only did we have to sign the words, but we also had to find a way of showing whether the song was happy or sad and whether the beat was slow or fast. It was the hardest thing I have ever done--but also the most rewarding."	"[""had never liked being in a teacher's office""]"
Accordingto Sadia Vanjara, the pain is from _ ?	"Most children have heard their parents at one time or another yell ""sit up straight!"" or ""don't slouch!"" In the past, this was usually heard at the dinner table as children ate dinner. But these days, it is also heard around another activity-video games. Ten-year old Owaish Batliwala, from Mumbai, India, admits he spends three to four hours each day playing games on his tablet computer. His mother Mehzabin became concerned when her son started saying that his neck hurt. She said, ""My son started having neck problems around June or July. The pain slowly spread to his hand and his back. He plays for hours on the iPad and mobile phone. This is what has caused the problem."" Sadia Vanjara is a physical therapist. She says the number of young children with chronic pain in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the rise. Dr. Vanjara says the pain is not from aging, accidents or disease. It is from poor posture, or body position, while playing video games. ""They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, their age is like, under 10, they are not complaining, the blood reports are fine, their x-rays are fine, their MRI's are fine, then where is the culprit ? And that is the very common thing that is happening amongst all children and that is smart phones and the gadgets ."" This is a problem in many parts of the world. But there are more smartphone users in India than anywhere else in the world, except China. Networking equipment company Cisco estimates that the number of smartphone users in India will increase from 140 million today to 651 million by 2020. 19-year old student Nida Jameel says she feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smartphone most of the day. She says she uses her smartphone 24/7. This means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time. ""As I use phone 24/7 (all day) like, so probably yeah, it was because of the phone, continuous usage and Snapchat, Whatsapp, more and more you know social media coming, so like phone is the center of everything."" Dr. Vanjara says the best treatments for the pain are daily exercises. ""And start stretching it in all the possible directions that you can."" Correct posture can help prevent pain. Dr. Vanjara teaches children how to hold their gadgets correctly. She tells a patient to hold the gadget in front of the face. She says that bending the head down to look at the device, strains the neck and creates an unhealthy bend to the back. Sadia Vanjara predicts we will see not only physical but psychological and emotional problems resulting from overuse of gadgets. Experts advise taking breaks from using a computer or other device often. Stand up. Stretch your legs, back, shoulders and arms. And when your work or school work is done, unplug and exercise."

We can learn from the passage that _ .	"In 1989 an 8.2 earthquake almost flattened America, killing over 30,000 people in less than four minutes. A father rushed to the school where his son was supposed to be, only to discover that the building was as flat as a pancake. After the shock, he remembered the promise he had made to his son: ""No matter what happened, I'll always be there for you!"" And tears began to fill his eyes. As he looked at the pile of ruins that once was the school, it looked hopeless, but he kept remembering his promise to his son. Remembering his son's classroom would be in the back right corner of the building, he rushed there and started digging. Other parents tried to pull him off the ruins, saying: ""It's too late! _ 're all dead! You can't help!"" He replied, ""Are you going to help me now?"" The fire chief showed up and tried to pull him off the school's ruins saying, ""Fires are breaking out, explosions are happening everywhere. You're in danger. We'll take care of it. Go home."" This loving, caring American father asked, ""Are you going to help me now?"" The police came and said, ""You're, anxious and it's over. Go home. We'll handle it!"" He replied, ""Are you going to help me now?"" No one helped. Courageously he went on alone. He dug for eight hours...12 hours...24 hours...36 hours...then, in the 38th hour, he heard his son's voice. He screamed his son's name, ""ARMAND!"" He heard back, ""Dad! It's me, Dad! You promised no matter what happened, you would always be there for me! You did it, Dad!"" ""What's going on in there? How is it?"" the father asked. ""There are 14 of us left out of 33, Dad. "" ""Come out, boy!"" ""No, Dad! Let the other kids out first, because I know you'll get me! No matter what happens, I know you'll always be there for me!"""	['love can set us free from all fear and overcome the difficulties']
The writer thinks it _ for people to feel unhappy in time of difficulty.	If practicing an attitude of gratitude during the storms of life is too much for you right now, that's OK. When things are tough, most people have a hard time being thankful. They're so caught up in what's wrong in the present moment that they simply can't see some things are still right. If that's true for you, then accept it. You're going through a particularly difficult or unhappy period of time, and you don't like it one bit. Very normal, very human. But remember this: there is always something to be grateful for. It maybe only a small comfort right now, but it is a start. Make a list of some of the terrible things that didn't happen. For example: *You're in debt...but you're not homeless. *You lost your job...but you didn't lose your health. *You broke your leg...but you didn't break your neck. *Your mother has Alzheimer's disease...but your father doesn't. No matter how bad things are, they could always be worse. Start finding gratitude for what might have happened, but didn't. It does help a lot. Of course, you may not be thankful for everything-- but you can always be thankful for something.	['understandable']
What do we know about Samake and her family?	"""To educate a girl is to educate a thousand people,"" says Maimouna Samake, a mother of six children(including five girls). ""If you put one seed in the ground and rain comes, it will grow to produce many seeds."" Samake, one of 2,000 residents, lives in a small village, Sounkala, in one of the world's poorest countries. Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help. Samake hasn't been to school, but she wants a better future for her five daughters, including Ramatou, 12, and Mariam, 10. ""When a woman attends school, she will teach what she learns to her children,"" said Ramatou, who wants to become a doctor. ""She will also know how to take better care of her family."" Build On tries to build schools for grades one to three. If things go well over those three years, they return to help build another school for grades four to six, and then set up evening adult literacy classes. Ramatou and Mariam will not learn inside the walls of build On school since they are already in the sixth grade, but Samake hopes that they will be able to attend evening classes to continue learning."

Which word can be used to describe my true feeling at the scene of the hunting?	"When I was two years old, something happened which I have never forgotten. It was early spring, and there was a light mist over the trees and fields. The other young fellows and I were feeding at the lower end of the field when we heard the distant cry of dogs. The oldest among us lifted his head to listen. ""There are the hounds "", he said, and immediately raced off. The rest of us followed him to the top of the field where we could see several fields beyond. Soon the dogs were all racing down the field next to ours, making a loud ""yoyoyoyo"" sound. After then came men on horses, some in green coats. Suddenly, the dogs became silent and ran around with their noses to the ground. ""They've lost the smell of the hare."" said the old horse. ""Perhaps it will escape."" But the dogs began their ""yoyoyoyo"" again and came at full speed towards our field. Just then a hare, wild with fear, ran towards the trees. The dogs jumped over the stream and ran across the field, followed by the huntsmen. Six or eight jumped their horses over the stream, close behind the dogs. Before the hare could get away, the dogs were upon her with wild cries. We heard a terrible scream, and that was the end of the hare. One of the men picked her up and held her by the leg. She was covered in blood, but all the huntsmen seemed pleased. I was so greatly surprised that at first I did not see what was happening by the stream but when I did look, I saw a sad sight. Two fine horses were down, one in the stream struggling to stand up and the other on the grass with one of his legs broken. One rider, who seemed unhurt, was climbing out of the water, but the other lay quite still. ""His neck is broken,"" said my mother. ""I can't understand why men are so fond of this sport. They often hurt themselves and ruin good horses, all for one hare that they could get more easily in other ways. But we are only horses, and don't know why men do these things."" They carried the dead rider to our master's house, and then came back to the black horse on the grass. The animal was in great pain and one of his legs was broken. Someone ran to our master's house and came back to the horse with a gun. Soon after there was a loud bang and a terrible cry, and the black horse did not move any more."	['Sad.']

His job filled his day, his thought, his life. While he woke up and took a warm shower, I screamed under a freezing waterfall Peru. While he tied a tie and put on the same Swiss watch, I rowed a boat across Lake of the Ozarks. My father sees me drfting aimlessly, nothing to show for my 33 years but a passport full of funny stamps. He wants me to settle down, but now I want him to find an adventure. He agrees to travel with me through the national parks. We meet four weeks later in Rapid City. "" What is our first stop?"" asks my father. ""What time is it?"" ""Still don't have a watch?"" Less than an hour away is Mount Rushmore. As he stares up at the four Presidents carved in granite , his mouth and eyes open slowly, like those of little boy. ""Unbelievable,"" he says, ""How was this done?"" A film in the information center shows sculptor Gutzon Borglum devoted 14 years to the sculpture and then left the final touches to his son. We stare up and I ask myself, Would I ever devote my life to anything? No directions, ...... I always used to hear those words in my father's voice. Now I hear them in my own. The next day we're at Yellowstone National Park, where we have a picnic. ""Did you ever travel with your dad? I ask. ""Only once,"" he says. "" I never spoke much with my father. We loved each other---but never said it. Whatever he could give me, he gave.""> In Glacier National Park, my father says, ""I've never seen water so blue.""

According to the passage ,the best way for children to learn things is by _	Let children learn to judge their own work. A child learning to talk does not learn by being corrected all the time :if corrected too much, he will stop talking. He notices a thousand times a day the difference between the language he uses and the language those Around him use. Bit by bit .he makes the necessary changes to make his language like other people's. In the same way, children learn to do all the other things: they should learn to do without being taught, such as to walk, run, climb, whistle, ride a bicycle--compare their own performances with those of more skilled people, and slowly make the needed changes. But in school we never give a child a chance to find out his mistakes and correct them for himself. We do it all for him. We act as if we thought that he would never notice a mistake unless it was pointed out to him, or correct it unless he was made to .Let him work out, with the help of other children if he wants it, what this word says, what the answer is to that problem, whether this is a good way of saying or doing this or not. If it is a matter of right answer, as it may be in mathematics or science, give him the answer book. Let him correct his own papers. Why should we teachers waste time on such routine work? Our job should be to help the child when he tells us that he can't find the way to get the right answer .Let the children learn what all educated persons must some day learn ,how to measure their own understanding, how to know what they know or do not know.

How many examples does the author offer to describe the future life?	"When a magazine for high school students asked its readers what life would be like in twenty years, they said: Machines would be run by solar power. Buildings would rotate so they could follow the sun to take maximum advantage of its light and heat. Walls would ""give light"" and ""change color with the push of a button."" Food would be replaced by pills. School would be taught by electrical impulse while we sleep. Cars would have radar . Does this sound like the year 2000? Actually, this article was written in 1958 and the question was, ""what will life be like in 1978? The future is much too important to simply guess about, the way the high school students did, so experts are regularly asked to predict accuately. By carefully studying the present, skilled businessmen, scientists, and politicians are supposedly able to figure out in advance what will happen. But can they? One expert on Cities wrote: Cities of the future would not be crowded, but would have space for farms and fields. People would travel to work in ""airbuses"", large all-weather helicopters carrying up to 200 passengers. When a person left the airbus station he could drive a coin-operated car equipped with radar. The radar equipment of cars would make traffic accidents ""almost unheard of"". Does that sound familiar? If the expert had been accurate it would, because he was writing in 1957. His subject was ""The city of 1982"". If the professionals sometimes sound like high school students, it's probably because future study is still a new field. But economic forecasting, or predicting what the economy will do, has been around for a long time. It should be accuate, and generally it is. But there have been some big mistakes in the field, too. In early 1929, most forecasters saw an excellent future for the stock market. In October of that year, the stock market had its worst losses ever, ruining thousands of investors who had put their faith in financial foreseers. One forecaster knew that predictions about the future would always be subject to significant error. In 1957, H.J. Rand of the Rad corporation was asked about the year 2000, ""Only one thing is certain,"" he answered. ""Children born today will have reached the age of 43."""	['Four']
Which of the following is TRUE?	The most famous statue-the Sphinx in Egypt has been damaged. The experts are trying to find out the cause to protect it. As we all know, the Sphinx has the body of a lion and the face of a man. It was cut from limestone near Egypt's pyramids about 4, 500 years ago. Not long ago a large piece of stone fell from the Sphinx's right shoulder. In order to protect the statue from more harm, a computer was placed on it to measure rainfall, wind speed and air temperature. The computer also measured the amount of water and air pollution, the direction of wind and the temperature of the statue itself. The effects of age, wind, water and pollution have greatly weakened the Sphinx. Sunlight, wind, water and pollution have been eroding the outside of the statue for centuries. The experts hope that the information from the computer will help protect it from more damage. They say the more they know about what is destroying the Sphinx, the more they can do to protect it.	['The Sphinx is made of a kind of rock, which can be destroyed by wind, rain and so on.']
What does this reading tell about potatoes? It tells us _ .	Most American children eat potatoes every day, but they don't know which part of potato is most nourishing .Take a sharp knife and cut a very thin slice from it and hold it to the light, and you will see that the potato has skin, an outside rim and the inner part. The outside rim which is right under the skin is most nutritious.But this part is often thrown away with the skin. Even the skin itself is better for food than the inside. When eating a cooked potato, if you choose the inside and leave the outside, you are wasting the best part of it. If you can't eat the whole potato, it is better to eat the outside rim and leave the inner part.	['how to eat them']
We learn from the passage that animal clones are likely to have _ .	"Scientist Says 'No' to Human Cloning ""I've never met a human worth cloning,"" says cloning expert Mark Westhusin from his lab at Texas A&M University. ""It's a stupid endeavor."" That's an interesting choice of adjective, coming from a man who has spent millions of dollars trying to clone a 13-year-old dog named Missy. So far, he and his team have not succeeded, though they have cloned two cows and a cat. They just might succeed in cloning Missy soon -- or perhaps not for another five years. Westhusin's experience with cloning animals leaves him upset by all this talk of human cloning. In three years of work on the Missy project, using hundreds upon hundreds of dog's eggs, the A&M team has produced only a dozen or so embryos carrying Missy's DNA. None have survived the transfer to a surrogate mother. The wastage of eggs and the many spontaneously aborted(,) fetuses may be acceptable when you're dealing with cats or bulls, he argues, but not with humans. ""Cloning is incredibly inefficient, and also dangerous,"" he says. Even so, dog cloning is a commercial opportunity, with a nice research payoff. Ever since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1997, Westhusin's phone has been ringing with people calling in hopes of duplicating their cats and dogs, cattle and horses. ""A lot of people want to clone pets, especially if the price is right,"" says Westhusin. Cost is no obstacle for Missy's mysterious billionaire owner; he's put up $3.7 million so far to fund A&M's research. Contrary to some media reports, Missy is not dead. The owner wants a twin to carry on Missy's fine qualities after she does die. The prototype(;)is, by all accounts, athletic, good-natured and supersmart. Missy's master does not expect an exact copy of her. He knows her clone may not have her temperament(, ). In a statement of purpose, Missy's owner and the A&M team say they are ""both looking forward to studying the ways that her clones differ from Missy."" Besides cloning a great dog, the project may contribute insight into the old question of nature vs. nurture. It could also lead to the cloning of special rescue dogs and many endangered animals. However, Westhusin is cautious about his work. He knows that even if he gets a dog pregnant, the offspring, should they survive, will face the problems shown at birth by other cloned animals: abnormalities like immature lungs and heart and weight problems~ ""Why would you ever want to clone humans,"" Westhusin asks, ""when we're not even close to getting it worked out in animals yet?"""

Louis Braille developed an alphabet for blind people after he _ .	"Louis Braille, Alphabet Maker Blind people can read. They do so by running their fingers along a line of raised points or dots on paper. Of course, they first have to learn the code. Here are some examples of it. One dot stands for the letter ""A."" Two dots side by side mean ""C."" Four dots arranged to look like a box (: :) stand for the letter ""G."" By placing the dots in special patterns, all the letters of the alphabet can be formed. This code was made up by a Frenchman called Louis Braille. Though he could see at birth, he became sightless when he was only three. Braille was cutting leather in his father's shop. His knife slipped and cut his eye. Infection spread to both eyes, and he became blind. At 10, he was placed in a home for the blind. But young Louis had great talent. He became a skilled musician and soon got a job as a church organist in Paris. Because he had talent and was quick, he became a teacher at a school for the blind. While there, he heard that an army captain had sent messages to his gun crews so they could read them at night without light. His messages were in the simple form of raised dots and dashes. This was the clue Louis needed. At the age of 15, he worked out his own six-dot code. Each group of dots is called a cell. The cells are three dots high and two dots wide. For the rest of his life, Braille taught his young flock to read both written and musical works using his code. For the last 17 years of his life, Braille was ill with tuberculosis . He died at the age of 43. France honored him by placing his remains in the famous Pantheon in Paris."	['learned that soldiers could read messages from raised dots.']

Columbus' journals told us that in Bermuda _ .	"We like to consider ourselves the superior race, and we are. It's true that we are getting to know more and more, and we actually live in ""the information age"". Our human vanity makes us believe that we really have to know everything! Surprisingly, we do not have this ability. The question ""what is happening in the Bermuda Triangle"" is the very proof. Where is the Bermuda Triangle located? The mysterious triangle is believed to be situated between Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico, where too many unusual events have happened. On December the 5th1945, five U.S. military planes took off from Florida on a clear day only to disappear over Bermuda. Furthermore, some other disappearances took place; in 1947, an American C54 plane simply disappeared at 100 miles from Bermuda; at 80 miles, a Star Tiger plane disappeared in 1948. Even Columbus had trouble in Bermuda. Some of his journals were about the strange happenings there: ""the waters are changing their colors"" and ""compasses are going wild"". Maybe it's why it is called the Devil's triangle or the Atlantic cemetery. Many _ were stated in order to explain the strange events. In spite of these attempts, the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle remains unsolved. Some people get to say that maybe aliens are involved in it. Other imaginative scientists relate the happenings in Bermuda to Einstein's theory, saying that the missing ships and planes are translated to another dimension of space and time and taken into another world. Maybe we will just have to wait to go to Heaven and ask the One who made it. The answer will surely be a satisfying one!"	['there were some strange happenings']
BBC School Report started its first worldwide radio bulletin in _	"School Report went international when the BBC News project's first global radio bulletin was made at Randfontein High School in South Africa. Students from the school were joined by pupils from two other schools--Parktown High School for Girls and Impala Crescent Primary School--and went live at 14:00 local time on 3 February, 2010. BBC producers Ros Smith and Kate Riley were invited to work with the schools. After deciding on their news topics, the students gathered vox pops from fellow students and their teachers. Tiffany said, ""We had a chance to talk to other kids from other schools. This was great because Randfontein is a place which is not known to many people and away from modern civilization."" Nomakhosi added, ""Interviewing our teachers and classmates was interesting and I felt important while doing this."" Chene commented, ""My voice sounded like a whole new person. It takes some time to get used to hearing your own voice."" Pupils, known as learners in South Africa, then worked with School Report producer Ros Smith to edit their audio material while others started script-writhing . With the 14:00 deadline fast approaching, and the audio edited, the new School Reporters recorded their scripts so they could be added to the bulletin. Ros Smith was really impressed with the students' work. She said, ""The stories they chose were an excellent mix. The final bulletin sounds really good, and they finished with 10 minutes to spare before the deadline."" On 26 March students from the three schools took part in the School Report News Day with support from the Open Learning Systems Education Trust, and it was a big success."	['Randfontein High School']
What can we infer from the passage?	"For the first time in Hong Kong's history,an entertainer has been written into middle school textbooks. He is considered one of the best actors in Hong Kong. Yes,he is Chow Yun fat. The example of his long hard struggle for success has been used in a chapter in a Hong Kong middle school textbook.Using his experience,students can learn to make the most of their time and to grab every opportunity to succeed. On hearing about this,Chow said happily,""I really hope that my experiences can make young people understand that one should not be afraid of difficulties and setbacks ,for they are the only way to success."" Indeed,Chow has travelled a long and difficult path to reach his success.In 1955,he was born into a poor family in Hong Kong. When he was 17,he had to leave school.He worked in a number of jobs--as a postman,camera salesman and taxi driver. These experiences paved the way for him to play all kinds of roles later in life. Chow broke into the film industry in the late 1970s. He was one of the hardest working actors and starred in a number of popular TV dramas and films including ""Shanghai Bund""(<<>> ) and ""A Better Tomorrow"". Since 1985, he has won many awards including Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards and Hong Kong Film Awards . In 1995, he went to Hollywood. Although he was already in his 40s, he had to learn English.He even put chopsticks in his mouth to practise pronouncing certain sounds. His film, ""Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon"",began to gain him more fame and recognition around the world.In 1998,the mayor of Chicago set aside January 12 as ""Chow Yun fat Day."""

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Michael wanted to make some money to buy a new computer game, but he did not know how. So he went to ask his brother Greg for help. ""I think you could help to wash Mom's and Dad's cars,"" Greg said, ""Some of the neighbors could pay you to wash theirs, too. It's getting colder and no one wants to wash the cars themselves."" Michael agreed, but he shivered at the thought of washing cars and getting wet in cold weather.""Maybe this isn't a good idea."" ""Don't worry,"" Greg said. ""I have some golf gloves .You can use them to wash cars. and I will even help you to wash the cars.""""Thank you!""Michael said. After spending the day washing cars, Michael got enough money and went to the store with Greg. He found the game he wanted quickly, but as he took it off the shelf he saw a golf video game next to it. He knew Greg loved golf and wouldn't play golf in winter, so he put his game back and decided to buy the golf video game. ""What are you doing?"" Greg asked. ""I thought this game would be more fun."" said Michael. ""We can play it together."""	['Michael bought a golf video game for his brother and himself.']
The McGarity girl is characterized as _ .	They think they're lucky that they're living and it's Christmas again. They can't see that we live on a dirty street in a shabby house among people who aren't much good. Johnny and the children can't see how pitiful it is that our neighbors have to make happiness out of this filth and dirt. My children must get out of this. But how? The money that we've saved isn't nearly enough. The McGaritys have money, but they are show-offs with it. The McGarity girl just yesterday stood out there in the street eating from a bag of cookies while a ring of hungry children watched her. I saw those children looking at her and crying in their hearts, and when she couldn't eat any more, she shrew the rest down the sewer . Miss Jackson who teaches at the Settlement House isn't rich, but she knows things. She understands people. Her eyes look straight into yours when she talks with you. Everybody else here looks away because they're ashamed of their lives. I'd like to see the children be like Miss Jackson when they grew up.	['selfish and cruel']

Through the years,things didn't improve a bit.We could not lie in bed ""sick"" like our friends did in order to miss school. My mother was the unkindest mother.Out of four children,a couple of us went on to higher education.None of us have ever done bad things.She forced us to grow up into educated and honest people.I am trying to raise my three children like this.I will feel proud when my children call me unkind.Because you see,I am thankful that I had the unkindest mother in the whole world."

How long has the band Maroon 5 been around under this name?	"We're unleashing the five most popular songs in the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart, for the week ending November 15, 2014. We don't get any new songs this week...but things do get shaken up a bit. It all starts in fifth place, where Jessie J, Ariana Grande, and Nicki Minaj dip a notch with ""Bang Bang."" Jessie says she wanted to assemble this lineup for a long time - she says she only met the other two after the song went to number one on iTunes. Jessie also says she wanted to use Nicki five years ago on her debut single, ""Do It Like A Dude."" Taking over fourth place is Maroon 5 with ""Animals."" This band has been around for 20 years...but not always under this name. The Los Angeles group formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers, and released one album under that name in 1997. Four years later the members re-grouped as Maroon 5, and the rest is chart history. Holding in third place is Tove Lo with ""Habits (Stay High)."" Where did that name come from? This Swedish artist's real name is Ebba Tove Elsa Nillson. ""Lo"" is Swedish for lynx - a species of wildcat that Tove says she fell in love with as a little girl. After eight weeks, Meghan Trainor falls off the Hot 100 pedestal: ""All About That Bass"" falls to second place. Last week, she and Miranda Lambert sang this song at the Country Music Association Awards in Nashville, and Meghan kicks off a headlining North American tour next February in Vancouver, Canada. Taylor Swift re-takes the Hot 100 title, with ""Shake It Off"" - giving her three total weeks at the top - but that's only the beginning of her phenomenal week. Taylor's 1989 album just opened at number one by selling 1.2 million domestic copies. That's the largest sales week since The Eminem Show sold 1.3 million copies, way back in 2002. That's a wrap for this week, but as you know, the chart is always changing. Come back in seven days for an all-new lineup."	['13']
Why did the writer let the children in?	"It was Thanksgiving morning and in the crowded kitchen of my small home I was busy preparing the traditional Thanksgiving turkey when the doorbell rang. I opened the front door and saw two small children in rags huddling together. ""Any old papers, lady?"" asked one of them. I was busy. I wanted to say ""no"" until I looked down at their feet. They were wearing thin little sandals, wet with heavy snow. ""Come in and I'll make you a cup of hot cocoa."" They walked over and sat down at the table. Their wet sandals left marks upon the floor. I served them cocoa and bread with jam to fight against the cold outside. Then I went back to the kitchen and started again on my household budget. The silence in the front room struck me. I looked in. The girl held the empty cup in her hands, looking at it. The boy asked in a flat voice, ""Lady, are you rich?"" I looked at my shabby slipcovers. The girl put her cup back in its saucer carefully and said, ""Your cups match your saucers."" Her voice was hungry with a need that no amount of food could supply. They left after that, holding their bundles of papers against the wind. They hadn't said ""Thank you."" They didn't need to. They had reminded me that I had so much for which to be grateful. Plain blue china cups and saucers were only worth five pence. But they matched. I tasted the potatoes and stirred the meat soup. Potatoes and brown meat soup, a roof over our heads, my man with a good steady job--these matched, too. I moved the chairs back from the fire and cleaned the living room. The muddy prints of small sandals were still wet upon my floor. Let them be for a while, I thought, just in case I should begin to forget how rich I am."	['She showed great pity on them']
_ wants to be a teacher.	Young American Volunteers If you have no special plans for your holiday, why not spend your time helping others? Don't listen to people who say that young people today often think only of themselves. It's not true at all. More and more young people in the USA volunteer to spend their school holidays working for others. And they don't do it for money. Here are some of their stories. Alice Hamilton, 17 I'm going to help the Forest Center build new hiking paths in the mountains. It's going to be terrific - I'll spend the whole summer living in a tent and breathing the clean mountain air. I'm going to sleep under the stars. It will be a nice sport, and I'll be able to do something good at the same time! Jason Moore, 18 This summer, I'm going to volunteer with Special House Program. They build good, low-cost houses and sell them to the families that are not very rich. They'll teach me what to do, so I'll help people and also have a chance to learn how to build houses. Trish Anderson, 16 I'm going to teach kids who have trouble reading. I'll work for a program called Reading For Life. Every day, I'm going to help kids choose and read books that they like. I want to be a teacher and I love children and reading, so this is going to be a great experience for me. .	['Trish Anderson']
What is the best title of the passage?	"According to a report by London's Sunday Times on December 24, 2011, the world's youngest professional gamer is an 8-year -old American boy, Victor De Leon.

The girl refused to ask for help because she thought _ .	"I was blind, but I was ashamed of it if it was known. I refused to use a white stick and hated asking for help. After all, I was a teenager girl, and I couldn't bear people to look at me and think I was not like them. I must have been a terrible danger on the roads, coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there were all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work. One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something,""I'm awfully sorry,""I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost. This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn't stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off. No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived. Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound. Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help. But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; It seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus. Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did. But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by. I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one. Then I gave up. I decided to walk on to the next stop."	['being fond blind was embarrassing']
What's the writer's purpose of telling his own experience with his first wife?	Facing fear is one of the most important things you can do. Some people have a fear of failure and others a fear of success. It may seem strange but neither one is a good fear. You might think the fear of failure could be a good thing but it's not, particularly if the fear of failure keeps you from accomplishing anything. For myself, I have a huge fear of failure but I am good at facing that fear and overcoming it. I don't let my fear of failure cause me to delay my decision or get me off the track. I use the fear to make sure I'm doing my absolute best at all times because I know if I don't do my best I will fail. That frightens me. I'm not afraid of trying at all. I started a business when I was married to my first wife. The business became successful and I was getting ready to make some huge money. However, my wife just wanted us to stay small because she was comfortable there. She feared what success might bring and did every little thing she could to make sure we didn't grow any bigger. I'm sure you can see the problem. I had a fear of failure and she had an even bigger fear of success. Finally I couldn't stand any more of her fear and we got a divorce. Facing fear and overcoming fear is very important. People even have a fear of fear. I'm sure that it is normal. People fear change more than anything else and fight that change with fear. They fear what they don't know or understand. They fear anything new to them. But we need to keep in mind that the world is changing all the time and that change is inevitable . You can live a life free of fear by learning to face your fears.	['To explain two kinds of fears.']
After Jack had his hair cut, he thought _ .	"Jack went to a barber's shop and had his hair cut, but when he came out, he was not happy with the result . When his friend Bob saw him, he laughed and said, ""What has happened to your hair, Jack?"" Jack said, ""I tried a new barber's shop today, because I wasn't quite satisfied with my old one, but this one seems even worse."" Bob agreed . ""Yes, I think you're right, Jack. Now I'll tell you what to do when you go into a barber's shop next time: look at all the barber's hair, find out whose hair looks worst, and then go straight to him."" ""Why shall I go to him?"" Jack asked. ""But that would be foolish!"" ""Oh, no, it wouldn't,"" answered Bob. ""Who cut that man's hair? Just think it. He couldn't cut it himself, could he? Another of the barbers cut it. So you know he can't be the worst barber."""	"[""the new barber's shop was worse than the old one""]"
What's the passage mainly about?	"Are you an optimist? Do you look at your glass and see it as half full? Do you believe that every cloud has a silver lining and that things generally turn out for the best? Do you believe that if something is meant to be, it will be? If you reply ""yes"" to all of these questions, then you are an optimist. You probably are enthusiastic, cheerful and outgoing. You may be successful at work and in love. But you may be misguided because things don't turn out for the best. You may believe that when one door closes another one opens (for example, you may fail to obtain a new job; another chance will come around soon). Wrong. When one door closes, another door slams in your face. That's bitter reality. Now a book has been published which confirms what pessimists have suspected all along. It's called The Positive Power of Defensive Pessimism. Its author argues that defensive pessimism can lead to positive results. Defensive pessimism is a strategy used to manage fear, anxiety and worry. Defensive pessimists prepare for the things by setting low outcomes for themselves. They carefully consider everything that may go wrong and plan for ways to handle these problems. And this gives them a sense of control. Lawrence Sanno, a psychology professor, says, ""What's interesting about defensive pessimists is that they tend to be very successful people, so their low opinion of the situation's outcomes is not realistic. They use it to motivate themselves to perform better."" So far, so good. _ . Defensive pessimists prepare carefully and consider what might go wrong, whether at work, on date or even in a sports game. It makes sense to have a back-up plan. There are many sayings in English urging caution. For example, ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket."" And ""Don't count your chickens until they hatch."" To have a confident and optimistic approach to life's problems is good. But listen to what Woody Alien, the American comedian says, ""Confidence is what you have before you understand the problem."" There are pros and cons to being an optimist and a pessimist. Don't feel bad if you see the glass half empty. You are a realist. But lighten up and hook up with someone who sees the same glass half full."	['The benefits of defensive pessimism.']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Greeks play a special game at Easter and it's good fun! The rules of the game are as follows: 1.Everyone picks out a hard-boiled Waster Egg.2.Each player finds a partner.One person will be a ""holder"", and the other will be a ""tapper"".Holders should hold the egg with either the pointy end or the round end facing up.Tappers should hold the egg with that same end facing down.Tapping must be done pointy-end-to-pointy-end or round-end-to-round-end.3.With one good tap, the tapper tries to crack the holder's egg.One player will end up with a cracked egg.4.Each player finds another partner and repeats steps 2 and 3.(After one end of the egg is cracked, players may continue to play using the uncracked end).5.A player loses when both ends of his egg have been cracked.The winner is the person who still has an uncracked egg.6.Enjoy eating the eggs! Dye your Easter eggs.With an adult's help, dye hard-boiled eggs red using food coloring or egg dye.For a nice sheen, use a paper towel to rub some oil on each egg.But don't use too much oil---you wouldn't want your egg to slide out of your hand when you play the egg-cracking game! Why dye eggs red? Eggs represent new life and the red dye symbolizes the pain and suffering in the past. Why crack eggs? Some say that the cracking of the eggs symbolizes a wish to break away from human misery and enter the new life."	"[""It's said that the broken eggs represent the wish to lead a new life""]"
What can you infer from the passage?	"British Summer Time runs from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October. In the depths of winter the nights in the UK are anything from 15-19 hours long. Longer nights mean frost and fog are more likely to form. Twice a year the clocks change, forward in the spring and then back again in the autumn. But why? It happens twice a year. We all change our clocks and watches by one hour. In the spring, we add an hour, and go onto what is called British Summer Time, while in the autumn, we do the reverse, and return to Greenwich Mean Time. Why bother? It's all to do with saving the hours of daylight, and was started by a guy called William Willett, a London builder, who lived in Petts Wood in Kent. Basically, he figured that you could improve the population's health and happiness by putting forward the clocks by twenty minutes every Sunday in April and do the opposite in September. Economics His idea was not taken up, even though a ""Daylight Saving Bill"" was introduced some five years before the outbreak of World War One. But once the war started, it was considered wise to economics, to promote greater efficiency in using daylight hours, and in the use of artificial lighting. And so in 1916, ""Daylight Saving Time"" was introduced. Even though most countries abandoned this after that war, some eventually decided that it was a good idea, and most of these nations began to keep it throughout the year. Experiment Since 1972, Britain has decided to go with Greenwich Mean Time in winter, and British Summer Time in Summer. But back in 1968, Britain tried a four-year experiment by advancing time one hour ahead of GMT throughout the year. But those living further north, particularly in Scotland, found it most unsatisfactory, with dark mornings for much of the year, and the experiment was dropped."	['The idea of changing the clocks suffered disagreement.']
Which of the following is true of Nick White?	"Many of us use them several times a day without really noticing. And yet the way we behave in lifts, or elevators as they are known in the US, reveals a hidden anxiety. Passengers seem to know instinctively how to arrange themselves in an elevator, like the dots on a die. With each additional passenger, the bodies shift, going into the open spaces. On your own, you can do whatever you want--it's your own little box. If there are two of you, you take different corners, creating the greatest distance. When a third person enters, you will unconsciously form a triangle. And when there is a square, with someone in every corner, a fifth person is probable going to have to stand in the middle. Why are we so awkward in lifts? ""You don't have enough space,"" says Professor Babette Renneberg, a clinical psychologist at the Free University of Berlin. ""Usually when we meet other people we have about an arm's length of distance between us. And that's not possible in most elevators, so it's a very unusual setting. It's unnatural."" But perhaps there is more to it than just social awkwardness. ""In the back of our minds we are a little anxious,"" says Nick White, an officer in New York who was unfortunate enough to be trapped in a lift for 41 hours. ""We don't like to be locked into a place. We want to get out of the elevator as soon as possible, you know, it's a frightening place to be."" During his terrible experience, he began to think of another enclosed space--a tomb. Dr. Lee Gray agrees that a sense of powerlessness is the main cause of lift anxiety. ""You're in a machine that's moving, over which you have no control. You cannot see the elevator engine, you don't know how it's working."" he says."	['He was trapped in a lift for 41 hours.']
The dog looked _ .	"One day when Jack was walking inthe park, he saw a woman he knew sitting on a bench with a dog beside her. The dog was looking up at the woman. Jack walked up to the woman and said, ""Hello. Sue, how are you? May I sit and talk with you for a while?"" ""Of course, please sit down,""Sue said. Jack sat down next to Sue on the bench, and they talked quietly together. The dog continued to look up at Sue, as if waiting to be fed. ""That's a nice dog""Jack said, pointing at the animal. ""Yes, he's handsome. He's a bit of a mixture but that's not a bad thing. He's strong and healthy"" ""And hungry,"" Jack said. ""He hasn't taken his eyes off you. He thinks you've got some food for him."" ""That's true,""Sue said, But I haven't."" The two friends laughed and then Jack said, ""Does your dog bite?"" ""No,"" Sue said. ""He's never bitten anyone. He's always gentle and good-tempered ."" Hearing this, Jack decided to _ the dog. He put out his hand and touched the animal's head. Immediately it jumped up and bit him. ""Hey!"" Jack shouted. ""You said he didn't bite."" ""No, I didn't,""Sue replied. ""You asked,if my dog bit, and I said no."	['hungry']
When you cross the street,you must look to _ first.	When you travel in Hong Kong,you must be careful of the traffic rules,because the traffic keeps to the left and it's different from that of the interior of China.Before crossing the street,you must look to the right and then to the left.If the traffic lights are red,the traffic must stop,people can go across the zebra line.If the traffic lights turn green,the traffic can go,and people mustn't cross the road. In the morning and in the evening,when people go to or come from work,the streets are very busy.The traffic is the most dangerous. When you go somewhere by bus in Hong Kong,you have to be careful,too.Always remember the traffic keeps to the left.Have a look first,or you may go the wrong way.In Hong Kong,there are a lot of big buses with two floors.You'd better sit on the second floor.From there you can watch the city very well.How interesting!

From what Rick says, we know _ .	"Construction workers in Southern California have made a wild discovery. They were digging at a building site in San Timoteo Canyon when they unearthed hundreds of ancient animal fossils. Researchers say the bones hold important clues about the history of the region. Nearly 1, 500 fossils were recovered from the dusty canyon. The remains are about 1.4 million years old. They include the bones of a new species of deer, several small rodents and more. A giant cat fossil was also found. Scientists believe the animal was an ancestor of the saber- toothed tiger. Signs of plant life were uncovered as well. ""This is a huge find,"" says Rick Greenwood, a scientist studying the site. ""I don't think most people had any idea that those types of animals were wandering around here more than a million years ago."" San Timoteo Canyon is located about 85 miles from Los Angeles. The area of the canyon where the fossils were found was once part of a green river valley. Today, the region is dry and plant life is rare. Most of the fossils are well preserved. Experts say a muddy lake bed may have trapped thirty animals that wandered over for a drink. The mud helped to protect the animal fossils. The remains are a million years older than those discovered at the famous La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. Scientists studying the bones will be able to learn more about how the animals adapted to changes in the environment. ""We have a confused view of what this time period was like, "" says another scientist. ""A discovery like this could really be an important contribution."" About 35 different animal species are represented in the fossil collection. Scientists began removing bones from the site last fall. The project was completed this summer. Starting next year, the fossils will be on display at the Western Science Center in the nearby city of Hemet, California."	['more research work will be carried on in the canyon.']

In the twentieth century class differences have been partly smoothed out by _ .	"In the eighteenth century one of the first modern economists, Adam Smith, thought that "" the whole annual produce of the land and labour of every country"" provided revenue to ""three different orders of people: those who live by rent, those who live by wages, and those who live by profit"". Each successive stage of the industrial revolution, however, made the social structure more complicated. Many intermediate groups grew up during the nineteenth century between the upper middle class and the working class. There were small-scale industrialists as well as large ones, small shopkeepers and tradesmen, officials and salaried employees, skilled and unskilled workers, and professional men such as doctors and teachers. Farmers and peasants continued in all countries as independent groups. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the possession of wealth inevitably affected a person's social position. Intelligent industrialists with initiative made fortunes by their wits which lifted them into an economic group far higher than that of their working-class parents. But they lacked social training of the upper class, who despised them as the ""new rich."" They often sent their sons and daughters to special schools to acquire social training. Here their children, mixed with the children of the upper classes, were accepted by them, and very often found marriage partners from among them. In the same way, a thrifty, hardworking labourer, though not clever himself, might save for his son enough to pay for an extended secondary school education in the hope that he would move in a ""white-collar"" occupation, carrying with it a higher salary and a move up in the social scale. In the twentieth century the increased taxation of higher incomes, the growth of the social services, and the wider development of educational opportunity have considerably altered the social outlook. The upper classes no longer are the sole, or even the main possessors of wealth, power and education, though inherited social position still carries considerable prestige."

What would be the best title for the passage?	Is it wrong to use someone else's wireless(Wi-Fi) connection?Just recently,a man was arrested for doing just that.At that time,he was sitting in the street with a laptop and using an unsecured wireless connection to surf the Net.What do you think about this topic?Listen to the following different views on it. For a start,if someone is using your Internet service or downloading,this will affect your speed of access or download limit.Also,it's bad for Internet service providers.They will suffer in the long run because fewer people will pay for an Internet service if they know they can get it for free.And finally,just imagine this:what if the person who is stealing your Internet connection is involved in an illegal activity?I think the police are totally right to arrest these criminals. --by Sandra Wilkins Basically,if the person who paid for the service still has everything they paid for,what's the problem?It's just like using the light from streetlamps to read your book,or watching someone else's firework display.It's not stealing. Also,if you leave your wireless connection unsecured,then it is your own fault if someone else uses it.Just as you wouldn't leave your front door unlocked,or your car door open,neither should you leave your wireless connection open.By leaving your wireless connection open,you are inviting people to use it.Securing your wireless connection is as easy as clicking a few settings on your router .And finally,haven't the police got more important crimes to solve?They're always saying how they haven't got the manpower to solve real issues.But this is just ridiculous . --by James Hoarley	['Wireless worries']
The couple and their kids _ .	"When Cath Pirret and her husband Iain took their daughters Jessie, 10, and Holly, 7, to Britain earlier this year, it was a trip that was all about showing the girls where their parents grew up. But there were also some key sightseeing opportunities, such as Stonehenge, Hadrian's Wall and Tate Modern, before heading to Paris to see the Mona Lisa and Venus de Milo. So, what did the couple from Melbourne hope their girls would get from the trip? ""A greater understanding that travel is not a difficult thing to do,"" Cath says.""Some of the highlights are to meet new people and adapt to lots of different situations."" Cath believes that children, in order to truly benefit from travel, need to be old enough to understand and appreciate the experience. Sydney-based ABC Radio broadcaster and film critic C.J. Johnson travelled a lot with his parents as a child. His father was ""really into rivers"" and decided he was going to make it the ""family mission"" to see the ""seven great rivers of the world"". There's no doubt, thanks to a richer society and the greater ease and access to all forms of travel, that few -- if any -- generations of parents and children have ever had the ability to journey together as far, as wide and as deep as the present one.Travel brings history to life, builds children's independence and opens their minds. A child's view also helps adults to see the world through new eyes. For Keith Bellows, the award-winning editor-in-chief of the American National Geographic Traveler magazine says the world is simply""the greatest classroom we have"". He's convinced, like Spicer, that any parent willing and financially able to give the gift of travel offers a gift that keeps on giving. ""Children who learn to travel will travel to learn,"" he says. ""And they will do it all their lives."" With that in mind, Bellows, a father of three, wrote a book, 100 Places that Can Change Your Child's Life."	['first stayed in Britain and then went to France']
The attitude of people in Hamilton towards such a behavior is_.	He has breakfast at 2 a.m.because Johnny Barnes, Mr.Happy Man, has work to do.From 4 to 10 a.m.,he greets commuters as they drive by on their way to work. For years he worked as an electrician on the Bermuda railway and drove buses.When he retired, he still wanted to feel useful.So he positions himself on a patch of grass next to a roundabout that leads into Hamilton, Bermuda's largest city.He smiles and waves at every single person who passes by.He tells them he loves them - and means it. In the Matt Morris's short documentary, he says: I'm just little Johnny Barnes.I'm just a little , small instrument in the hand of God be used any way he feels fit.What I do every day , 2:00 in the morning I'm getting my break fast.You're still sleeping [he tells the interviewer] , I guess. From 20 to four until ten I stand on the corner and just greet people, let them know that life is sweet and beautiful. No matter what happens in life, it's always sweet to be alive. No matter what the weather is like , he is there from Monday to Friday , spreading love. On the rare occasion he is not there , people call the radio station to see if he is OK.. He was 88 when the film was posted in 2012.Every day he was spreading love, straight from his generous heart. So well known and beloved is Barnes that the city of Hamilton built up a statue in his honour.The figure wears the same full beard and straw hat that are Barnes's trademarks.So even when the day comes for the real Johnny Barnes to pass from this life, his smile and his memory will still be at that corner, spreading love to every passer--by.

What is the message conveyed in the story?	"I was in a rush as always, but this time it was for an important date I just couldn't be late for! I found myself at a checkout counter behind an elderly woman seemingly in no hurry as she paid for her groceries. A PhD student with not a lot of money, I had hurried into the store to pick up some flowers. I was in a huge rush, thinking of my upcoming evening. I did not want to be late for this date. We were in Boston, a place not always known for small conversation between strangers. The woman stopped unloading her basket and looked up at me. She smiled. It was a nice smile -warm and reassuring -and I returned _ by smiling back. ""Must be a special lady, whoever it is that will be getting those beautiful flowers,"" she said. ""Yes, she's special,"" I said, and then to my embarrassment, the words kept coming out. ""It's only our second date, but somehow I am just having the feeling she's 'the one'."" Jokingly, I added, ""The only problem is that I can't figure out why she'd want to date a guy like me."" ""Well, I think she's very lucky to have a boyfriend who brings her such lovely flowers and who is obviously in love with her,"" the woman said."" ""My husband used to bring me flowers every week -even when times were tough and we didn't have much money. Those were incredible days; he was very romantic and - of course - I miss him since he's passed away."" I paid for my flowers as she was gathering up her groceries. There was no doubt in my mind as I walked up to her. I touched her on the shoulder and said, ""You were right, you know. These flowers are indeed for a very special lady."" I handed her the flowers and thanked her for such a nice conversation. It took her a moment to realize that I was giving her the flowers I had just purchased. ""You have a wonderful evening,"" I said. I left her with a big smile and my heart warmed as I saw her smelling the beautiful flowers. I remember being slightly late for my date that night and telling my girlfriend the above story. A couple of years later, when I finally worked up the courage to ask her to marry me, she told me that this story had helped to seal it for her -that was the night that I won her heart."

The text is probably taken from _ .	"A public high school in the rural town of Boonsboro,Maryland,offers a special program recently. Top students in the ninth and tenth grades can attend single-sex classes for math,science,English and social studies. The aim is to help teenagers keep their mind on their work by keeping males and females apart. Rebecca Brown chooses the students for what Boonsboro High School calls the Academy. ""What we really want to do is take that top group of kids and take them to the very highest level they can achieve here,so that they're prepared for college,"" she said. They need high marks and test scores and strong teacher recommendations. They also need to be involved in activities. Michael Bair has been at Boonsboro High School for twenty years and directs the Academy. His ninth-grade English class for boys centers on books that he believes boys find interesting. ""The novels they're reading now,are very manly novels. They're novels that deal with the arrogance of man and the pride of man."" One of those books,for example,is ""The Call of the Wild"" by Jack London. This classic story tells of a dog stolen from his home and sold to work as a sled dog in Canada's Klondike Gold Rush. On this day,the students are working in small groups. Vincent and Logan explain why they're drawing pictures that relate to the story. Vincent said,""The main character,Buck,gets abducted , and they send him off to the Yukon in a train. So I'm drawing part of the story where he's in the train. It gets you to _ the setting of the story and gets you to think more about what's going on in the story,the important events of the story."""" Instead of just doing work sheets about it,this is a lot more fun,"" Logan added happily. Morgan Van Fleet likes being in the Academy. She says boys and girls act differently when they are together in a classroom. ""To me,it almost seems like it's hindering your chances at developing yourself because you're more focused on 'Oh,I wish they'd shut up. Oh,what do they think of me?' instead of focusing on what's the homework or what's going on in this class,what's the lesson."""	['a news report']
What' s the principle China honors in the common development with other countries?	"BEIJING--Just as the Chinese people joyfully await the traditional Spring Festival, President Hu Jintao returned here Saturday after successfully concluding a four-day state visit to the United States,which opens a new chapter in cooperative partnership between China and the United States. During his visit,President Hu spared no efforts to make friends,to proclaim China' s philosophy of peaceful development and to express the Chinese people' s willingness to join hands with the world to greet a spring of harmonious development. In Washington,President Hu and his US counterpart,Barack Obama,agreed to build a China-US cooperative partnership based on mutual respect and mutual benefit,and marke d out priorities of the development of China-US relations for the future. Hu met with people from all walks of life in the United States,expounding to them the various policies of the Chinese government and China' s stand on developing China-US ties in the new era. The strengthening of bilateral cooperation and the shaping of a new type of relationship between two great nations will give some enlightenment to the world when tackling regional and international issues,will strengthen the belief of the international communities jointly facing common challenges and will forge a new way for all countries to co-exist harmoniously in a globalized world. During his visit,President Hu stressed that a China-US cooperative partnership should be based on mutual respect and mutual benefit. ""Mutual respect and mutual benefit""is not only the keyword in defining China-US relations,but also the principle China honors in the common development with other partners. As a goodwill messenger of a population of 1.3 billion, President Hu' s successful visit will more clearly define the relations between China' s development and the co-prosperity of the world,opening a new chapter in the history of international relations."

According to the passage, Robert Frost was famous for _ .	Robert Frost was at heart a mean-spirited human being, not the kind of man one would expect to write poetry. He was born in San Francisco. Frost entered Dartmouth University in 1893, but dropped out, and switched to Harvard, which he attended for two years. He started a brief teaching career, where he was inspired to become a poet by some of his students' work. Frost stopped teaching and became a farmer. During this time he wrote numerous poems, and a couple of short stories. While he was a farmer he started to think seriously about becoming a famous poet. In almost all of his poems, Frost wrote in the first person. The first widely-read poem that he published was called My Butterfly. At first his audience was very small, but with his Collected Poems he became famous. Robert Frost received almost all the awards that there were for poetry. His poetry describes the forces of nature, and the violence and deep emotional needs of human beings, which reflect the experiences of his childhood. Robert Frost will always be known as one of the best poets in history. His way of putting emotion and violence into words is remarkable . His talent for poetry is natural-born and he had discovered this when he started to farm. Even though he treated his wife and children terribly, he still became one of the best-known poets of his and our day.	['showing strong feeling in his poems']
Why is the Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary important in biodiversity?	"New Zealand will create one of the largest marine protected areas in the world, spanning an area of 620,000 sq km. The Kermadec Ocean Sanctuary will be one of the world's most significant fully protected ecosystems, the prime minister of New Zealand, John Key, told the UN General Assembly in New York. The sanctuary is in the South Pacific Ocean, about 1,000 km north-east of New Zealand, and expands a marine reserve that surrounds some small islands. The area is considered important in terms of biodiversity, featuring nearly 35 species of whales and dolphins, 150 types of fish and three of the world's seven sea turtle species. It is also geologically significant, including the world's longest chain of underwater volcanoes and the second deepest ocean trench, into 10 km underwater -- deeper than Mount Everest's height. The scale of the sanctuary will dwarf any previous New Zealand's protected area, spanning twice the size of the country's mainland. It will cover 15% of New Zealand's economic zone. Commercial and recreational fishing will be completely banned, as will oil, gas and mineral prospecting , exploration and mining. Key's government aims to pass legislation establishing the sanctuary next year. ""The sanctuary is a world-class, unspoiled marine environment and New Zealand is proud to protect it for future generations,""Key said.""New Zealanders value our coasts and oceans, which are an important part of our culture, economy and environment and we are committed to managing them sustainably. Creating protected areas will support not only our own fisheries, but those of our Pacific neighbors, adding to New Zealand's efforts to help grow Pacific economies through the responsible management of their ocean resources."" Nick Smith, New Zealand's environment minister, said the sanctuary might impose a cost upon the mining industry but that it is important to protect the ocean before exploration takes place.""New Zealand needs to use its vast ocean resources for jobs and exports in industries like fishing, aquaculture, minerals and energy, but we also need to set aside special areas where nature comes first and marine life is fully protected,"" Smith said. New Zealand will monitor the area via its navy and satellite technology. The Kermadec region will join three other key areas in the Pacific protected by the US, the UK and Australia. Matt Rand, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts' Global Ocean Legacy campaign, welcomed Key's announcement.""New Zealand will create the gold standard of conservation areas in the sanctuary, preserving one of the few relatively unspoiled areas of ocean on Earth,"" he said. ""This commitment is an exciting step toward meeting global goals to safeguard at least 30% of the ocean through fully protected marine reserves."""	['It has many different kinds of sea animals.']
When Mo was eighteen, _ .	"Guan Moye, better known as Mo Yan, is a Chinese novelist and short story writer. He has been referred to by Donald Morrison of U.S. news magazine, TIME, as ""one of the most famous and widely pirated of all Chinese writers"". He is best known to Western readers for Red Sorghum Clan , which was later adapted for the film, Red Sorghum. In 2012, Mo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Mo Yan was born in Gaomi County, Shandong Province. He was 11 years old when the Cultural Revolution started, at which time he left school to work as a farmer. At the age of 18, he began to work at a factory. During this period, his access to literature was largely limited to novels. At the close of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Mo joined the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and began writing. During this period, the works of Chinese literature, as well as translations of foreign authors such as William Faulkner, made an impact on his works. In 1984, he received a literary award from the PLA Magazine, and at the same year he began attending the Military Art Academy, where he first used the pen name of Mo Yan. ""Mo Yan"" means ""don't speak"" in Chinese. He explained that the name came from a warning from his father and mother about not saying what he thought when he was outside. It also related to the subject matter of his writings. Mo's first novel was Falling Rain on a Spring Night, published in 1981. Several of his novels were translated into English by Howard Goldblatt, professor of East Asian languages and literature, at the University of Notre Dame. He published his first novella , A Transparent Radish, in 1984, and released Red Sorghum Clan in 1986, making him a nationally recognized novelist. Five years later, he obtained a Master's degree in literature from Beijing Normal University."	['he became a worker at a factory']

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	Everyone knows that eating too much junk food is not good to our health. Yet, what is it about junk food that is so completely irresistible ? For one thing, it's everywhere. From chips in fast food restaurants to candy in supermarkets, junk food always seems available. Thankfully, science is now providing new clues to help us reduce snacking. Make friends with dainty eaters. Studies have found that people tend to increase or reduce the amount of food they eat depending on what their companions are taking in. See happy movies... and always get the smaller bag of popcorn . According to some experts, people eat up to 29% more popcorn if they are watching a sad or serious movie, compared to when they are watching a comedy. Viewers consumed almost 200 calories more when snacking from a large bucket, as opposed to when given a medium-sized container. Eat breakfast. Nutritionists have gone back and forth about the question of how much to eat in the morning, but new studies suggest that consuming a good breakfast is a must. Surveys on long-term weight-loss show that two key factors in keeping weight down are eating breakfast and exercising. Divide your food and conquer overeating. Any kind of dividing your food into portions slows down your eating. Any kind of marker makes you aware of what you're eating and of portion size. Researchers advise reallocating snack foods into small plastic bags. It sounds simplistic, but it works.	['If people are watching a tragedy, they eat up to 29% more popcorn.']
The best title for this passage should be _ .	When we have small cuts in the skin , something strange may happen. The cuts are able to heal themselves in a couple of days. How does this happen? Read on, and you will find out the secret. Every living thing on the earth is made up of cells . Cells grow and make new cells. Most cells are very small and we can't see them with our eyes. Different cells have different uses. Our skin cells are special ones. The cells on the outside of our skin are old dead cells. New skin cells are right under the outside. These are the living skin cells. They work for our bodies. They help protect our bodies and heal cuts. Our bodies make skin cells all the time. As the old cells fall off, new cells grow in the same place. Each person makes about 18 kg of skin cells during his or her life. Outside skin cells fit together closely with no _ between them. When you cut yourself, you can harm your skin cells. A small cut will not be harmful. Your skin will quickly heal itself by making new skin cells. How do skin cells work? First, the cells near the cut get bigger and move into the gap. Next, these bigger cells meet in the middle. They form a new layer of skin cells. Finally, new cells will grow until the gap disappears. In this way, your skin can grow and get well itself. How amazing the small cells are! Next time you have a cut, don't worry about it. Maybe in a few days, you will be surprised to find it healed.	['How Skin Cells Heal Cuts']
The best title for the news report is _ .	"Some of the best-known names in the entertainment industry have taken part in an unprecedented _ to help victims of the terrorist attacks in the United States. The benefit , called ""America: a Tribute to Heroes,"" was sponsored by all four major U.S television networks, ABC,CBS, FOIX and NBC. It was broadcast by three-dozen television, cable and radio networks across the country and aired live to more than a hundred countries around the world. Hollywood stars joined music entertainers in asking listeners and viewers to pledge cash donations to charities helping the victims of the September 11thattacks. Actors, including Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, tom Cruise and Clint Eastwood, told stories of heroic acts by people who tried to save others from the burning World trade Center and the Pentagon. Former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali made a rare public appearance in show of support. The appeals alternated with performances by such popular entertainers a Bruce Springsteen, Mariah Carey, Steve Wonder, Paul Simon and the rock band U--2. They appeared on stages in New York, Los Angeles and London, decorated with hundreds of burning candles. Singer Billy Joel sang "" New York State of Mind"" with a New York City firefighter's hat on his piano. Sting dedicated his song "" Gragile"" to a friend who died in the World Trade Center. Stevie Wonder condemned hatred in the name of religion before singing his song "" Love's in Need of Love today"".

The passage is mainly about _ .	"""Life is speeding up. Everyone is getting unwell."" This may sound like something someone would say today. But in fact, an unknown person who lived in Rome in AD 53 wrote it. We all love new inventions. They are exciting, amazing and can even change our lives. But have all these developments really improved the quality of our lives? Picture this. You're rushing to finish your homework on the computer. Your mobile phone rings, a QQ message from your friend appears on the screen, the noise from the television is getting louder and louder. Suddenly the computer goes blank and you lose all your work. Now you have to stay up all night to get it done. How happy do you feel? Inventions have speeded up our lives so much that they often leave up feeling stressed and tired. Why do you think people who live far away from noisy cities, who have no telephones, no cars, not even any electricity often seem to be happier? Perhaps because they live simpler lives. One family in the UK went ""back in time"" to see what life was like without all the inventions we have today. The grandparents, with their daughter, and grandsons Benjamin, 10 and Thomas, 7, spent nine weeks in a 1940s house. They had no washing machine, microwave , computer or mobile phones. The grandmother, Lyn, said, ""The more things you have, the more difficult life becomes."" The boys said they fought less. Probably, they said, because there was less to fight over, such as their computer. Benjamin also noticed that his grandmother had changed from being a ""trendy , beer-drinking granny"", to one who cooked things."	['problems with technology']
We can infer from the passage that _ .	"Dr Wiseman started ""the laugh lab"" project in September 2001. It is the largest study of humour. Participants are invited to log on to the laugh lab website, give a few personal details, tell their favourite jokes and judge the jokes told by other people. The project will last for a year, and the organizers hope to finally discover the world's funniest joke. But there is also a serious purpose. The researches want to know what people from different nations and cultures find funny. And they want to find out the differences between the male and female sense of humour. The idea is that if we want to understand each other, we have to find out what makes us laugh. This is a subject that has long attracted psychologists and philosophers. Most of the time, people are not completely honest. We do things that society expects us to and say things that help us get what we want. But laughing cannot be controlled. When we laugh, we tell the truth about ourselves. By December 2001 over 10, 000 jokes had been submitted. This gave the scientists enough evidence to make early conclusions. It seems that men and women do have different senses of humour, for instance. ""Our findings show the major differences in the ways in which males and females use humour, "" said Dr. Wiseman. ""Males use humour to appear superior to others, while women are more skilled in languages and prefer word play. "" Researchers also found that there really is such a thing as a national sense of humour. The British enjoy what is usually called ""toilet humour"". But the French like their jokes short and sharp: ""You're a high priced lawyer. Will you answer two questions for $500?"" ""Yes. What's the second question?"" The Germans are famous for not having a sense of humour. But the survey found that German participants were more likely to find submitted jokes funny than any other nationality. Perhaps that proves the point. Is this joke funny? I don't know, but let's say yes, just to be safe. Dr Wiseman and his workmates also submitted jokes created by computer. But none of those who took part in the survey found any of them amusing. Perhaps this is relief. Computers already seem like they can do everything. At least they should leave the funny stuff to us."

When Dr. Gwaltney gives a reply in the end of the passage, he means that _ .	"Dr. Jack M. Gwaltney, Jr. a professor at the University Of Virginia School Of Medicine infected six student volunteers with virus, the most common cause of colds. A few days later, when they were coughing and sneezing, he gathered 37 more people and divided them into three groups. Group 1 members spent three days and nights in the same room with one of the infected students, separated by a screen so they couldn't touch one another. Group 2 sat around a table while an infected volunteer talked, coughed and sang to them. Group 3 held hands with an infected student for ten seconds, and then touched their own noses or eyes. Although most scientists at the time, the mid-70s, believed colds were spread by virus-laden droplets spread through the air when infected people coughed or sneezed, Gwaltney suspected physical contact might play an important role. Sure enough, of the 15 people who had touched a student volunteer, 11 became infected--compared with only one of those who had been sitting at the table, and none who had spent three days and nights together. ""The best evidence we have is that hand-to-hand contact is the most efficient way of transmitting virus,"" says Gwaltney. The study was one of a series that helped establish Gwaltney's reputation as a leading authority. Dr. Robert Couch says, ""It would not be inappropriate to call him Mr. Common Cold."" When Gwaltney is asked how close scientists are to finding a cure, he replies: ""If you mean 'get rid of', I don't think we're going to be able to do that with cold viruses any time soon. But if you look in the dictionary, you'll see that 'cure' is explained as a successful treatment. And we're not just getting more effective at treating the symptoms --we're getting at the root cause too. """	['they have made much progress in dealing with colds']
We can conclude from this passage that _ .	Did you know that a turtle can lay 12 eggs in one minute? A large sea turtle lays around 150 eggs at a time. She lays all these eggs in just a few minutes. Large sea turtles live in the warm seas of the world. Except for when they lay their eggs, they spend their whole lives in the water. When it is time to lay their eggs, the females swim to land. They usually return to the place where they themselves were born. How they find their way back there is unknown. When they reach shore, the big, heavy turtles crawl slowly up to the high water mark. Using their flippers, they pull themselves along the sand. They must struggle like mountain climbers. When they finally reach dry sand, they rest before beginning the difficult task of laying eggs. The turtles lay the eggs in deep holes and cover them with warm sand. The sand protects the eggs from harm. Then the females leave them. After a few weeks, if you happened to be walking along the beach, you might see the sand begin to shake. You may see tiny black balls coming out of the sand. The tiny heads of baby turtles!

Each time the rich man left his home, the servant would drink the wine and eat up all the nice food in the house. The rich man knew what his servant did, but he had never caught his servant doing that. One morning, when he left home, he said to the servant, ""Here are two bottles of poison and some nice food in the house. You must take good care of them."" With these words, he went out.

Greenhouse effect comes from _ .	April 22 is Earth Day. Everyone on Earth should care about and protect the earth! The earth has warmed by about 1degF over the past 100 years, but why and how? Well, scientists are not quite sure. Maybe the earth gets warmer and warmer on its own. But many scientists say that people are doing many things which makes the earth warmer. First, greenhouse effect is a very important reason for the change of the earth. People give out too much energy into the air every year. It makes the earth warmer. Climate change is another important reason. Sometimes it becomes too hot and sometimes too cold. Sometimes there is too much rain and sometimes too little. The change of the climate makes the earth warmer. In turn, the warmth of the earth changes the climate, too. When the earth becomes warmer, there may be more rain and a rise in sea level. It will affect the growth of plants, animals and people. On a Pacific island, 100 people have to move to higher ground because the sea is rising. These people can no longer live on the coast. Before that, two islands without people went underwater in 1999. Scientists say that the seas can rise by nearly one metre by 2100. People can affect the earth's air, land and water. As for us, we can do many things to protect the earth. For example, we can use fridges less. We can tell more people about protecting the earth.	"[""people's activity""]"
Who believes children's brothers and sisters may influence their academic performance?	"On countless mornings over the past year, I stood with my son, James, in our driveway, watching our neighbor hurry off to kindergarten.My wife and I wanted to give James the best education, but that meant we'd have to change our jobs and spend less time with our kid.I asked myself, ""Would this trade-off be worth it?"" When I look at the research on child development, I think it might not.Where our kids go to school might matter less than most American parents think. Social scientists have long tried to determine why some children grow up to be successful.In a 2001 study, Greg Duncan, a professor of education at the University of California, measured the influence that the people in a child's life have on how well the child does in school.Duncan and his team found almost no relationship between how students did on the test and whom they sat beside in class, whom they hung out with after school and who lived in their block.The only meaningful link they found was between siblings and twins in particular. For a long time, scholars thought that a family's income heavily affected how well kids did in life.But that might not be the case.When Susan Mayer at the University of Chicago looked at the relationship between family income and lifetime achievement, she ran a series of experiments to measure it, finding such outcomes weren't caused by income.She argued that the things that make a difference are relatively inexpensive: the number of books a kid has or how often his family goes to museums. Lareau, another scholar began one of the most in-depth observations of American parenting.He concluded that success is much more related to the amount of time parents spend with their children.He said ""Many parents I interviewed are anxious about their children's futures.But they have exaggerated the sense of the risks involved if they don't give their children 'the best' of everything."" So at last, we decided to leave things as it were.More time with our kid is the best we can provide."	['Greg Duncan.']

Those who want more economic growth believe that continued economic growth _ .	There is much discussion today about whether economic growth is desirable. At an earlier period, our desire for material wealth may have been justified. Now, however, this desire for more than we need is causing serious problems. Even though we have good intentions, we may be producing too much, too fast. Those who criticize economic growth argue that we must slow down. They believe that society is approaching certain limits on growth. These include the fixed supply of natural resources, the possible negative effects of industry on the natural environment, and the continuing increase in the world's population. As society reaches these limits, economic growth can no longer continue, and the quality of life will decrease. People who want more economic growth, on the other hand, argue that even at the present growth rate there are still many poor people in the world. These proponents of economic growth believe that only more growth can create the capital needed to improve the quality of life in the world. Furthermore, they argue that only continued growth can provide the financial resources required to protect our natural surroundings from industrialization. This debate over the desirability of continued economic growth is of vital importance to business and industry. If those who argue against economic growth are correct, the problems they mention cannot be ignored. To find a solution, economists and business community must pay attention to these problems and discuss them with one another.	['is essential to the well-being of society as a whole']
How is the text mainly developed?	"""I can't live without my mobile phone!"" is what I often hear people say as they talk about how mobiles have become an essential part of their lives. The all so common sight of heads bent, eyes staring at mobile screens and fingers busy tapping away repeats itself across major cities around the world. Whenever there is a moment to spare while on the train, taxi or waiting in a queue, people busy themselves with their mobile phones. Some people believe our unhealthy obsession with mobile phones is destroying how we appreciate the little things in life or miss the moments that matter. The truth is that technology overall should be seen as just a tool to improve our lives. Mobile phones have certainly had a great influence on our lives, but I truly believe it is for the better. It's changed the way we communicate, whether for work or play. We are now less constrained by time and geographical location. With my mobile phone, I can dial into conference calls while stuck in a traffic jam, or reply to urgent e-mails while on the go. I can send a text message or share photos and videos with friends who aren't living in the same country. My phone calendar keeps my life organized, and even Facebook, Twitter, and instant messaging are now accessible from mobile phones! The mobile revolution isn't just changing the lives of urbanities like myself. I know of a young Bangladeshi woman named Shompa Akhter who is crazy about fashion and design. She dreamt about starting her own business and she did just that, opening a shop in Kushtia featuring her own creations. Dealing with supplies in different towns was a problem for Shompa --- purchase orders had to either be hand delivered or mailed out to supplies. Shompa also found it tough publicizing her business to potential customers outside her town. But once she learnt to operate the mobile phone, she was addicted. The 25-year-old businesswoman now stays in touch easily with her suppliers. Mobile e-mail is a blessing in her life. Who would have thought that mobility could bring about such enormous change? It shouldn't really be a surprise though."	['By comparing different ideas.']
What would be the best title for the passage?	"We are so used to having a cup of tea before heading off to work, during work or after getting back from work. Tea breaks are more like a custom that takes place regularly several times a day. This tea break tradition has been happening during the past 200 years or so. Tea just happens to be a wonderful drink for most of us. The day simply feels incomplete without a hot cup of tea. However, is tea good for you? In 2006, the papers were flooded with the news of research showing that drinking 2-3 cups of tea a day is as beneficial as drinking water, with even some additional health benefits. Another report published in November 2009, stated that drinking up to eight cups of tea a day is good for you. The research conducted by nutrition expert Dr. Carrie Ruxton, debunked the popular stories about caffeinated drinks like tea, coffee and cocoa. According to Dr. Ruxton, the caffeine present in tea tends to lower the risk of heart attacks and strokes. She says that drinking 8 cups of tea a day gives the drinkers ""the best levels of health-giving substances"" present in tea and other caffeinated drinks. Contrary to popular belief that tea does not contain more caffeine than coffee, it actually contains almost half the amount. Caffeine is a natural thing found in many types of food and drink. It's also something that can give you a much needed lift for a demanding and tiring afternoon ahead. Research shows that proper amounts of caffeine are safe for most people. So why not take full advantage of your tea breaks at work, or make time for afternoon tea while out shopping at the weekend? And remember that tea is not just a great drink, but it helps to keep you looking and feeling healthy."	['Tea--a Healthy Drink']
What is the best title of the passage?	"""Have a nice day!"" may be a pleasant gesture or a meaningless. When my friend Maxie says ""Have a nice day"" with a smile, I know she sincerely cares about what happens to me. I feel loved and secure since another person cares about me and wishes me well. ""Have a nice day. Next!""This version of the expression is spoken by a salesgirl at the supermarket who is rushing me and my groceries out the door. The words come out in the same tone with a fixed procedure. They are spoken at me, not to me. Obviously, the concern for my day and everyone else's is the management's attempt to increase business. The expression is one of those behaviors that help people get along with each other. Sometimes it indicates the end of a meeting. As soon as you hear it, you know the meeting is at an end. Sometimes the expression saves us when we don't know what to say ""oh, you may have a tooth out? I'm terribly sorry, but have a nice day."" The expression can be pleasant. If a stranger says ""Have a nice day"" to you, you may find it heart-warming because someone you don't know has tried to be nice to you. Although the use of the expression is an insincere, meaningless social custom at times, there is nothing wrong with the sentence except that it is a little uninteresting. The salesgirl, the waitress, the teacher, and all the countless others who speak it without thinking may not really care about my day. But in a strange and comfortable way, it's nice to know they care enough to pretend they care when they really don't care all that much. While the expression may not often be sincere, it is always spoken. The point is that people say it all the time when they like."	['Have a Nice Day--a Social Custom.']
Which word can best describe the scientists' attitude towards the stem cell technology?	Surgeons in Spain have successfully carried out the world's first organ transplant using new stem cell technology. Some people are calling it the greatest medical breakthrough so far this century. But what are stem cells? As we know, most cells in our bodies are designed to serve specific purposes - for example, a liver cell develops to work in the liver and cannot become a heart cell. But stem cells are different. They are very young, and in the laboratory scientists can grow them into different types of cell. Claudia Castillo needed a new windpipe after getting a serious disease. Scientists from the University of Bristol in the UK took a donor windpipe, or trachea, from someone who had recently died. They used strong chemicals to remove the donor's cells, leaving a tissue scaffold . This was refilled with cells from Ms Castillo's windpipe, and stem cells from her bone. After four days the cells had grown sufficiently for the windpipe to be transplanted into Ms Castillo. Currently, transplant patients have to take drugs for the rest of their lives to prevent their bodies rejecting the new organs. These drugs can have bad side-effects, and do not always prevent rejection. But by using Ms Castillo's own cells, doctors were able to trick her body into thinking the new windpipe was her own organ. Five months on, Claudia Castillo is in perfect health. This ground-breaking procedure could be used in other transplant operations in the future. Scientists also believe stem cells might be used to treat Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, stroke, arthritis, diabetes, burns and so on. However, stem cell research is extremely controversial. The most effective stem cells do not come from adults but from embryos created in laboratories and which are just a few days old. Many people have religious or ethical objections to growing embryos, even if they can be used to cure diseases.	['confident']

The author waited until the light went green because _ .	"Last night I drove a long way (about 500 km) to return home. It was late and I was driving fast because I wanted to get home as soon as possible. So several times when I was driving behind a slow-moving truck on a narrow road, I wanted to shout at the driver ahead. Then I came to a crossroad with a traffic light. As I drove near, it turned red. I stopped my car at once. I looked left,right and behind. I found no cars or persons -- I was alone on the road. The person who would come to the crossroad was at least a mile away in any direction. Certainly going through the light would cause no danger. I could pass the traffic light. But strangely enough, I just stopped there, waiting for several minutes until the light went green. I asked myself why I refused to run the light. Surely it was unnecessary for me to be afraid of danger or being fined , because there were no cars or police around at all. But I remained waiting until the light changed. When I finally got home, it was near midnight. My wife had fallen asleep. The question of why I stopped for that light came back to me again, because I stopped another two times for the red lights as ""special"" as the first one. I stopped, not because of the law, but because it was a good habit I had developed. In fact, we were used to doing something right just because we have made obeying the rules a good habit. We do it just because we should do it. I thought if another man met with the same thing, he would make the same choice. I believed so. And I could be trusted by others. I believed that everyone would and could control himself/herself well. It was amazing that we trusted each other to do the right things, wasn't it?"	['he was used to obeying traffic rules']

Which of the following statements might the author agree with?	"A baby mermaid was just born in Finland; Justin Bibber is getting married; iphone 6 is going to be released this year...We read rumors every day on the Internet. With the help of social media, rumors -- no matter whether they are true or false -- spread like wildfire, and sometimes we can't be sure what to believe. Now, an international group of researchers might be able to make it easier for us. They are working on a lie detector that could separate online truth from lies, Discovery news reported. Named after the Greek goddess Pheme, famed for spreading bad rumors, the system is far from a traditional lie detector, which works by attaching a machine to a potential liar. Instead, Pheme analyzes the rumor directly. When a rumor comes out, on a micro blog, for example, Pheme can trace the source of information to see if it was released by reliable sources like experts or news agencies. If it wasn't, Pheme then examines the history and background of the account to identify whether it was created just to spread rumors -- whether it's what's called an ""Internet bot."" After finding the source of the rumor, the system can keep a close eye on how other users react to the rumor -- either confirming or denying it -- to help analyze and further determine the reliability of the information. Some people might find the Pheme system unnecessary based on the idea that false rumors never survive for long and people always get to the truth over time. While that's a fair point, there is a certain class of rumors, such as ""a tiger is at large"" or ""an asteroid is about to hit the Earth"", that can cause panic among people and thus lead to serious consequences. These are cases when we need to be able to check for accuracy quickly. ""Our system aims to help with that, by tracking and verifying information in real time,"" lead researcher Kalina Bontcheva, at the University of Sheffield, UK, told the BBC. According to Bontcheva, Pheme is still under development and won't be ready for another 18 months.[:. . ] Until then, there's an old fashioned technique that you can use to protect yourself from false information -- ask questions, check sources and don't believe any claim until you've seen the evidence for it."

What is the main idea of the passage?	Our children feel stressed out by an educational system that actually uses stress as an educational technique. It's a constant pressure of homework deadlines,essays and exams. And our children are told at a young age that failing a test means that they are failures in life. They'll end up nowhere if they don't pass this or that exam. Our educational system is based on a very Western idea that life is a struggle and you'd better measure up. It's survival of the fittest. While there is some truth to this,not as much as people think. Our ancestors didn't develop a constant stress environment. Back then,stress came quickly and was over quickly,it wasn't like the stress of modern education. Stress was originally just a shortterm biological response to danger;however,the constant stress of modern education rarely stops. It's long term,at least ten years and usually more. Recent research has shown that the neurological response to stress is the same response that is found in depression. So,what's the solution? A number have been proposed,including but not limited to the following. _ .Exercise consumes energy that would otherwise build up in the stress response and could cause physical and mental problems. Teach relaxation exercises. Allowing the mind and body to relax cuts off the stress response and reduces the neurological fatigue ,enabling the individual to recover at least somewhat. Pay attention to thinking. Training the stressed student to pay attention to his or her own mind to a point where he or she is sufficiently aware to shut off the stress response when necessary. Of course,there's a logical answer to the problem. Just rearrange our teaching methods to encourage,rather than prevent,the natural curiosity and joy in learning that we are all born with. This would remove the stress and probably cut learning time in half.	['Dealing with stress in modern education.']
The first working 3D printer was created in _ .	"You've heard of 3D printing from newspaper and TV programs. It can ""print"" in plastic, metal, nylon, and over a hundred other materials. 3D printing technology has been around since the 1980s, it was not widely used until the early 2010s. The first working 3D printer was created in 1984 by Chuck Hull. 3D printers use many different types of technologies, but they all share one thing in common: they create a three-dimensional object by building it layer , by continuing layer, until the whole object is completed. Imagine a baker lay down each layer one at a time until the whole cake is formed. 3D printing is somewhat similar, but just a bit stricter. How can 3D printers work so well? The most important thing-a program, a 3D printer also needs to have instructions for what to print from a computer. It needs a file as well. The file which is a Computer Aided Design (CAD) paper is created with the use of a 3D modeling program. The program creates a paper that is sent to the 3D printer. Along the way, software pieces the design into hundreds, or more likely thousands of layers. The 3D printer builds up one layer at a time, from the bottom to the top, until the object is done. 3D printings can be used for making many kinds of things such as machine parts, daily life objects, even human organs using a person's own cells. Nowadays, Marc. Dillon founds a project which deals with many world famous paintings like Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, Van Gogh's Sunflower with 3D technology. This project helps the blind people enjoy the fantastic art through touching. In order to provide a good user experience, these 3D paintings have special instruments which can tell people what they touch."	['1984']

While using a card wisely can be an important part of building credit and making it through a difficult time, knowing how to use a card wisely can be the hard part. Stick to the following rules when, and if, you need to use a credit card: You can repay the charge(s) within the card's next billing cycle. You must meet your basic needs, like food, clothing and shelter, but set rules and be aware that you will need to repay those charges at the end of the month. You can talk to the financial aid office in your school for an alternative in ""emergency"" situations. If you do want a credit card, just be smart about it. (They let you in to that school because of your brain, right?) Don't automatically get the first one you find. Shop around for a card that has the lowest interest rate possible, and consider places that may not be advertising on campus. Additionally, be aware of any card's repayment options: When will payments be due? How much will they be? A credit card is not like a loan that comes with a grace period after you graduate and waits until you are done with school. That new sweater and nice dinner out will need to be paid back right away."	['Student Credit Cards -- What You Need to Know']

Which of the following statements is supported by the passage?	Reading is not the only way to gain knowledge of the work in the past. There is another large reservoir which may be called experience, and the college students will find that every craftsman has something he can teach and will generally teach gladly to any college student who does not look down upon them. The information from them differs from that in textbooks and papers chiefly in that its theoretical part -- the explanations of why things happen -- is frequently quite fantastic . But the demonstration and report of what happens, and how it happens are correct even if the reports are in completely unscientific terms. Presently the college students will learn, in this case also, what to accept and what to reject. One important thing for a college student to remember is that if Aristotle could talk to the fisherman, so can he. Another source of knowledge is the vast store of traditional practices handed down from father to son , or mother to daughter, of old country customs ,of folklore . All this is very difficult for a college student to examine, for much knowledge and personal experience is needed here to separate good plants from wild grass.The college students should learn to realize and remember how much of real value science has found in _ and how often scientific discoveries of what had existed in this area long age.

The Indian chief's purpose of writing the letter seems to be to _ .	On June 17, 1774, the officials from Maryland and Virginia held a talk with the Indians of the Six Nations. The Indians were invited to send boys to William and Mary College. In a letter the next day they refused the offer as follows: We know that you have a high opinion of the kind of learning taught in your colleges, and that the costs of living of our young men, while with you, would be very expensive to you. We are sure that you mean to do us good by your proposal ; and we thank you heartily. But you must know that different nations have different ways of looking at things, and you will therefore not be offended if our ideas of this kind of education happen not to be the same as yours. We have had some experience of it. Several of our young people were formerly brought up at the colleges of the northern provinces: they were taught all your sciences; but when they came back to us, they were bad manners, ignorant of every means of living in the woods-they were totally good for nothing. We are, however, not the less thankful by your kind offer, though we refuse to accept it; and, to show our grateful sense of it, if the gentlemen of Virginia will send us a dozen of their sons, we will take care of their education, teach them in all we know, and make men of them.

AS for the working environment,Tains prefers _ .	Dear Alfred, I want to tell you how important your help is to my life. Growing up, I had people telling me I was too slow, though, with an IQ of 150 at 17, I'm anything but stupid. The fact was that I was found to have ADIID . Anxious all the time, I was unable to keep focused for more than an hour at a time. However, when something did interest me, I could become absorbed. In high school, I became curious about the computer, and built my first website. Moreover, I completed the senior course of Computer Basics, plus five relevant pre-college courses. While I was exploring my curiosity, my disease got worse. I wanted to go to college after high school, but couldn't . So, I was killing my time at home until June 2012 when I discovered the online computer courses of your training center. Since then, I have taken courses like Data Science and Advanced Mathematics. Currently, I'm learning your Probability course. I have hundreds of printer paper, covered in self-written notes from your video. This has given me a purpose. Last year, I spent all my time looking for a job where, without dealing with the public , I could work alone, but still have a team to talk to. Luckily, I discovered the job--Data Analyst--this month and have been going full steam ahead. I want to prove that I can teach myself a respectful profession, without going to college, and be just as good as, if not better than, my competitors. Thank you. You've given me hope that I can follow my heart. For the first time, I feel good about myself because I'm doing something, not because someone told me I was doing good. I feel whole. This is why you're saving my life. Yours, Tanis	['working by herself']
According to the passage, the hottest place is _ .	Come to Austria! Soll is a village in the mountains in western Austria. The Post Hotel, opened by a local family, is clean and not expensive. From the hotel you can see the whole village, the forest and the mountains. Temperatures in summer are usually 20degCto 25degCin the daytime, but much cooler at night. Enjoy Thailand! When you visit Bangkok in Thailand, do not miss the early morning river boat trip to the Floating Market just outside the city. There you will find many kinds of fruits and vegetables. There you can pay for them when you sit in your boat. Don't forget your hat and sunglasses: the sun can be strong and it may be as hot as 40degCat noon! Visit Hawaii! Maybe the most beautiful place in Hawaii is Kauai. You can visit its long, sandy beaches in the south and west of the island, and mountains and forests in the north, but be careful: there are many mosquitoes , and don't be surprised if it rains in the center of the land. Daytime temperatures there are usually around 24degCto 26degCby the sea, and only a little cooler in late evening.	['Bangkok']
From the text we can infer that Mother Teresa_.	Mother Teresa, whose name was Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, was born on August 26th, 1910 in Skopje, Macedonia. She always wrote her birthday as 27th of August because it was the day of her baptism , which was always more important to her than her birthday. For her work with the poor around the world, she received the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. In 1928, she accepted a religious order and took the name Teresa. The order immediately sent her to India. A few years later, she began teaching in Calcutta. In 1948 the Catholic Church agreed her request and let her enter the convent and she began to work for the poor people. She became an Indian citizen in the following year. In 1950, she set up a religious organization in Calcutta. The organization provided food for the poor people and then she set up hospitals, schools, youth centers, and homes for the sick and the dying poor. It now has branches in 50 Indian cities and 30 other countries. Besides the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, Mother Teresa has received other awards for her work with the poor people. On September 5th, 1997, Mother Teresa passed away, but she will continue to inspire people all over the world through her lasting present of love and faith. Mother Teresa often reminded the world that she was a nun , not a social worker, and that prayer and communication with God were at the deepest heart of her every action.

Why did the older angel repair the hole for the rich family?	"Two traveling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was rude and refused to let the angels stay in the guest room. Instead the angels were given a space in the cold basement. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied, ""Things aren't always what they seem. "" The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very hospitable farmer and his wife. After sharing what little food they had, the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field. The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, ""How could this happen? Why did you not watch out for the cow? The first man had everything, yet you watched over his house,"" she accused. ""The second family had little but was willing to share everything, and you did not help. "" ""Things aren't always what they seem,"" the older angel replied. ""When we stayed in the basement, I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he couldn't find it. Then last night as we slept in the farmer's bed, the angel of death came for his wife. I ask God if the angel could take the cow instead. Things aren't always what they seem. """	"[""Because she didn't like the greedy owner.""]"
What can we do with the flu viruses?	The H1Nl virus has been spreading world-wide,it is important for us to know how to control it.Please pay attention to the following points: 1.Don't touch your face.Above all,keep your hands away from your eyes,mouth and nose,all of which serve pathways for the viruses to enter your body. 2.Wash your hands.If you have to touch your face,wash your hands,getting under the fingernails for 20 to 30 seconds with hot soap and water before.Soaps with surfactants can deal with flu viruses. 3.Cover your nose and mouth.When someone sneezes or coughs,liquid drops with flu viruses as far as three feet through the air and land on your nose and mouth,so it's best to keep at least an arm's length distance when talking to someone who shows signs of infection .In order to protect others,cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze,and clean your hands afterward.Viruses can live for hours,or even longer when on the skin or other surfaces such as keyboards. 4.Consider buying a mask in case you need it in the future.Some research suggests that masks reduce the risk of getting the flu viruses by as much as 80%.But it also suggests that if you don't wash hands,the mask doesn't work well.So wash your hands and use the mask,especially wearing face masks in crowded places is also useful. ,.

While watering the plants, what should we remember to do?	As with any house guests, indoor plants require a certain amount of basic, regular attention if they are going to feel at home. The first consideration when purchasing plants is to make reasonably sure that they are suitable for the condition in which they are going to be housed. A general rule for most plants being brought indoors for the first time is to ensure that they have reasonable temperature of not less than 60 degrees Fahrenheit, a position out of cold air, safe from pets and not exposed to strong sunlight. Plants love company. When plants are growing together, they create an atmosphere of damp around themselves which is far more beneficial than hot dry conditions. A group of plants will also present a more pleasing picture and provide an opportunity for a creative arrangement. There is no secret to this. Just rely on your natural feeling for harmony. Watering and feeding plants are probably the two areas of care that are the least well understood, but, again, if you follow a few simple rules, your plants should do well. Cold slightly warm water is therefore the answer. It is usually better to pour water on to the soil on the surface of the pot rather than put the water into the pot holder at the bottom. Avoid giving small amount of water at regular intervals- it is much better to wet the soil right through the pot in one go and then to allow it to dry noticeably before giving it a further watering. The majority of indoor plants will be in active growth from March until October, and during this time, the established ones will benefit from regular feeding. This may mean feeding with a weak liquid fertilizer at each watering or at intervals of a week or ten days with fertilizer at a standard strength. It is important, however, to ensure that plants are not fed when growth is inactive, when the soil in the pot is dry, or too soon after the plants has been potted up.	['Use water that is a little warm.']
Which of the following about the class in America is TRUE?	The class in America is almost the same as that in China. But something is different. 1.In America, if the teacher asks you a question but you don't understand, you should put up your hand and ask the teacher to repeat it. If you don't know the answer, it is all right to tell the teacher that you don't know. Then he or she knows what you need to do. 2.You mustn't be absent on a test day. If you are seriously ill, call and let the teacher know you will not be there for the test. If your teacher allows you a make-up test , you should take the test in one or two days after you go back to school. 3.Be on time! It is impossible to be late. If you come in late, be sure to do it quietly. Take your books out of your bag after you enter the room. Then go to your seat and sit down quietly. In the US, you needn't knock before you come into the classroom. 4.If you have to leave during the class, do it quietly, too. There's no need to ask for the teacher's agreement.	"[""One can leave the classroom without the teacher's agreement.""]"
It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	When people talk of a virus these days, chances are that they are talking about computer virus that have the power wipe out all the valuable work people may have stored in their computers. Imagine, the virus has the power to make military systems, giant banks, airports, hospitals and traffic system come to stop! What does a computer virus do? It targets electronic objects that are programmed. The virus spreads through connections between these electronic objects. For virus spreading experts, e-mail is a favorite method of sending their destructive weapon. But scientists warn that this is not the worst that can happen. There is more. People are also connected through phones. The next virus may actually target mobile phones, especially those that are programmed to do many tasks apart from just communicating. It would then be easy for a virus to infect those programs and create major disorder. For example, these virus may have the power to record your phone conversations and make others hear them. They create problems with your electronic money accounts, or they could create a mountain of telephone bills for calls you never made. And that would be a disaster. A report on this was published in the New Scientist recently. One way out would be to have simpler phones with not so many different functions. This would mean there would mean there would be fewer programs for the virus to attack. But mobile phone producers are _ . People on longer want an electronic item to perform just one task. They want more and more functions added. That would mean more software programs to make the mobile phone perform all those functions. And that means the possibility of more viruses.

Mike may give up Notre Dame because of _ .	"Mike Maietta was eating lunch when he got a text message from his mom. ""Notre Dame,"" it said. "" _ !"" Mike, a senior at a Californian high school, shouted with joy. The big envelope meant that the excellent university in Indiana had offered him a place in its Class of 2013. But the $51,300 annual fee is a big trouble. So Mike and his parents are considering offers from several other colleges and are figuring out the costs of tuition, housing and holiday trips home. This year, money is the driving factor for a growing number of high school seniors, who have to decide what colleges to attend this fall. Less jobs and house prices have changed family spending. ""We're excited that Mike got into eight great schools,"" said Mike's father, an engineer at Microsoft. ""But if you consider going to school out of state, you've got to think about all of the other costs: moving, flying back and forth for the holidays. You're looking at about $3,000 a year, just for travel."" As families weigh their choices, some are going back to financial aid offices hoping help packages can be increased. Rachel Brown was happy to get a thick envelope from New York University (NYU). Although she has always wanted to live in Manhattan, she is seriously considering the University of California San Diego (UCSD), because of the high cost in New York. ""The tuition for NYU is twice as much as UCSD,"" said Rachel, 17. ""My mom doesn't want me to have a big debt when I graduate, and I don't want that either. I'd have to take out a loan of $15,000. I'll check and see if there's any way that NYU can offer me any financial aid."" More than 7.6 million American students have filled out the Free Application for Students Aid, 19.9 percent increase over last year. This month the Federal Department of Education urged college financial aid officers to give more help to certain families. A record 30,428 students applied for 2,300 places at Stanford, partly because the university increased financial aid for families earning below $10,000."	['financial concerns']
What can we learn from the passage?	"GU Zhaodi, 60, had taken water for granted for years. In fact, no one in the beautiful lake city of Wuxi, Jiangsu Province had bothered to spare a thought on water. But all that changed dramatically overnight last month when taps in the city ran dry. Due to a blue-green algae outbreak in Taihu Lake, China's third largest freshwater lake and the source of drinking water for 4 million Wuxi residents ,water from the city's taps became dark and smelly. ""I can't believe there is no water for drinking, let alone cooking and washing,""said Gu. The lake was blanketed with the algae, giving off a strong smell of rotting meat. A stone thrown into it took a long time to sink. Experts said that algae usually boom because of hot water and rich chemicals like phosphor in the water. ""High temperature and a lack of rain in the past few months helped the growth of algae,""said Zhang Lijun, an official from the State Environment Protection Administration. ""However, pollution from human activity should be most blamed for the disaster."" Taihu Lake is surrounded by many small factories, which _ in the 1980s.Inthe 1990s,many foreign-funded companies joined in. The industries prospered ,Wuxi has grown into one of the wealthiest cities in East China. But that came at the price of pollution. The lake was treated like a waste dump ,with factories emptying industrial waste and untreated sewage into it. Although, after the government's effort, life in the city has gone back to normal, the one-week crisis rang a bell for the government and local people.""It's time to rebuild the beauty of nature, or our lives will be at risk,""said Gu.

On my fourteenth birthday, my uncle bought me a dog. It was a big dog. Reporter: How long does it take you to train a dog, one month, half a year or one year? Mirabella: That depends on the dog. I have thirteen dogs and I let them all play together, but I do a lot of special work with each dog. They know I am their owner because I do all the feeding. Reporter: If you aren't a dog trainer, what will you be? Mirabella: A dog. Just joking. I will probably still work with animals.	"[""Her father's brother.""]"
Burke's series of books are intended for _ knowing little foreign language.	"In his earlier books, David Burke, a famous writer, translated the language of American teenagers for an older generation, and explained American idioms for English-language learners overseas. His latest effort targets American children who know little of foreign languages. He has written a series of books based on the observation that fairy tales are widely known across cultures. ""We start in English, and as the reader moves forward, the story starts to change into another language."" (INSTRUCTION CD: ""Once upon a time, there lived a poor girl--nvhaizi--named Cinderella who was very pretty--piaoliang. The nvhaizi, who was very piaoliang...."") Burke has published books of fairy tales with CDs in Mandarin Chinese, French, Italian, German, Hebrew, Japanese and Spanish. A separate Spanish-language version helps teach English to Lain American youngsters. Young readers learn about 20 words at each level, then move to the next level as they read a different fairy tale. ""For example, I've taken the story of Goldilocks , and I bring back all the words the kids have learned in Cinderella, and I add 20 more until the ninth level. By the end of the entire series, it will be 100 percent in the target language."" Burke says students often think of language learning as dull, but it doesn't have to be. He designed his books with color1ful cartoon-like illustrations that attract the young readers. He says many people in other parts of the world often speak at least two languages. Americans have a different reputation. ""It's a joke in the linguistic world that's painful, and funny. It's, What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual. And what do you call a person who speaks two languages? Bilingual. And what do you call a person who speaks one language? American."" Not all Americans are monolingual, of course, but too many Americans are fluent only in English, and he is working to change that."	['American children']
The purpose of the passage is to _ .	Experts say that agriculture provides fourteen percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions each year. The gases released include carbon dioxide, a major cause of global warming. Twenty-one nations around the world recently joined forces to better understand and prevent greenhouse gas emissions from farms. The Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases was launched at the United Nations conference on climate change. The meeting took place in Copenhagen,Denmark last month. Agricultural experts blame a number of farm activities for producing greenhouse gases. For example, animal waste and cattle digestive systems release methane(,) gas. Fertilized soil and the burning of crop waste also release harmful gases into the air. Experts say some methods of farming---turning the soil to prepare for planting---also release harmful carbon dioxide. An official of the European Commission's Directorate Genera1 for Research says agricultural greenhouse gas emissions can be cut. Maive Rute suggests feeding animals a diet designed to reduce emissions. The new agricultural research group says protecting against global warming is only part of its purpose. It says the world also needs to develop better farming methods to feed growing populations in poor countries. United States Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said no one single nation can fight agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and increase food production at the same time. This is why the _ e is important for combining resources and finding new ones. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) will increases spending on farm emissions research by ninety million dollars over the next four years. The total will reach one hundred thirty million dollars. The USDA will share the research with other countries in the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases and support researchers from developing countries that belong to the alliance. Money from the Borlaug Fellowship program will let the researchers study agricultural climate change with American scientists. Mister Vilsack said that just as climate change has no borders , there should be no borders for research.	['appeal   countries to cut agricultural emissions']
We need _ for a healthy diet.	"""An apple a day keeps the doctor away."" Similarly, if we drink a little more water ever day, we may find that we need to go to the doctor a lot less often. A healthy diet is made up of water and a great many different kinds of foods. We know that healthy foods like fruits, vegetables and fish, are important as they provide us with energy and fibre, without giving us too much fat and sugar. But why is water important? The human body needs water to survive. Water is important as it carries poisons and waste out of our bodies. However, doctors advise us to drink plenty of water, much more than the small amount we need to stay alive. Some doctors believe that water is important for our health in all kinds of ways. They believe that a great many illnesses and health problems stars as a result of dehydration--a lack of water in the body. Most people are dehydrated at least some of time, although they probably don't know it. It is surprising to learn that if we feel thirsty, we are already in the first stages of dehydration. In fact, we are advised to drink water before we feel thirsty. These doctors think that health problems such as headaches, high blood pressure and asthma could be helped if people drink more water. They also believe that drinking more water can help people who are overweight. Water contains no calories so it will not make us put on weight. If we drink water, we will probably drink less sugary soft drinks such as Coca-cola. Doctors also believe that drinking more water may stop people from overeating. They say that many people think that they are hungry when they are, in fact, thirsty. Doctors suggest, therefore, that we eat less food and drink more water. There are still many health problems that cannot be solved by drinking water, so we should not stop going to seeing the doctor completely. However, if we make a decision to drink water every day, we may find that we need to go to the doctor a lot less often."	['Water and different foods']
What's the best title of the passage?	"Chicago is considering firm measures to prevent the Asian carp,a giant fish native to the Far East,from coming into North America's Great Lakes in large numbers.Such a move could cost up to$18bn,a heavy economic burden to the city. This species,more than a metre in length,was originally introduced to southern US states three decades ago to control weeds in sewage treatment plants.But they escaped into the Mississippi River and increased in number quickly,making their way north towards the Great Lakes and threatening the native fish species along the way. ""Dozens of them will often leap out of the water as boats approach.''Michael Beecham,a local environmental expert,described how frightening the scene was.""I've gone down the river and seen these fish jump up and hit me in the face.It is a big problem for our native species,"" he said. A meeting has been organized to find a technological solution to the carp problem,one of which involves blocking parts of Chicago's canal system.Listening at the meeting was John Goss,who was worried about the effect that having barriers in the canal system would have on industry.""It would certainly increase the cost of transportation,""he told.""It is currently very cheap and efficient to bring materials and finished goods down the Chicago ship canal.'' Another cheaper option is to eat the fish out of existence.Dirk Fucik is selling carp burger at his fish shop not far from downtown Chicago.He thinks the carps are a great resource.""To catch it and throw it away is a waste,""he says.""Eating them helps solve the problem and also provides jobs.""But the idea has not yet caught on.So far,he is the only person in Chicago selling carp burgers."

Which of the following are good sleeping habits?	Sleep is like food for the brain. Enough sleep helps the body and brain grow and develop. According to the National Sleep Foundation in the US, adults need seven to nine hours of sleep every night. For students aged 10 to 17, a healthy amount is about eight to nine hours per night. But many students don't get enough sleep because of early school start times and heavy homework. About 80 percent of middle school students don't get enough sleep, the China Youth and Children Research Center reported. For some students, they want to sleep early, but they keep worrying about their schoolwork and can't fall asleep quickly. For others, they may even have _ which might keep them awake all night. These sleeping problems greatly affect people's lives. Experts have shown that lack of sleep for teenagers leads to poor grades. Students without enough sleep cannot pay attention in class or do well in sports. Also, the lack of sleep may make them depressed . Luckily, with good sleep habits, it is easier to fall asleep. Some of these good habits include avoiding drinks that make people excited late in the day, going to sleep at the same time each night, and sleeping in a comfortable place that is dark, quiet, and neither too warm nor too cold.

From the passage we know that the author _ .	"I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another l8 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out? It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unmarried college graduate student, and she decided to, put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: ""We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?"" They said: ""Of course. "" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers, She only gave in a few months later when my parents promised that would someday go to college. And 17 years later I did go to college. But I artlessly chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and ail of my working class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting. It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the $ 5 deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on."	['valued his dropping out']
Which of the following is NOT true?	"Barack Obama, a black man, is the president of the United States now. He was born on August 4th, 1961, in Hawaii and has lived in many places. His mother was from Kansas and his father was from Kenya. Obama went to Columbia University in New York and got a law degree at Harvard University in Massachusetts. His wife is Michelle Obama. She also worked as a lawyer and later worked for the University of Chicago. They have two young daughters. Obama wrote a bookDreams from My Father. ""I always live in the dream of my father and American people, "" Obama once said. He was born in a poor family. And he was taken good care of by his grandparents when he was young.

Which of the following may be supported by the writer?	"My parents are amazing. I had the most wonderful childhood, and it's not because I had everything I wanted or because I was a cool kid. I have learned a lot about parenting from what my parents did. Here are a few gems that I use now or plan to use in the future with my two boys. Here's how a conversation often went when I was a kid. Usually it was around 4:30 p.m. I said, ""I'm hungry. Can I have a cookie?"" My mom answered, ""No. Have a banana."" ""I don't want a banana."" ""Then you're not hungry."" Sometimes I was angry about it, but I knew that was good for me. Thanks mom for not letting me eat junk food . Now I agree with my mother and I have this same conversation with my three-year-old son. I hope it helps him form healthy diet habits. I know many of us heard this as children. ""If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you do it, too?"" If our kids asked for something just because everyone else had it or was doing it, we often got this response. It was the perfect response, and we soon learned not to ask for things because everyone else had it, but because it was something we wanted. I will always be thankful that my parents let us try the things that interested us, not the things they wanted to push us into. This helped me try swimming, dance, and the piano before second grade. I found a love -- singing -- and kept up with that through my college years. It drives me crazy, as a mom and teacher, when I see kids who are pushed into their parents' favorite activities, even when they don't have a passion for them."

What can be a suitable title for the text?	"My sister and I grew up in a little village in England. Our father was a struggling lawyer, but I always knew he was special. He never criticized us, but used praise to bring out our best. He'd say, ""If you pour water on flowers, they flourish . If you don't give them water, they die."" I remember as a child I said something unkind about somebody, and my father said, ""Any time you say something unpleasant about somebody else, it's a reflection of you."" He explained that if I looked for the best in people, I would get the best in return. From then on I've always tried to follow the principle in my life and later in running my company. Dad's also always very understanding. At 15, I started a magazine. It was taking up a great deal of my time, and the headmaster of my school gave me a choice: stay in school or leave to work on my magazine. I decided to leave, and Dad tried to _ the decision at first, as any good father would. When he realized I had made up my mind, he said, ""Richard, when I was 23, my dad persuaded me to go into law. And I've always regretted it. I wanted to be a biologist, but I didn't pursue my dream. You know what you want. Go fulfill it."" As it turned out, my little publication went on to become Student, a national magazine in the U.K.. My wife and I have two children, and I'd like to think we are bringing them up in the same way Dad raised me."	['My Respectable Father']
Which of the following may be the purpose of Dixson's science writing?	"The language used by scientists to explain complex ideas can be difficult and sometimes even boring. The language, with its Latin words and long scientific terms, could be one reason some people avoid learning about science, especially children. American Danielle Dixson is a marine biologist. She wants to make science fun for children. Dixson has turned that idea into a series of children's books. The nine books are written so that her research is easy to understand. ""I just don't really think kids should be left out of it and I thought that story books may be one of the easiest ways to sort of captivate them and have them understand."" Danielle Dixson is an assistant professor at the University of Delaware. Dixson says another goal of her science writing is to help increase understanding of the ocean environment. She spent almost two years in the South Pacific working on her post-doctoral research. She went to the island nation of Fiji to investigate coral reefs that are collapsing or, as she says, degrading. The goal of her research is to identify why some healthy coral reefs are breaking down. She also wants to find out how this degradation affects fish that live in and around the reefs. ""A number of the reefs are converting from being, you know, these beautiful coral reef systems that have a lot of holes for animals to hide in, into reefs that the coral's degrading and collapsing and then there is not as much hiding spaces for fishes and things like that."" Early in her research, Dixson made some videos for people in Fiji. The videos explained her work to the local community. She says she wanted them to understand how her research would help them. For the local children, Dixson started making books explaining her work. This helped to keep them from walking through her ""laboratory"" - baby pools filled with water she was using for her experiments. ""I was living, actually, in the village with some of the locals. It was a lot easier to get research done if they understood what I was doing and how it would help them. And one of the ways that I was able to connect with the adults was I would make these videos for them. And then I started making children's books for the kids so that they would have a better idea of why I was there, so that when I ask them not to walk through the baby pools I was using for experiments or something like that, that that would actually happen."" she added. When Dixson returned to the United States, she started doing the same thing for children in this country. She uses color1ful story books to capture the imagination of children. While she has their attention, she provides very useful information about science. As a marine scientist, Dixson wants her stories to be both educational and inspirational, serving as an agent for change. She also includes in her books ""a call to action,"" asking readers what they can do to make a difference. ""One of the things I do in those story books is I have a last page. And the last page talks about what you can do to help. You know, there is a lot of things that even a 6-year-old is able to do, whether it's shutting your lights off when you leave a room, or riding your bike to your friend's house instead of having your parents drive you. There is a lot of stuff that they can do and still feel they're making a difference."" Danielle Dixson's books shine a light on the environmental problems facing our world's oceans. They also make science fun and understandable for children. But her books may have an unintended consequence, something she may not have planned on."	['To make people aware of ocean environment']

The passage is mainly about _ .	"On October 31st, 2015, the official Xinhua news agency reported that China would allow two children for every couple. That meant that the country's one-child policy came to an end. To control the population growth, China started a policy of one child per couple in the 1970s. Why does China decide to relax the policy now? In fact, China began relaxing the policy in January, 2014, allowing couples to have a second baby if the mother or father was an only child. The change was thought as a major liberalization of the family planning of over thirty years. But new figures in January, 2015 suggested that fewer people than expected would like to have a second baby. Health officials said that there were about 11 million couples under the new policy. However, only 1 million couples applied to have a second child. Some couples said, ""Two kids? Thanks but no."" The influence of one-child policy seems hard to go in a short time. China's government has said that China will become the country with the most old people in the world in just 15 years, with more than 400 million people over the age of 60. And in the one-child families, when the only child grows up and gets married to another only child, they two have to take care of two old couples, the stress seems really heavy. To solve the problem of the _ population, one-child policy isn't suitable any more, and two-child policy is needed and necessary."	['Chinese two-child policy']
With Lego in the room, the author probably feels _ .	"When asked what they want for a gift, most teens would say a CD player, or maybe an iPod, but I want Lego. I received my first set for my fifth birthday, a tiny pizzeria with an umbrella and a delivery truck. Since then my collection has expanded rapidly and I have built skyscrapers, constructed spaceships and designed submarines. There is a small area in my house designated as The Lego Room. Beyond its door, I fantasize and govern my own small world of castles, modem cities, and thousands of Lego people. Each time I enter The Lego Room, a new story is created. Once, a friend asked to tour this room. Amazed by my Star Wars models, he reached for a ship and accidentally knocked over a restaurant, breaking it to pieces! This disaster became an opportunity to rebuild and I fashioned a two-story food court with a McDonald's, pizzeria, and drive-thru. It was better than the original! Ideas for new constructions fill my head and I write them down in a sketchbook. Lego represents a creative consistency in my life, much as an artist has his canvas and a musician, his violin. Lego has taught me to be an architect, engineer, governor, economist and so on. Lego has provided the building blocks of my future, developing my math skills and ability to follow complex directions. As I build new worlds, brick by brick, I imagine my own possibilities and opportunities. Through the ""lives"" of my Lego friends, I have been able to act out all kinds of experiences. They have served as a link between my childhood and manhood. My friends say I'm childlike and there is truth to that, but perhaps we should all find a way to keep in touch with our childhood. Lego is mine."	['proud']
The best title of the passage probably is _ .	"Internet use appears to cause a drop in psychological health, according to a research at Carnegie Mellon University. Even people who spent just a few hours a week on the Internet experienced more depression and loneliness than those who used Internet less frequently, the two-year study showed. And it wasn't that people who were already feeling bad spent more time on the Internet, but that using the Net actually appeared to cause the bad feeling. Researchers are puzzled by the results, which were completely the opposite to their experiences. They expected that the Net would prove socially healthier than television, since the Net allows users to choose the information and to communicate with others. The fact that Internet use reduces time available for family and friends may explain the drop-in well-being, researchers supposed. Faceless, bodiless ""virtual"" communication may be less psychologically satisfying than actual conversation, and the relationships formed through it may be shallower. Another possibility is that knowing the wider world via the Net makes users less satisfied with their lives. ""But it's important to remember this is not about the technology; it's about how it is used,"" says psychologist Christine Riley of Intel, one of the study founders. ""It really points to the need for considering social factors in terms of how you design applications and services for technology."""	['Internet May Cause Depression']
"Why is the word ""tuhao"" likely to be taken in Oxford English Dictionary?"	"China's new popular word, ""tuhao"", may be taken in next year's Oxford English dictionary. The word caught the attention of the dictionary's editing team after BBC's recent program on influential Chinese words. ""If its influence continues, it is very likely to appear on our updated list of words,"" said Julie Kleeman, project manager with the editing team. Kleeman told the Beijing Youth Daily that ""tuhao"" has some similarities with the English word ""bling"", which refers to expensive, ostentatious clothing or jewelry. Both the two words have existed for long but later on took a new meaning. In Chinese, ""tu"" means rude and ""hao"" means rich. It has traditionally been referred to rich people who throw their weight around in China's rural areas. In recent years, people in the ACG (anime, comic and game) circle borrowed the term to describe those who spend money in an unreasonable manner. The word gained acceptance in September with the launch of Apple's new gold-colored iPhone, an item loved by China's nouveau riche . The color became known as ""tuhao gold"".The word is now often used by the online community to refer to people who have the cash but lack the class to go with it. Kleeman also mentioned another Chinese word ""dama"" which may also be taken in the dictionary. ""Dama"", meaning middle-aged women, was first used in the Western media by the Wall Street Journal in May when thousands of Chinese women were buying up record number of gold. They were the driving force in the global gold market between April and June when the gold prices had dropped. ""People can have an intuitive grasp of the meanings if they see pinyin"", Kleeman said adding that people avoided using an English word to keep the original meaning. The new words will be first uploaded on the official website before the dictionaries arrive. The online version is also renewed every three months."

Parrotfish were mentioned to show lionfish's _ .	"In 1985, a lionfish was caught off the coast of Florida. Now they can be found not only in the Atlantic Ocean but also in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. And they are continuing to move south. Lionfish are native to the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. So how did they end up in the Atlantic? Scientists believe some pet owners abandoned their unwanted lionfish and poured them into the sea. Little did they know the trouble their actions would cause. The Atlantic Ocean turned out to be a comfortable home for lionfish. Their venomous spines protect them from sharks and other fish. Female lionfish can spawn every few days, producing as many as 2 million eggs per year. Other big fish would have competed with lionfish for food. Bet overfishing has removed many of these large fish. As a result, the fish have eaten so much that they have grown to be more then three times the size of their cousins in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. ""They eat mostly fish,"" says Stephanie Green, a scientist at Oregon State University. All that eating has caused great changes. Scientists have found that when lionfish are present somewhere, many other fish, which are small enough for them to eat, disappear. Some of the fish they eat are greatly missed in their habitats. For example, parrotfish eat certain plants off corals , which allows corals to grow better. But they are now disappearing due to lionfish. Scientists say lionfish are here to stay. But there are ways to deal with the problem. The key, says Green, is to keep lionfish numbers in check. In Florida, drivers can now go though a special training program and get certified to catch lionfish in areas where fishing is not usually allowed. And a number of restaurants have added the fish to the menu. ""It's going to be a long-term battle, but the missing sea species will come back someday,"" says Green."	['harmfulness']
What can we learn about the boy from the text?	"Germany's mystery English-speaking ""forest boy"" is said to be having trouble adjusting to conventional life. Source close to the case claim he is having difficulty sleeping in a proper bed and wants to return to the wild. Other creature comforts , such as soap, hot showers, and running water, are also "" unsettling"" the youngster. Known only as Ray, and believed to be around 17, the boy is thought to have spent at least five years sleeping rough in woods south of the German capital. He handed himself into officials on September 5, and was carrying a rucksack ,tent and sleeping bag. He told police his father had recently died after a fall and he had buried him in a shallow grave. He then walked north for a fortnight for help until he got to the German capital. Despite the bizarre nature of the story, police have said it is credible. The source said it was "" unsurprising"" the teenager found a soft bed so unusual if he had been sleeping rough for so long. ""He has indicated that he would be far more comfortable on the forest floor and would prefer to return there to sleep,"" the source added. The boy claimed that his father had taken him into the woods south of Berlin after his mother, Doreen, died in a car crash. Now detectives have begun a search for the grave, or any other place where Ryan's body might be lying. The boy is unable to tell them exactly where he buried his father, but claimed he "" followed his compass northwards"". In the meantime, they are trying to make Ray a ward of court, so that an official can be appointed to make important decisions on his behalf. DNA, fingerprint and dental records can also then be handed to Interpol so that his records can be checked against those of missing children. A police spokesman confirmed that a search had started for Ryan's grave after the boy said that he was buried under the stones "" two weeks south of Berlin"". Police are puzzled by the case, but say that everything Ray has told them so far adds up. Officials believe the teenager could be British because he speaks English but only basic German. The British Consul is also working with police to try to solve the mystery. Ray, who is 5 feet 11 inches, with blond hair, is in good physical shape and had no signs of abuse apart from a small scar that was at least 3 years old."

The passage is most likely to appear in a newspaper's _ section.	55% of deaths caused by road accidents occur in the first few minutes after a crash. Up to 85% of these deaths could be prevented if first aid were given. The first person on the scene of a road accident will almost certainly be another road user. So as a driver your knowledge of first aid could make a real difference to someone in the event of a road accident. Assess conditions *Remain calm. Judge the scene and seriousness of the collision. *Determine what has happened, how many people and vehicles are involved and the exact location. *Determine how many casualties there are, what is the severity of the injuries, whether anyone is trapped, and whether there is a danger of fire. Make safe *Make sure you stay safe and keep off the road. If you need to stop or warn approaching cars, signal to them from the pavement. Wear reflective clothing, use warning triangles, flashing lights and warning lights. Don't smoke. *If you are in a car and you come across an accident, first park safely and turn off the engine before you get out to help. Use a triangle warning danger if necessary. *Consider the safety of others. Don't move the vehicles, look out for dangers -- leaking fuel, chemicals, broken glass or dropping loads -- guide uninjured passengers to a place of safety. Call for help Dial 999 (or 112) for the emergency services. If there is no phone nearby, send two people in opposite directions to seek help. Do this as soon as you can or get someone else to do it while you deal with an injured person. You will need to tell the emergency services: *where you are *what has happened (describe the accident) *how many people are injured *whether they are breathing or bleeding. The operator will talk you through what to do while you wait for an ambulance to arrive. Apply emergency first aid *Remain calm. Reassure the victims. *Do not allow smoking or offer food or drink to casualties as this could _ urgent medical treatment.	['travel and traffic']
When did people in Britain begin to use phone cards?	Most British telephone cards are just plain green, but card collecting is becoming a popular hobby in Britain and collectors even have their own magazine, International Telephone Cards. One reason for their interest is that cards from around the world come in a wide variety of different and often very attractive designs. There are 100, 000 different cards in Japan alone, and there you can put your own design onto a blank card simply by using a photograph or a business card. The first telephone cards, produced in 1976, were Italian. Five years later the first British card appeared, and now you can buy cards in more than a hundred countries. People usually start collecting cards because they are attractive, small and light , and they do not need much space. It is also a cheap hobby for beginners, although for some people it becomes a serious business. In Paris, for example, there is a market where you can buy only telephone cards, and some French cards cost up to 4, 000 pounds. The first Japanese card has a value of about 28, 000 pounds. Most people only see cards with prices like these in their collectors magazine.	['In 1981.']

I thought Christmas would be horrible! _ ""Wow,"" I said, breaking the silence as we stood on either side of my front door. ""Thanks."" ""Okay...well... I have to go,"" she said softly. ""Okay. See you later then..."" and I closed the door. ""Who was that at the door?"" my mom asked. ""It was Jenna, my classmate."" I said. The card started off with ""Merry Christmas"", but then it said, ""I am so glad we're friends. I am sorry about what I said when we were fighting. A fight won't stop us from being friends. Besides, we said we were going to be friends even when we're eighty-two."" I stopped reading and started laughing. I couldn't believe I had forgotten what she said that day in the backyard. I couldn't believe I had been so selfish in trying to make my friends feel sorry for me."	['Friends Forever']

Which of the following can be the best title for this text?	"Electronic book publishing has many of the same risks and opportunities as electronic music publishing. By delivering text direct to the user's computer screen, the e-book could cut down costs, and allow creators to deal directly with their audience, bypassing traditional publishers and readers. But it also raises the possibility of mass piracy . Phil Rance, founder and managing director of Online Originals, a London-based e-book publisher, sums it up. ""No one wants Napster to happen to books."" Indeed, the most popular MP3 have put the frighteners on an industry that generally operates some way behind the ""bleeding edge"". The Mata Group, a leading US-based market researcher, says publishers are far too concerned about protecting their rights, ""We believe all the recent legal control over Napster is like putting a finger in a river that is already overflowing. Publishers need to deal with reality and come up with new ways to develop wide electronic distribution , asking the question: 'How can we use the certainty of wide distribution to our advantage?'"" At the moment, most publishers would like to limit the use of e-books to the person who bought them, or to the computer used to download them. If that can be done, e-books become just an extra income stream in a publishing industry that would continue to operate the way it does today, according to Terry Robinson, business manager for Adobe's e-paper group. ""If you've cracked digital rights aspect, you've cracked the market,"" he says. Robert Nichols, Books Director at BOL agrees, ""Rights management is absolutely important. Publishers just say that 'until copyright is secure, we're not going to talk'."""	['The E-book-- a New and Big Challenge']
What is Oliver's problem?	"Many students ask for advice about improving their English. There are three basic questions. The first question is about real English. Li Hao from Hubei wrote, ""I enjoy watching English films and listening to real English songs. But it takes a long time. What do you think?"" This is a great way to learn English! Talk about the film or song with your friends, and guess the meaning of the new words. Just enjoy yourself! The second question is about speaking. Sam, from Suzhou wrote. ""Our school has a foreign teacher. But I'm shy and can't speak to her. What should I do?"" When I visit China, lots of people in the street say, ""Hello! How are you? Where are you from? Do you like China?"" These are good questions to start a talk. Many people are shy when they speak English, so before you begin, take a deep breath and smile! Smiling always helps. The third question is about vocabulary. Oliver, from Anhui wrote, ""I want to remember all the new words. I write them down, but I forget them quickly. What should I do?"" Try to remember eight or ten words a day. Write them on pieces of paper and place them in your bedroom. Say the words when you see them, and change them every day. And when you're shopping, how about counting the English words, or saying the English names for everything you see?"	"[""He can't remember new words.""]"
Lonely Planet recommends these two pairs of cities because _ .	Europe is home to a variety of cultural treasures. Lonely Planet, the world's largest travel guide publisher, has offered pairs of cities for culturehungry but timepoor travelers. London and Paris It takes you about two hours to travel from London to Paris by Eurostar, a high-speed railway service. The two capital cities have been competing in fashion, art and nightlife for decades-but each secretly looks up to the other. No one can doubt the grand and impressive beauty of Paris' Louvre Museum, but if you want to save money, you cannot skip the British Museum free to visit. Compared with London, Paris has more outdoor attractions such as the beautiful green walkway La Promenade Plantee. In Paris, you'll see diners linger over red wine. While in London, you can try some afternoon tea, eat fish and chips or salted cake. Vienna and Bratislava Austrian capital Vienna and Slovakia city Bratislava are an hour apart by train. But since they are linked by the Danube River, the best way to travel is by ship. A tour of the two cities is the perfect way to experience everything from 17th century's Habsburg dynasty splendor to scifi restaurants. Vienna is famous for Mozart and imperial palaces. You can appreciate the perfect blending of architecture and nature in the grand Schonbrunn Palace, and reward yourself with a cup of Vienna coffee, which has made its way to the world's cultural heritage list. Bratislava is best known for its fine dining-the remarkable UFO restaurant. You can enjoy a meatladen dinner here in an amazing setting.	['they are close but different in many aspects']
What can we learn from the passage?	"Mike Maietta was eating lunch when he got a text message from his mom. ""Notre Dame,"" it said. "" _ !"" Mike, a senior at a Californian high school, shouted with joy. The big envelope meant that the excellent university in Indiana had offered him a place in its Class of 2013. But the $51,300 annual fee is a big trouble. So Mike and his parents are considering offers from several other colleges and are figuring out the costs of tuition, housing and holiday trips home. This year, money is the driving factor for a growing number of high school seniors, who have to decide what colleges to attend this fall. Less jobs and house prices have changed family spending. ""We're excited that Mike got into eight great schools,"" said Mike's father, an engineer at Microsoft. ""But if you consider going to school out of state, you've got to think about all of the other costs: moving, flying back and forth for the holidays. You're looking at about $3,000 a year, just for travel."" As families weigh their choices, some are going back to financial aid offices hoping help packages can be increased. Rachel Brown was happy to get a thick envelope from New York University (NYU). Although she has always wanted to live in Manhattan, she is seriously considering the University of California San Diego (UCSD), because of the high cost in New York. ""The tuition for NYU is twice as much as UCSD,"" said Rachel, 17. ""My mom doesn't want me to have a big debt when I graduate, and I don't want that either. I'd have to take out a loan of $15,000. I'll check and see if there's any way that NYU can offer me any financial aid."" More than 7.6 million American students have filled out the Free Application for Students Aid, 19.9 percent increase over last year. This month the Federal Department of Education urged college financial aid officers to give more help to certain families. A record 30,428 students applied for 2,300 places at Stanford, partly because the university increased financial aid for families earning below $10,000."	['The number of American senior students applying for financial aid is increasing.']
What is the purpose of the passage?	The Internet, mobile phones and iPads are parts of our lives now. Technology is greatly affecting all ways of our lives, from the ways we work to the ways we play. And it even causes a number of social problems such as cloning humans. We have had lots of technology and it has changed our lives a lot. We are sure that humans will continue to use more and more technology. Here are some examples of modern technology that will change our ideas and will affect our lives greatly. Global Positioning System (GPS) It's a system that uses radio signals from satellites to show exact information. It tells you where the user is on the earth in all weather conditions. It's made up of three parts: satellites, control equipments on land and receivers. Space Technology Russian and American scientists have worked together for the International Space Station, (ISS) for a long time. They hope the ISS will provide a long-lasting lab. Such a lab will bring humans limitless advantages. It's even hoped that one day space technology will take humans to their new houses in space. Underwater Robot Hercules is a kind of underwater robot with some high technology equipments. It will be used to search for ancient ships which were destroyed into the deep sea during their journey long ago. The world is changing so quickly that it's hard for us to catch up with all the new inventions because they seem to come out every month. It's important for us to learn about new technology and the role that it plays in our lives. So we should be willing to accept modem technology, or we will fall behind the times.	['To tell us technology is changing the world.']
69. Which of the following statements is Not true according to the passage?	What color do you like best? Do you like yellow, orange and red? If you do, you must be an optimist, a leader, or an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grey and blue? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are likely to be strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists tell us. They have been seriously studying the meaning of color preference, and the effects that colors have on human beings. They tell us that we don't choose our favorite color as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you do so as soon as you open your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. Black is while light and bright colors make people not only happier but more active. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one does, and a red dress adds warmth and cheer to sad winter days. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark grey. Remember, then, that if you feel low, you can always brighten your day or your life with a few colorful things. Also remember that you will know your friends (and your enemies) better when you find out what colors they like and dislike. And don't forget that anyone can guess a lot about you when you choose a piece of handkerchief.	"[""One's color preference is always changeable.""]"
What can we infer about the monkeys in Sarah's study?	"Everybody is happy as his pay rises. Yet pleasure at your own can disappear if you learn that a fellow worker has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he is known as being lazy, you might even be quite cross. Such behavior is regarded as ""all too human"", with the underlying belief that other animals would not be able to have this finely developed sense of sadness. But a study by Sarah Brosnan of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that _ , as well. The researchers studied the behaviors of some kind of female brown monkeys. They look smart. They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food happily. Above all, like female human beings, they tend to pay much closer attention to the value of ""goods and services"" than males. Such characteristics make them perfect subjects for Doctor Brosnan's study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for pieces of cucumber. However, when two monkeys were placed in separate and connected rooms, so that each other could observe what the other is getting in return for its rock, they became quite different. In the world of monkeys,grapes are excellent goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was not willing to hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to provide her token in exchange at all, the other either shook her own token at the researcher, or refused to accept the cucumber. Indeed, the mere presence of a grape in the other room (without an actual monkey to eat it) was enough to bring about dissatisfaction in a female monkey. The researches suggest that these monkeys, like humans, are guided by social senses. In the wild, they are co-operative and group-living. Such co-operation is likely to be firm only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of anger when unfairly treated, it seems, are not the nature of human beings alone. Refusing a smaller reward completely makes these feelings clear to other animals of the group. However, whether such a sense of fairness developed independently in monkeys and humans, or whether it comes from the common roots that they had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, an unanswered question."	['The monkeys may show their satisfaction with equal treatment.']
What is Not True according to the passage?	"Have you ever watched the big parade on Tian'anmen Square on October 1? Some students performed in the big parade. In order to get ready for it, this summer, many Beijing middle school students had a different kind of vacation. Instead of hanging out with friends or traveling, they trained hard for the 60th birthday of China this year. Students trained from 7:30 am to around 10:00 am or from 4 pm to 6:30 pm, because it was very hot this summer. They wore white hats, T-shirts and blue trousers. The hats and T-shirts were printed with a red logo, the number ""60"". The first week of training was PE. Students practiced standing and squatting. Then they moved on to practice the group show. When we watched the parade on TV we saw them making colorful pictures. What did the students think of their unusual summer? ""Sometimes we find it a bit tiring."" said Lu Wenqi, 13. ""But most of us think it's a great _ to take part in such an important show."" Li Hui, 15, thought the same as Lu. She said her classmates were hardly late for training. ""It's a wonderful chance for us,"" said Li. ""When my parents were in college, they also took part in a national day parade. Now it's my turn!"""

In class, to hide my score from my classmates, I _ .	"Perhaps the only test score that I remember is the 55 when I was in high school. The test was the final for a course. I remember waiting anxiously as my teacher Mr. Right passed out our papers one by one. It was a rather difficult test. I heard my classmates groaning , and I could tell by the groans that the scores weren't looking good. Mr. Right put my paper on my desk. There in big red numbers, circled to draw attention, was my score, 55! I lowered my head, and covered the score up quickly. A 55 is not something that you wanted your classmates to see. ""The scores were not very good, none of you passed,"" Mr. Right said. ""The highest score in the class was a 55."" A 55. That's me! Suddenly my sad look didn't look so bad. I had the highest score. I felt a lot better. I walked home alone that day with the low but high score. My father knew that I had a big test that day and asked me as soon as I got home, ""How did you do in your test?"" ""I made a 55,"" I said. A frown now stood on my father's face. I knew I had to explain immediately. ""But Dad, I had the highest score in the class,"" I proudly stated. I thought that explanation would make a difference. ""You failed!"" my father replied. ""But it's the highest!"" I insisted. ""I don't care what scores others had, but you failed. What matters is what you do!"" my father firmly said. For years, my father was always that way. It didn't matter what others did, it only mattered what I did and that I did it excellently. We often don't understand the wisdom of good parents until we ourselves stand in the parents' shoes. My father's words have carried me throughout life."	['covered my score up']
At the end of the passage,the author wrote about Winston Churchill in order to _ .	"I shall never forget the night,a few years ago,when Marion J.Douglas was a student in one of my adulteducation classes. He told us how tragedy had struck at his home,not once,but twice. The first time he had lost his fiveyearold daughter. He and his wife thought they couldn't bear that first loss;but,as he said,""Ten months later,God gave us another little girl and she died in five days."" This double bereavement was almost too much to bear. ""I couldn't take it,"" this father told us,""I couldn't sleep,eat,rest or relax. My nerves were entirely shaken and my confidence gone. ""At last he went to doctors;one recommended sleeping pills and another recommended a trip,but neither helped. He said,""My body felt as if it was surrounded in a vice ,and the jaws of the vice were being drawn tighter and tighter."" The tension of grief --if you have ever been paralyzed by sorrow,you know what he meant. ""But thank God,I had one child left--a fouryearold son. He gave me the solution to my problem. One afternoon as I sat around feeling sorry for myself,he asked,'Daddy,will you build a boat for me?' I was in no mood to build a boat;in fact,I was in no mood to do anything. But my son is a persistent little fellow!I had to give in. Building that toy boat took me about three hours. By the time it was finished,I realized that those three hours spent building that boat were first hours of mental relaxation and peace that I had had in months!I realized that it is difficult to worry while you are busy doing something that requires planning and thinking. In my case,building the boat had knocked worry out of the ring. So I determined to keep busy."" ""The following night,I made a list of jobs that ought to be done. Scores of items needed to be repaired. Amazingly,I had made a list of 242 items that needed attention. During the last two years I have completed most of them. I am busy so that I have no time for worry."" No time for worry!That is exactly what Winston Church ill said when he was working eighteen hours a day at the height of the war. When he was asked if he worried about his huge responsibilities,he said,""I am too busy. I have no time for worry."""	"[""support his student's solution to his problem""]"
Which is NOT TURE according to the passage?	A funny thing happened on the way to the communication revolution: we stopped talking to one another. I was walking in the park with a friend recently, and his cell phone rang, interrupting our conversation. There we were, walking and talking on a beautiful sunny day and suddenly, I became invisible, absent from the conversation. The telephone used to connect you to the absent. Now it makes people sitting next to you feel absent. Why is it that the more connected we get, the more disconnected I feel? Every advance in communication technology is a tragedy to the closeness of human interaction. With email and instant messaging over the Internet, we can now communicate without seeing or talking to one another. With voice-mail, you can conduct entire conversations without ever reaching anyone. If my mom has a question, I just leave the answer on her machine. As almost every contact we can imagine between human beings gets automated, the emotional distance index goes up. You can't even call a person to get the phone number of another person any more. Directory assistance is almost always fully automated. I am not against modern technology. I own a cell phone, an ATM card, a voice-mail system, and an email account. Giving them up isn't wise. They're a great help to us. It's some of their possible consequences that make me feel uneasy. More and more, I find myself hiding behind email to do a job meant for conversations or being relieved with voice-mail picking up because I don't really have time to talk. The industry devoted to helping me keep in touch is making me lonelier.	['The limited use of communication device brings much inconvenience to the author.']
We can learn from the passage that the writer was _ .	"As a youngster, I liked to stay at my grandfather's farm as there were stone walls around the house, which could provide me endless hours of fun. Since my first visit to the farm, I wanted to climb them. My parents would never agree. The walls were old and some stones were missing and others loose and falling. However, my idea grew so strong. Then, I had all my courage to enter the living room, where all the adults had gathered. ""I... I want to climb the stone walls,"" I said. At once voices of disagreement went up from the women in the room. ""Heavens! No! You'll hurt yourself!"" I wasn't too disappointed because the result was just as I'd expected. But before I could leave the room, I was stopped by my grandfather's loud voice. ""Hold on just a minute."" I heard him say. ""Let the boy climb the stone walls. He has to learn to do things for himself."" ""Go,"" he said to me, ""and come to see me when you get back."" For the next two and a half hours I climbed those walls, and had a good time of my life. Later I met with my grandfather to tell him about my adventures. I'll never forget what he said. ""Fred,"" he said, smiling. ""You made this day a special day just by being yourself. Always remember, there's only one person in this whole world like you, and I like you exactly as you are."" Many years have passed since then, and today I host the television program, which is being seen by millions of children throughout USA. There have been changes over the years, but what my grandfather said never left me."	['adventurous']
The bookPsychology for Medicine is mainly written for _ .	"Why does the rate of heart attacks increase during the World Cup football finals? How can we help an overweight patient to lose weight? They're just some of the topics covered in a new book by University of Sussex academics, which is helping student doctors to consider the importance of psychology in medical practice. Psychology for Medicineis the first textbook of its kind, providing medical trainees and new doctors with all the relevant psychological knowledge they need. Previously, students had to refer to many different books for the relevant psychology. The book, by Sussex psychologists Dr. Sussex Ayers and Dr. Richard de Visser, has been well received by fellow academics and medical doctors and was finished with the help of the students and staff of the Brighton and Sussex Medical School. The studentsproofread the chapters, provided ideas for the content and even modeled for the photographs. The book provides a solid grounding in psychological study relevant to medicine, along with practical tips and advice for practice. One student, Simon Hall, drew cartoons for the book. The study psychology is important for doctors for a number of reasons. Psychological and physical symptoms are highly related. Up to a third of patients will have psychological disorders, while physical causes are usually only found in around 15 per cent of people's symptoms. In treatment, a lot of the effect drugs can be due to patients believing they will recover rather than the drug itself. Dr. Ayers says, ""The important thing about this book is that it's applied science --- it shows why psychology is important to medicine and how we should use it. The book's presentation is really important. It's not just lots of theory, but full of tips and advice so that students can take what they learn in the classroom and apply it to real-life situations."""	['student doctors']
How did the author restore his faith in humanity?	Countless people long to make a difference this holiday season, yet they don't realize that opportunities to make a difference are everywhere .Here are some ideas to get you started. Organize a blank drive It is cold outside, but imagine how thousands of homeless people may feel without a home of their own, or even a blanket to keep them from the cold. Organize a blank drive for your local homeless, and ask around for donations! Practice random acts of kindness I'll never forget the time when I went to pay for my Dr. Pepper, but the sever resisted, saying my bill was paid by an anonymous guest. It's this random act of kindness that restores my faith in humanity. Bless someone by paying for their drink at Starbucks, or praising them! If you live somewhere where it snows, shovel your neighbour's snow out of their driveway for them! Whether it is as simple as praise or as complex as paying the bill, you'll never know how far your impact will reach. Say thank you Just a simple thank-you can _ , especially if they feel like their work is never noticed. Cultivate a smile on their face by being sincere and grateful for all that they do. Use your talents to help the community The best way to show your appreciation for people is by using the talents and skills you have to bless others. For me, I love to coordinate events and write , and so my way of reaching out to the community is through writing articles and creating awareness about problems we face today. If you can bake, make some delicious cookies for people to enjoy! If you can knit, put your talents to use by making clothes for children in foster care. Any talent can be used to help the community in meaningful ways. Wish you a happy, healthy and helpful holiday season.	['He got help from others']
What does the writer intend to do in this text?	Of the several films Hirokazu has made about childhood and children, this one is the most modest, but no less pleasing for its delicate style and small setting. This wise and funny film works small miracles in describing such a moment when kids turn from the wishfulness of childhood into shaping the world for themselves. The sweetly reflective hero, a sixth-grader named Koichi, starts out by wishing for a volcano to erupt. Not just any volcano, but the one that towers above his town, smoking heavily and giving off ash. An eruption would lead to a withdrawing, which would lead, at least in his mind, to a reunion with his father and kid brother, who've been living in Hakata while Koichi lives with his mother and retired grandparents in Kagoshima. The volcano, knowing nothing of this, refuses to erupt, but Koichi hears of another approach to realizing the desired miracle. One of the pleasures of I Wish is watching how kids behave -- how Koichi attacks his dinner, for example. Another pleasure is rediscovering how kids think. These kids can be logical and ever so tricky. But children's thought processes can also be fancy. A boy wishes he could play baseball like one of baseball stars, who eats curry for breakfast; so he, too, starts eating curry for breakfast, instead of practicing on the field. Another boy tries to wish his dead dog, Marble, back to life. And what does Koichi finally wish for? I wish you'd see this delightful film to find out.	['To recommend a film.']

People in Britain and the US wear informal clothes when they _ .	These days, most people in Britain and the US do not wear formal clothes. But sometimes it is important to wear the right thing. Many British people don't think about clothes very much. When they go out to enjoy themselves, they can wear almost anything. At theatres , cinemas and concerts you can put on anything you like: from beautiful suits and dresses to jeans and sweaters. Anything goes, as long as you look clean and tidy. But in Britain, as well as in the US, men in offices usually wear suits and ties and women wear dresses or skirts (not trousers). Doctors and business people always wear quite formal clothes. And in some hotels and restaurants men have to wear ties and women have to wear tidy dresses. In many ways, Americans are less formal than British people, but they are more careful with their clothes. At home, most Americans wear informal or sports clothes. But when they go out in the evening, they like to look nice. In good hotels and restaurants, men have to wear jackets and ties, and women have to wear pretty clothes. It is difficult to say exactly what people wear in Britain and the US, because everyone is different. If you are not sure what to wear, watch what other people do and then do the same. You'll feel good if you don't look too different from everyone else.	['go out to enjoy themselves']
What would be the best title for the passage?	"A class with tens or even hundreds of thousands of students might sound like a teacher's bad dream. But a big idea in higher education these days is the massive open online course, or MOOC. Some universities offer free, non-credit MOOCs available to anyone in the world. Others charge for courses and provide credits. The idea is still developing. So far, most massive open online courses are in computer science, technology, mechanics and engineering. For example, students around the world are taking a free course called ""Building a Computer Search Engine."" Two computer scientists, Sebastian Thrun and David Evans, are offering this course throughudacity.com. There are no education requirements for the course. The students watch short videos. Then, says Mr. Evans, they take informal quizzes after the videos each week for six weeks. DAVID EVANS: ""Quizzes are part of the lecture to keep students engaged and keep them thinking, for students to be able to check that they understood what we covered. Those are not graded and students try those as often as they wish. They can repeatedly watch the videos and take the quizzes whenever they want."" Students receive homework. They join online groups to exchange questions and answers about the course. The teachers hold office hours to answer questions that the students have voted to send them. They also present their own questions and observations to the students in order to help them make a deeper impression of the course. The students take a final examination to show where they rate in the class Everyone who finishes the course receives a grade and proof of completion. Top students get letters documenting their work.

Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?	"The '80s' ""important role"" in the family has also meant a greater concentration and focus on the individual. And, it has made the word ""me"" one of the most frequently used words. Everything seems to be about ""me"". This generation has a greater awareness of itself. Some people do not seem to agree that all this is self-centred. When Cai Fuchao, prefix = st1 /Beijing's publicity head, was asked to comment on the lack of responsibility of university students during the SARS period, his reply was: ""Modern university students are ambitious, knowledgeable and have a very strong sense of responsibility to the society."" As news analyst from sina.com, Pan Fengliang, echoed that, saying that blindly blaming them(for running away during the SARS outbreak)was prejudiced and unfair and not backed with evidence. No doubt, the development of information technology has contributed its bit to broadening, or bending, the minds of the 80s generation. Some people even call Gen'80 ""the E-generation"". They get in touch with each other via email, QQ, ICQ and MSN. While the people of the '60s and '70s swarmed to Shanghai to catch Luo Dayou, Gen'80s were on the BBS saying that it was ""really dumb"". ""The internet is so much more to those of the '80s than you can imagine,"" said Wu Junyong, an IT engineer who was born in 1978. In Wu's opinion, it's the Internet that separates the 70s from the 80s, ""Many of the'70s don't see why those from the '80s can spend everyday in front of a computer."" A new weekly Magazine/163.com survey last year found that 40 percent of the 7,000 people surveyed, born in the '80s, thought the computer was the most important article in life; more than 70 percent of their parents preferred the home."

We can infer from Dr Myers and Dr. Worm's paper that _ .	"When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the large animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived; the large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans. That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years and researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then. Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative . One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today's vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise. Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among marine biologists, that of the ""shifting baseline"". The notion is that people have failed to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped from a fishery comes when the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are well below that, which is a bad way to do business."	['the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%']
Martha has NOT been a	Martha Kostyra was born in Jersey City ,New Jersey on August3, 1941(she became Martha Stewart when she married Andy Stewart in 1961). Martha's dad was a pharmaceutical salesman and her wife was a housewife and a teacher. Her were fairly strict and required their children to do plenty of housework and help around the house . Martha learned how to cook and sew from her mother .She also learned about gardening by helping her father out in the yard. When Martha was in high school , she made extra money by babysitting and organizing children' parties . She was a bright student and attended Barnard College in New York city. She helped pay for her schooling through modeling jobs. In 1962, she graduated from Barnard with degrees in History and Architectural History. Before graduating from college, Martha married Andy Stewart. After college she and Andy traveled and Martha continued to model. Martha had her only child, a daughter named Alexis, in 1965. Two years later, Martha wanted to go to work. She got a job as a stockbroker in New York City and worked for six years. In 1971,Martha and Andy purchased a farmhouse they called Turkey Hill in Westport, connecticut. After quitting her job, Martha spent her time completely restoring the old farmhouse. She also studied how to cook and became an excellent gourmet chef. One day Martha decided to put her cooking skills to the test by opening up her own catering business. She cooked food and hosted large dinner parties and quickly became a success. Through her books and television appearances, Martha soon became famous . In the 1990s, she began to expand her business . She started a magazine called Martha Stewart Living, a popular newspaper column, and her own television show. The name Martha Stewart became a brand that was worth millions of dollars . In 1997, she formed a company called Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. She was president and CEO. She took the company public in 1999, selling shares in the company. At one point her estimated wealth was nearly $1 billion. She also had her own band of products at stores like Home Depot, K-Mart, Macy's and Sears. She also worked with home builders to design Martha Stewart inspired homes.	['home builder']
Which can be the best title of this passage?	"So far, there have been so many successful men and women in the world. And it's no surprise for many of us to dream of doing business when we grow up. However, Moziah Bridge tells us quite different story. Moziah Bridges is now the CEO of his Mo's Bow's company. He has already earned $200,000 by selling bow ties and other men's fashion accessories . The boy designs all the bow ties together with seven other workers in the company, including his mother and grandmother. ""Mo is the CEO of the company, but I am the CEO of Mo,"" Bridges' grandma said. About four years ago, when Bridges went shopping for bow ties, he found they were in ugly"" black and red. He wanted a change. So he asked his grandma to teach him to sew and finally he developed the talent of creating bow ties. Though his very first bow tie didn't look nice, the young sewer kept on practicing. He used colorful cloth with different pictures. Then his parents and friends started to like his works. At first he tried to sell them online to several stores in the south. Soon Mo's bow ties became popular. With the help of Dayond John, CEO of the famous US clothes brand FUBU, Bridges built his own company. Not only did Daymond John provide money for him, but also produced Bridges to the circle of fashion and business industries. Now the 13-year-old's business has developed rapidly. So you can just start now! You don't have to wait till you're older. If you have a dream, go for it!"	['A Teenage CEO and His Business']
Why should people pay attention to teeth problems?	Bad teeth may be painful and it's getting worse without treatment. They can even ruin your life. Illness of the teeth can find its way into the blood system. This can increase the chances of a heart disease or other illnesses. Experts say good care for teeth should start at birth. Mothers' milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. But dentists say a baby's mouth and early teeth should be cleaned after each feeding. Use a cloth with a little warm water. Do the same if a baby is fed with a bottle. Experts say if you decide to put your baby to sleep with a bottle, give him only water. When baby's teeth begin to appear, you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies and to use them very gently. Young children often eat toothpaste when they brush, so they should be carefully watched when they brush their teeth. Parents often ask what effect thumb sucking might have on their baby's teeth. Experts generally agree that this is fine early in life. Most children stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If _ continues, parents should talk to their children's dentist or doctor. Dentists say children should have their first dental visit by the time they are one year old. They say babies should be examined when their first teeth appear usually at around six months.

Why is Neil Armstrong's death described as 'a surprise to many'? Because _ .	"Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, has died at the age of 82. Many people paid tribute to the former astronaut. But other people feel regret that no human has been back to the moon since 1972, just three years after Armstrong landed on it and gave his famous ""giant leap for mankind"" speech. Elliot Pulham, Chief Executive of the Space Foundation, thinks that America's space agency NASA should get more money, like in the 1960s, during the moon landings programme, when astronauts went to the moon. ""In this age of limited goals and tiny NASA budgets, Armstrong is a reminder of what our nation was once capable of,"" he said. Armstrong died because of heart problems after surgery. His recovery seemed to be going well, and his death was a surprise to many people. His family described him as a ""reluctant American hero"" and said: ""Honour his example of service, and the next time you walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink."" Speaking from the White House, Barack Obama said Armstrong was ""among the greatest of American heroes - not just of his time, but of all time"". He added: ""And when Neil stepped on the moon for the first time, it was a moment of human achievement that will never be forgotten."" Buzz Aldrin flew with Armstrong on Apollo 11. He was the second man to walk on the moon. He said he was very sad at the death of his good friend and companion. ""When I look at the moon I remember that special moment, over forty years ago, when Neil and I stood on the moon,"" he said. ""Looking back at our brilliant blue planet Earth hanging in the darkness of space, I realized that even though we were farther away from Earth than two humans had ever been, we were not alone. Almost the entire world took that memorable journey with us. I know many millions of people around the world will join me in mourning the death of a true American hero and the best pilot I ever knew. My friend Neil took the small step but giant leap that changed the world and will always be remembered as a historic moment in human history."" In the US, people felt that he represented the achievement of a past age of American greatness. Today, things are very different: NASA has cancelled a number of missions because they don't have enough money. Former astronaut Eugene Cernan, the last man on the moon, said: ""Neil did something that people thought was impossible."" Others complained about the state of the US. Journalist Andrew Pasternak wrote: ""It will take longer to rebuild lower Manhattan after 9/11 than it took to build an entire space program and send a man to the moon."" Of course, NASA has its modern successes. Its engineers have landed a nuclear-powered robot on Mars. There will also be another Mars mission. It will drill below the planet's surface. But these achievements are not as exciting as Armstrong's. NASA administrator Charles Bolden expressed that in his tribute. ""As we enter this next era of space exploration, we are standing on the shoulders of Neil Armstrong,"" he said. Armstrong was disappointed by what NASA has become. Blogger Eric Berger saw an email from Armstrong and other former astronauts. It expressed frustration at the current problems at NASA and quoted Yogi Berra, an American baseball legend: ""If you don't know where you are going, you might not get there."""

The best title for this passage may be _ .	"For years and years people have been saying that railways are dead. ""We can do without railways,"" people say--as if cars and planes have made railways unnecessary. We all keep hearing that trains are slow, lose money and are dying. But this is far from the truth. In these days of expensive oil, railways have become highly _ with cars and planes. If you want to carry people or goods from place to place, they're cheaper than planes. And they have much in common with planes. A plane goes in a straight line and so does a railway. What is more, a railway takes you from the heart of a city center. It doesn't stop you as a car does on crowded roads. And no plane or car can ever carry as many goods as one train does. Far from being dead, railways are much alive. Modern railway lines give you a comfortable journey. Where else can you eat well, sleep comfortably, feel safe and enjoy the scene while you are traveling at the same time? And we are only the beginning, for we have just entered the age of super-fast trains, which are traveling 150 miles an hour and more. Soon we will be wondering why we spent so much on highways and planes we can't fly in because we don't have enough money to buy the oil."	['Railways, not the End, but the Beginning']
Which of the following words can best describe Shari?	"My granddaughter, Shari, owns The Berry Factory in Sacramento, California, and her mother, Joan, and I were helping with the Valentine's Day rush. We'd dipped hundreds of berries, arranged gift baskets and packaged orders to be shipped around the country. By the end of the day, the two middle-aged women, Joan and I, were exhausted. Shari didn't seem tired. That was typical Shari. Though she was very busy, I'd seen her give away berries to everybody -- parking attendants, mail carriers and hairdressers. ""For me?"" they would say, bursting into a smile. As a ""thank you"", Shari took us out for dinner. But there was a 45-minute wait at her favorite restaurant. ""No big deal. There's another place just up the road,"" she said, driving us there. This time we walked right in. When the waitress came to take our drink orders, Shari reached into her handbag, pulling something out.

Many people are streaming to see the Egyptian statue to _ .	"Michael Jackson fans are coming a Chicago museum to see a 3,000 year old Egyptian statue which looks remarkably like the late king of pop. Staff have been since Jackson's death as thousands of mourners visit the exhibition to pay tribute to the star. The statue has skinny cheeks and - most strikingly - a tipless nose. It is on display at the Ancient Egypt exhibition at The Field Museum in the United States. The bust was bought in Cairo in 1889 and has been on display at the museum for 21 years. But its popularity has risen rapidly since Michael Jackson's death after fans started writing about the ancient statue on internet blogs. The bust was carved during the New Kingdom Period, which ran between 1550 BC to 1050 BC. This was around the same time as famous Egyptians Ramesses and King Tut. The museum's 4,500 daily visitors are banned from touching or kissing the statue, which is protected behind a glass screen. Astonished fans stand admiring the statue and discussing its likeness with others who have travelled to see it. Darnell Williams, the director of guest relations, said some fans were treating a visit to the museum like a pilgrimage . He said: ""The statue has been here for years but interest has been raised since Michael Jackson's death. People are coming from all over the country to see the statue and compare its likeness to the king of pop. ""They want to touch and kiss the model like it is some sort of God but it is behind a screen to protect it from damage. Once people see it they are astounded and can't stop talking about its likeness. It really is remarkable."" James Phillips, manager of near east and north African exhibits, said little was known about the origins of the model. He said: ""The likeness is astonishing but I think it is probably a coincidence. We do not believe Michael Jackson ever visited the museum or saw the exhibit and there is therefore little chance he based his image on it. We believe the model is missing a nose because early Christians or Muslims removed noses from paintings and models to make them non-human."	['show their respect to Jackson']
What is the main topic of this passage?	"Scientists have long puzzled over how iguanas, a group of lizards mostly found in the Americas, came to live in the isolated Pacific islands of Fiji and Tonga. Some scientists used to suppose that they must have traveled there on a raft, a journey of around 5,000 miles from South America to the islands. There are documented cases of iguanas reaching remote Caribbean islands and the Galapagos Islands on floating logs. But new research in January by Brice Noonan and Jack Sites suggested that iguanas may have simply walked to Fiji and Tonga when the islands were still a part of an ancient southern supercontinent. The ancient supercontinent was made up of present-day Africa, Australia, Antarctica and parts of Asia. If that's the case, the island species would need to be very old. Using ""molecular clock"" analysis of living iguanas' DNA, Noonan and Sites found that, sure enough, _ has been around for more than 60 million years--easily old enough to have been in the area when the islands were still connected by land bridges to Asia or Australia. Fossils uncovered in Mongolia suggest that iguanid ancestors did once live in Asia. Though there's currently no fossil evidence of iguanas in Australia, that doesn't necessarily mean they were never there. ""The fossil record of this continent is surprisingly poor and cannot be taken as evidence of true absence,"" the authors write. So if the iguanas simply walked to Fiji and Tonga from Asia or possibly Australia, why are they not also found on the rest of the Pacific islands? Noonan and Sites say fossil evidence suggests that iguana species did once inhabit other islands, but went extinct right around the time when humans settled in those islands. But Fiji and Tonga have a much shorter history of human presence, which may have helped the iguanas living there to escape extinction. The researchers say that their study can't completely rule out the rafting theory, but it does make the land bridge theory ""far more reasonable than previously thought."""	['By raft or by land -- how did iguanas reach the tiny Pacific islands?']
_ was also a kind of money used by the people in some islands.	People use money to buy food, books and hundreds of other things they need. When they work, they usually get paid in money. Most of the money used today is made of metal or paper. But in the time long ago, people used to use all kinds of things as money. One of the first kinds of money was shells. In China, cloth and knives were used as money. Elephant tusks , monkey tail and salt were used in some parts of the world. Rice was also a kind of money used by the people in some islands. Some animals were used as money, too. The first copper coins were made in China. They were round and had a square hole in the center. Different countries have used different metals for their money. Later, some countries began to make coins of gold and silver . But gold and silver were heavy to carry when people needed a lot of coins to buy something expensive. The Chinese were the first to use paper money. The first paper money looked more like a note from one person to another than the paper money used today. Money has had an interesting story from the days of shell money till today.	['Rice']
The suggested plan was to _ .	Thomas Alva Edison was awarded more patents on inventions than any other American. When he died in 1931, Americans wondered how they could best show their respect for him. One suggestion was that the nation observe a minute or two of total blackout(,).

Electric power was too important to the country. Shutting it off for even a short time would have led to complete confusion . A blackout was out of the question. On the day of Edison's funeral ,many people silently dimmed their lights.

In the girl's long painstaking training process, _ .	"The latest research suggests that the key factor separating geniuses from the merely accomplished is not I.Q., a generally bad predictor of success. Instead, it's purposeful practice. Top performers spend more hours practising their craft. If you wanted to picture how a typical genius might develop, you'd take a girl who possessed a slightly above average language ability. It wouldn't have to be a big talent, just enough so that she might gain some sense of distinction. Then you would want her to meet, say, a novelist, who coincidentally shared some similar qualities. Maybe the writer was from the same town, had the same family background, or shared the same birthday. This contact would give the girl a vision of her future self. It would give her some idea of a fascinating circle who might someday join. It would also help if one of her parents died when she was 12, giving her a strong sense of insecurity and fuelling a desperate need for success. Armed with this ambition, she would read novels and life stories of writers without end. This would give her a primary knowledge of her field. She would be able to see new writing in deeper ways and quickly understand its inner workings. Then she would practise writing. Her practice would be slow, painstaking and error-focused. By practising in this way, she delays the automating process. Her mind wants to turn conscious, newly learned skills into unconscious, automatically performed skills. By practising slowly, by breaking skills down into tiny parts and repeating, she forces the brain to internalize a better pattern of performance. Then she would find an adviser who would provide a constant stream of feedback, viewing her performance form the outside, correcting the smallest errors, pushing her to take on tougher challenges. By now she is redoing problems--how do I get characters into a room--dozens and dozens of times. She is establishing habits of thought she can call upon in order to understand or solve future problems. The primary quality our young writer possesses is not some mysterious genius. It's the ability to develop a purposeful, laborious and boring practice routine; the latest research takes some of the magic out of great achievement. But it underlines a fact that is often neglected. Public discussion is affected by genetics and what we're ""hard-wired"" to do. And it's true that genes play a role in our capabilities. But the brain is also very plastic. We construct ourselves through behavior."	['her writing turns into an automatic pattern of performance']
What's the best title for this article?	"Peter Qwen has been making wigs since the 1980s . He has made wigs for the stars of more than seventy movies ,including Tom Hanks in Philadelphia, Johnny Depp in Sleepy Hollow and Nicole Kidman in The Others. One of his biggest jobs so far has designed the hair and makeup for the three Lord o f the Ring movies . He had just six weeks to design and make more than a hundred wigs, each one a different style, color, shape and length. The hair and makeup in a movie are just as important as the costumes or the sets. Over the years, Peter has made actors look older, younger, healthy and sick. For one movie he even made a female actor look like a man! ""What people don't realize about wigs is that we are not always making people more beautiful,"" he says. ""Often we are covering up beauty and making them look ordinary."" All Peter's wigs are handmade using human hair, so they look as real as possible.

It can be inferred from the passage that----	"Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our own Milky Way and in other galaxies. This is a major achievement because,in terms,planets are very small and do not give out light. Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove _ more difficult. The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. In our own solar system,for example,Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. Only the Earth provides ideal conditions,and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve . Whether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its ""sun"". Imagine a star up to twenty times larger, brighter and hotter than our own sun. A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. On the contrary, if the star were small,the life--supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. But how would we fund such a planet? At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life. _ . It is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth--based telescopes. Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. Even a telescope in orbit round the earth like the very successful Hubble telescope,would not be suitable because of the dust particles in our solar system. A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. Once we detected a planet,we would have to find a way of blocking out the light from its star, so that we would be able to ""see"" the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere. In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life,rather than ""little green men"" . The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. For most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. As Earth-dwellers,we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. But this hope only exists in science fiction. If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet,it would completely change our view of ourselves. As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed,""Finding life elsewhere would change everything. No human efforts or thought would be unchanged by it."""	['finding life on another planet will be shocking news']
Some animals must be fed separately because _ .	My friend, Victor, is a zoo keeper in the National Zoo. His work is very interesting but it is hard. Sometimes it is dangerous, too. Every morning the zoo keepers have to get up at five to prepare the food for the animals. Each kind of animal is given special food. For example, the lions must be given meat; the deer must be given grass and leaves; and the parrots must be given fruit and nuts. Sometimes some animals won't let the others eat their food. If this happens, each of them must be fed separately . Every morning each cage must be washed by the zoo keepers. This can be dangerous, especially with lions and tigers. To make the work easier, the animals are locked in the sleeping compartments while the cages are being washed. When the animals are sick, the zoo keepers must look after them. Each sick animal is kept in a separate cage and given medicine. Sometimes they must be given injections. It is not easy to inject a sick lion! All the keepers live near the zoo. Each of them has a small house. There he lives with his family. They do not have holidays on Sundays and public holidays. Instead, each of them has a day off during the week. Each keeper has a holiday on a different day from that of the other keepers. The most important job of the keepers is to look after the safety of the visitors. People must be prevented from doing dangerous things. Many people have been injured because they did careless things, like putting their hands into the lion's cage. ,.

After a study of 800 persons with high blood pressure, they found that after 6 months, those devoted to weight-loss exercise and eating a low-salt, low-fat food lost about 13 pounds and became fitter. Plus, 35% of them dropped into the ""normal"" category. This week, Dr. Alan Duckworth will tell you how these people reduce their blood pressure to a level similar to what's achieved with Hypertension drugs."

In space, the three astronauts will complete the following tasks EXCEPT _ .	JIUQUAN, China--China's Shenzhou-9 spacecraft blasted off at 6:37 pm Saturday, from a remote desert in western China, sending a crew of three, including the country's first female astronaut, into space. The successful launch, powered by a Long March 2F rocket, was shown live on state television Saturday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert in western China. The Chinese astronauts will complete the country's first manned space docking mission , an important step in Beijing's ambitious plan to build a permanent space station by 2020. Possible future missions could include sending a man to the moon. The crew is expected to spend more than 10 days in space and dock with the Tiangong-1 space lab module, which China launched in September 2011. Two of them will live and work inside the module to test its life-support systems, while the third will remain in the capsule to deal with any unexpected emergencies. China first launched a man into space in 2003, followed by a two-man mission in 2005 and a three-man trip in 2008 that featured the country's first spacewalk. In November 2011, the unmanned Shenzhou-8 successfully docked twice with Tiangong-1 by remote control. The manned docking would be considered a milestone for China's space program. China is hoping to join the United States and Russia as the only countries to send independently maintained space stations into orbit . It is already one of just three nations to have launched manned spacecraft on their own. The program is a source of enormous national pride for China, reflecting its rapid economic and technological progress and ambition to rank among the world's leading nations.	['walking in space']

When the Thais give the author surprised looks, she feels _ .	I was born in Thailand, where I feel at home. I am used to jumping on to a song taow (red taxi), and squeezing in between two strangers. I am used to bargaining at the market to get a shirt that I like. I love telling bilingual jokes and I am used to the surprised looks I get from the Thais when I can speak their language fluently. Every two years my family goes to America for the summer, and every two years my world is turned upside down. The prices of everything are three times what they were in Thailand, but there is the sweet drink Dr. Pepper! And Bluebell Ice-cream! And everything you could imagine! I am amazed at it all, but the biggest change for me is the people. There are white people everywhere. I am not tall but average , my yellow hair is no longer out of place, and speaking English no longer draws looks. I should feel comfortable. I'm not out of place anymore, and nobody is looking at me, but I feel like they are. Now I feel out of place and different. I'm not used to giving people handshakes and hugs when I meet them for the first time. I get looks when I have trouble figuring out how much money to pay. I know different music, different places, and different fashion. I can't understand these people who have never left their town or city. Still, there are quite a few _ about living overseas. I get to meet people from all over the world, and I know how to adjust to different cultures and places. I have been to places most people see only in geography books. Still, being so different makes it hard to know who you are. I'm not Thai, but I am not American either. I am a mix of both cultures, a third culture kid.	['normal']
Which of the following statement is RIGHT?	A blocked airway can kill someone in three to four minutes, but it can take more than eight minutes for an ambulance to arrive. So a simple procedure such as opening someone's airway can save their life while they're waiting for emergency medical help. This means you're more likely to give first aid to someone you know than a stranger. There are many misconceptions surrounding first aid. Below are the 'most popular' ones with details of what you should do. You should put butter or cream on a burn. The only thing you should put on a burn is cold water - keep the butter for cooking. Put the affected area under cold running water for at least ten minutes. The best way to treat bleeding is to put the wound under a tap. If you put a bleeding wound under a tap you wash away the body's clotting agents and make it bleed more. Instead put pressure on the wound with whatever is available to stop or slow down the flow of blood. As soon as possible call 999. Keep pressure on the wound until help arrives. Nosebleeds are best treated by putting the head back. If you put the head back during a nosebleed, all the blood goes down the back of the airway. Instead advise them to tilt their head forwards and ask the person to pinch the end of their nose and breathe through their mouth. You need lots of training to do first aid. You don't - what you mostly need is common sense. You can learn enough first aid in a few minutes to save someone's life - whether it's from a book, attending a course or watching videos online. Remember: anyone can save a life	['You can learn first aid in quickly in different ways.']
From the text,we know that the body can still feel comfortable	"You hear this,""No wonder you are fat.All you ever d0 is eat.""You feel sad.""I skip my breakfast and supper.I run every morning and evening.What else can I do?"" Basically you can do nothing.Your genes,not your life habits,determine your weight and your body constantly tries to maintain it. Albert Stunkard of the University of Pennsylvania found from experiments that""80 percent of the children of two fat parents become fat,as compared with no more than 14.percent of the children of two parents of normal weight."" How can obese people become thinner through dieting? Well,dieting can be effective.but the health costs are great. Jules Hirsch,a research physician at Rockefeller University,did a study of eight fat people.They were.given a liquid formula providing 600 calories a day.After more than 10 weeks,the subjects lost on average 45 kg.But after leaving the hospital,they all regained the weight. The results were surprising:by metabolic measurement,fat people who lost large amounts of weight seemed like they were starving.They had psychiatric problems.They dreamed of food or of breaking their diet They were anxious and depressed.Some wanted to kill themselves.They hid food in their rooms. Researchers warn that it is possible that weight reduction doesn't result in normal weight,but in an abnormal state lust like that of starved non.obese people. Thin people, however,suffer from the opposite.They have to make a great effort to gain weight Ethan Sims of the University of Vermont got prisoners to volunteer to gain weight.In four to six months--they ate as much as they could.They succeeded in increasing their weight by 20 to 25 percent. But months after the study ended,they were back to normal weight and stayed there. This did not mean that people are completely without hope in controlling their weight.It means that those who tend to be fat will have to constantly battle their genetic inheritance if they want to significantly 1ower their weight. The findings also provide evidence for something scientists thought was true--each person has a comfortable weight range.The range might be as much as 9kg.Someone might weigh 60--69kg without too much effort.But,going above or below the natural weight range is difficult.The body resists by feeling hungry or full and changing.the metabolism to push the weight back to the range it seeks."

"The best title for this passage is"" _ """	"Art museums are places where people can learn about various cultures. The increasingly popular ""design museums"" that are opening today, however, perform quite a different role. Unlike most art museums, the design museum shows objects that are easily found by the general public These museums sometimes even place things like fridges and washing machines in the center of the hall Pele have argued that design museums are often made use of as advertisements for new industrial technology. But their role is not simply a matter of sales-it is the honoring of excellently invented products. The difference between the window of a department store and the showcase in a design museum is that the first tries to sell you something, while the second tells you the success of a sale. One advantage of design museums is that they are places where people feel familiar with the exhihits. Unlike the average art museum visitors, design museum visitors seldom feel frightened or puzzled. This is partly because design museums clearly show how and why mass-produced products work and look as they do, and how design has improved the quality of our lives. Art museum exhibits, on the other hand, would most probably fill visitors with a feeling that there is something between their understanding. In recent years, several new design museums have opened their door. Each of these museums has tried to satisfy the public's growing interest in the field with new ideas. London's Design Museum, for example, shows a collection of mass-produced objects from Zippo lighters to electric typewriters to a group of Italian fish-tins. The choices open to design museums seem far less strict than those to art museums, and visitors may also sense the humorous part of our society while walking around such exhibits as interesting and unusually attractive toys collected in our everyday life."

Just then his grandmother walked into the room. ""I want to be extreme. Would you really let me do that? You always worry about my safety!"" said Jason. ""You will have to follow some rules,"" said his grandmother. ""You can only ride in the park -- never on the streets. You have to promise to wear a helmet . If you hurt yourself too much, I have the right to take your skateboard away. Is it a deal?"" ""You bet!"" Jason was so excited that he jumped off the sofa. A week later he had a board and a helmet. On Saturday, his grandmother dropped him off near the park. He was happy to have a grandmother who let him try new things. Kids in the park were moving quickly up and down the ramps . They flew into the air and landed as easily as birds. When he watched the X games, Jason felt like he was doing the tricks himself. But watching these kids up close, he knew that none of it was going to be easy. He felt a little bit scared. Very slowly he carried his board to the ramp. Taking a deep breath, he put his right foot on the board. He kicked off with his left foot. For a few seconds he glided along, just waiting to fall. Then he came to a stop. Kicking off again, he waited for the worst to happen. Again, he stayed up. The third time he kicked, lost his balance, and fell hard on his left knee. It hurt, but it was no big deal! Why had he been so scared? Now he felt calm because things had gone wrong, and he was fine! Next time he kicked off harder and went fast and farther. ""Excellent!"" said a girl as she passed him.

What is Rohit Talwar's attitude toward new job opportunities in space?	"Make your office space MANY of us spent our childhoods dreaming of becoming astronauts. However, the hard reality is that only a select few will make it. But does that mean you'll never get the chance to work in space? Not necessarily. Space X, a private space company based in California, US, published a list of job vacancies last month. These ""open positions"" are not only for astronauts, and they all sound just as cool. One of the most interesting space jobs that you may have never heard of is ""chief sniffer"" . NASA has already hired a chief sniffer named George Aldrich, whose job is to smell materials and components before they are used in spacecrafts. Using your nose at work might sound a little strange, but the job is actually crucial. A spacecraft is of limited size and ly high temperature, which makes smells stronger inside of it. And once a spacecraft is launched, astronauts ""have no way of escaping"" unpleasant smells, Aldrich told The Telegraph. More importantly, smelling objects can help identify dangerous chemicals that could threaten astronauts' health. Another job vacancy, the ""space tour guide"", may seem a little ahead of its time --after all, what's the point of hiring a tour guide when there aren't any tourists there? But in fact, many private companies are now providing space trips, and wealthy space enthusiasts such as Justin Bieber and Sarah Brightman have already signed up for tours. It may not be long before space becomes one of the top travel destinations for Earthlings. Being a space tour guide requires rich knowledge of astronomy , astrophysics geography and history to help passengers get the most out of their journey. Tour guides also need to be excellent storytellers so that passengers can experience the true awe of space travel. Astronauts often spend weeks or even months in a small capsule with the same group of people, which is why a ""space psychologist"" is also needed to help astronauts overcome mental challenges like feeling bored and lonely. ""We're crossing the boundaries between science fiction and reality,"" said Rohit Talwar, chief executive of US company Fast Future Research. ""Things we've seen in the past in movies are now becoming genuine career opportunities. """	['pleased']
What is the best title of the passage?	Recently, tests have proved that Beethoven died from lead poisoning. Bill Walsh directed the Beethoven Research Project. Mr Walsh and his team examined pieces of bone belonging to Beethoven. They found a large amount of lead in the bone pieces. They said the lead levels were equal to those found in pieces of his hair in earlier studies of other scientists. Genetic tests proved the bone pieces and hair came from Beethoven. The researchers also examined bone fragments( from someone else who lived during the same period. Both were from the top of the skull. The fragments from Beethoven had more lead than those from the other person. Their study didn't find measurable levels of cadmium or mercury , which scientists used to consider were the causes of his health problems. Beethoven was sick for much of his life. He experienced strong stomach pains, a sign of lead poisoning, and a change of personality when he was around 20. He also got angry easily, and suffered from depression and hearing loss. His health problems became worse as Beethoven grew older. Walsh said the lead levels found in Beethoven's skull suggested the metal might have been present in his body for many years. He said although there had been recognized cases of deafness caused by lead poisoning, there was no strong evidence to suggest that lead poisoning was the cause of Beethoven's deafness. Ludwig van Beethoven visited many doctors to find a cure for his health problems. In a letter he wrote to a friend, he asked researchers to examine his body after he died so that other people would not have to suffer as he did.	['Beethoven died from lead poisoning.']
The writer's anxiety attacks were mainly caused by_.	Growing up, I knew I was different. My father had left and he never came back. As I later discovered, the abandonment triggered my anxiety attacks. I feared being alone, unwanted, unpopular, and unloved. My first attack came in a ninth-grade class: The teacher asked me to walk in front of the class, but I couldn't do it- I was soaked in sweat, shaking. My symptoms began every morning from the moment when I stepped inside the school building. Throughout my childhood, I was no stranger to the doctor's office. My mother tried everything she could in hope of a breakthrough. There were times I thought suicide could be the only way to make the pain stop. By age 16, I had shut down socially. Most of my peers were going to parties, playing sports, and dating. But I was a prisoner in my own home. Then one Sunday morning, my wake-up call came from a magazine article. Freddie Prinze, Jr. was on the cover. The article detailed the pain of losing his father at a young age. I felt as though I were reading my own life story. The only difference? He was now a success. That article inspired me to explore a new treatment option for myself. I wanted to turn my life around as well. So I hit the library and the Internet, and I began to realize how my negative thoughts controlled my physical well-being. Immediately, I made a plan to take charge of my life. Shortly after following the items I had listed, I was able to stop seeing a therapist. I never returned to high school, but I did go to college. After graduation, I pursued a career in television news. My relationships have changed for the better, too. I've made new friends and reconnected with many from my past The anxiety isn't completely gone, but whenever it returns, I know the feeling will pass, and know I have the power to change my life, only if I will give myself a chance.

The author is most probably _ .	"He wasn't sick. He wasn't old. And he wasn't losing. He had a very good final season and won his last game in 2008. And then he walked away. Lloyd Carr was 62. That's a few years earlier than retirement age in America and many years earlier than some college football coaches say goodbye. How was Carr, who coached University of Michigan, able to leave so easily? "" It can be _ ,"" Carr admits. ""The Saturday afternoons and the crowds. And when you win, there's nothing like it."" But the job needs hard work. The pressure to win. The endless training. The hours are so long that sleeping at the office is a normal thing. I reported Carr's career at Michigan from 1995 to 2007. I saw him run onto the field before 100,000 cheering fans, saw him enjoy a share of a national championship with a 12-0 season. And when I visited him recently in retirement, the difference was noticeable. He seems much calmer, relaxed, more at peace. He says, ""As much fun as it is, there's a period when you have other things to deal with."" Carr knew he wanted to travel, see the world, read more, do other work. He is now connected with a children's hospital, does some speaking, plays golf, and enjoys relaxing with his wife, Laurie, and their many grandchildren. Several of today's big-name coaches are all about Carr's retirement age. Nick Saban turns 59 this month. Jim Tressel is 57. Frank Beamer is already 63. None of them seems to be slowing down. So when, I ask Carr, is the right moment to leave such a great job? He thinks. Finally, he says, ""When you love it and can still walk away from it. That's the right moment."""	['a sports reporter']
This article is written to advise people _ .	Smartphones, poor sight Look around and you'll see people busy on their smartphones. Smartphones do make our lives easier . But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of British people own smartphones and they spend an average of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the UK who suffer from shortsightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at things closer to your face, the blinking slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphones in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger, too much light enters your eyes. This can do harm to the eyes and cause a disease called glaucoma . While you're probably not going to stop using to your _ , there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes. Hold your phone at least 30 centimeters away from your eyes when using it. Take a break every hour and try the following: look at something at least five meters from you and then focus on the tip of your nose. Repeat this several times. It should reduce the discomfort in your eyes.	['to use smart phones properly']
Many scientists have different opinions on the search for a renewable energy because _ .	"Most respected scientists agree that we need to find another source of energy- and quickly. If we continue to burn oil and pump carbon into the atmosphere, then the effects on global climate will lead to global disasters even before the oil disappear. The British government has set a target of a 20 percent reduction in carbon emission by 2010. Central to this policy is the search for alternative, renewable forms of energy production---and this is where the serious disagreement among scientists begins. Here, two people active in the debate about wind farms give their points of view. Simon Shearman ""First, a few facts about wind power. Wind is one of the cheapest of the new, renewable forms of energy. It is extremely safe---no member of the public has ever been injured at a wind farm. The shallow waters around Britain are the windiest in Europe---ideal locations for wind farms and, by 2010, up to ten percent of the electricity used in the UK could be produced by wind power. I find it annoying and frustrating that the biggest objection that opponents of wind farms can come up with is that the crisis of global warming is real and something must be done urgently."" Alice Evans ""The simple, obvious fact is that wind turbines cannot generate electricity if the wind is too light or too strong and it often is. Many scientists estimate that wind turbines generally produce only 30 percent of their capacity . This is not a reliable enough supply to enable us to close down conventional power stations. In fact, wind power can't keep up with the growth of the demand for electricity, let alone replace other sources of power."" It's a topic that is causing heated debate around the country---but one we must address before it's too late---before the oil runs out."

Why did Lucy throw a stone into a wild beehive?	Recordings of angry bees are enough to send big, tough African elephants running away, a new study says. Beehives -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops. In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today, Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away. Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family. From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place. Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times. She hasn't tested enough groups yet to know, but her initial results were promising enough to begin trials with farmers. She has now begun placing speakers in the fields to see if elephants are frightened away.	['To record the sound of bees.']
What's the main idea of the passage?	"When she graduates from Columbia University next year with a master's degree in Public health, Eric Wheeler is hoping to get a job in international reproductive health. The 26-year-old post-graduate has always wanted to work in public service. But public service doesn't pay much, and her two-year program at Columbia costs about $50,000 a year with living expenses. She has a scholarship from Columbia that covers just $4,000 a year and has taken out loans to pay for the rest. She worries that she will spend years paying back her student loans and not have money left over to put away in an IRA. Wheeler is wondering what she can do to ease the pain of being in debt. Is there anything she can do to handle the debt? The good news is that in 2007, Congress recognized that there were so many students in Wheeler's position that it passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. There were two programs established by this act that Wheeler should look into. The first is the income-based repayment plan, which allows lower-income graduates with a lot of debt to reduce their monthly payments. Depending on a graduate's income and level of debt, the program, which goes into effect July 1, could limit his or her annual educational loan debt repayment to 15 percent of discretionary income ,said Peter Mazareas, vice charman of the College Saving Foundation. The second is the public service loan forgiveness plan, in which the federal government will forgive the remaining debt of borrowers who make 10-year loan payment while working full time in public-service jobs. But the graduate must have a certain loan which is listed in the plan. Depending on the level of debt Wheeler ends up with and how much she repays over 10 years, Mazareas said she could end up with about $75,000 of her debt forgiven. "" Tipically, it is projected that a borrower who performs public service under this program will repay only about one-fourth to one-half as much money as a borrower who does not"", he said. He also pointed out that public service is broadly defined and includes any government and nonprofit organization job."	['The federal government is trying to relieve graduates from heavy debt.']

Why Kekula took her father home?	"Fatu Kekula is a hero. The 22-year-old Liberian nursing student, in her final year, managed to save the members of her immediate family from the Ebola virus, all without the help and convenience of a hospital. Kekula reduced the rate to 25 percent. Four of her family members were infected with the virus. Her father, Moses, her mother, Victoria, her sister, Vivian and her 14-year-old cousin, Alfred Winnie. Sadly, Kekula's cousin _ the virus. It's also impressive to note that while Kekula was treating her family members she managed to avoid Ebola entirely. On July 27, Kekula's father, Moses, went to a hospital in Kanata, after his blood pressure rose sharply. The only reason the hospital had a bed to offer him was because someone had just died. But the staff in the hospital didn't realize the patient died from an Ebola infection. Shortly, after he was admitted to the hospital, Moses developed a fever, started vomiting and was suffering from diarrhea. Once nurses started dying of Ebola, the hospital shut down and Moses had to leave. Kekula drove 90 minutes to Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, to seek treatment. Three hospitals turned them away because there is no spare bed for patients at all. Kekula made the drive back to Kanata to another hospital. They told Moses he had typhoid fever and did very little to treat him. So Kekula took him home. Once he was there, he infected three other family members. Her mother, sister and their cousin who was living with them. Kekula only lost one patient, her cousin. Her method proved so effective that international aid workers, including UNICEF, began teaching it to others in West Africa who may not be able to get to hospitals for treatment. Her father, mother and sister were already recovering when space became available at the JFK Medical Center on August 17. Alfred passed away at the hospital the next day. Kekula's father, Moses said, ""I'm very, very proud. She saved my life through the almighty God."""	['Because they were turned down by hospitals and little can be done to her father.']

Which is the main idea of this passage?	"For a 400-year-old art form, opera had a bad fame: overweight actresses singing the words which were hard to understand in one of those romance languages you were supposed to learn in high school. And with tickets costing as much as $145 a performance, opera goers also had a certain appearance in people's mind: rich, well-dressed and old.[:] But now opera companies around the country are loosening their ties and kicking off their shoes in an attempt to keep opera alive and take it to a younger and not so wealthy audience. Opera producers have found that to attract this crowd, they need to make the opera closer to common people. Because young people don't or won't come to the opera, companies are bringing the opera to them, giving performances in such unusual places as parks, libraries and public schools. The Houston Grand Opera's choice is the public library, where it performs ""mobile operas"" shortened versions of child-friendly operas. This summer's production is Hansel & Gretel. By performing smaller versions of large productions, producers are able to make people interested while keeping costs at a reasonable level. The San Francisco Opera, which will be celebrating its 75th anniversary this year, is staging Cinderella free of charge, keeping costs down by employing students from its Young Artists' Training Program."

What can we learn from the passage?	Tom grows the nicest vegetables and fruits, and the most beautiful flowers in his village. Plants grow in Tom's garden all through the year.Tom cuts some flowers for his sitting-room table and eats some fruits and vegetables, but he sells most of them in the market. His vegetables, fruits and flowers are so wonderful that they sell much more quickly in the market than those of other villages. How does Tom grow these beautiful plants? He is so lazy that he just sits under his orange tree with his radio. He listens to music all day. That is quite true. Tom plants things in spring, summer, autumn and winter. After that he sits with his radio. And everything grows. It is the music that does work. Tom knows more clearly that music makes the biggest vegetables and fruits and the most beautiful flowers. Plants love music as much as people.	['Plants also like listening to music.']
Who of the following says yes to the idea of paying students?	"Recently we asked for people's opinions about paying students to encourage them to come to class and get higher scores on tests. Some American schools are doing this. More of the people were against the idea than were for it. Some people said paying students sends a message that money is the only reason they should study for. Steven from prefix = st1 /Chinasays students should study for knowledge. Money may make a difference in the short term, he says, but we should think about the long term. Zhao Jing Tao, a college student in China, thought of an old saying. Paying students is like ""drinking poison to end thirst""-- trying to solve a problem without thinking of the bad effects. Dinh Minh Tuan from Vietnamsays rewards are important because they prepare students for the future life. But young children should get things they value more than money, like funny books, pens and film tickets. There was a suggestion from South Korea that if rewards are necessary for learning,they could be gathered like a charity fund. This money could be used for a project designed by the students. Francisco Mora from Colombiasays the city ofBogotapays parents, so children do not have to work until they finish their basic education. This, he says, has increased the number of students who come to public schools. Teresa Finamore wrote: ""I am an Italian teacher of math and science for students from eleven to fourteen. I think that it is wrong to pay students. Each student has to understand that going to school, he gets a wonderful chance to live better in the future and also at present."" Nelly Constant in France wonders, if young people get paid for studying, what will they expect from a job --a rocket to the moon? Sergio Fernandes from Brazilsays paying students is not realistic. But Camillus Chiemela, a Nigerian living inGermany, feels it will help to make the education system better. Students' expectations will be much higher. Naval from Russiaalso says yes to the idea: ""We should at least get something for our time wasted. Because in my country students pay money to go to school or get good grades from teachers."" And Lucy Ding from Chinasays most Chinese students work hard for two reasons: their parents' expectations and pressure from teachers. She says getting rewards will become a good thing that will get students to work hard for themselves, for the things they hope to get."	['Camillus Chiemela']

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	Huckleberry Finn,the great character from the Mark Twain book,did not like school.He preferred floating down the Mississippi River on a raft and looking for adventure.That's why generations of schoolboys have loved reading Huckleberry Finn:they feel the same way about[ school as he did. For many boys,being forced to sit all day in a school room is like being punished for a crime they did not commit.There are endless hours of boredom spent learning things they have no interest in.That's why many boys do poorly in school and many give up on education altogether. Ironically ,the whole idea for schools was invented for boys.If a boy wanted to grow up to be a useful man,he had to be educated.By and by,people realized that educating girls was a good idea,too.And,ironically again,it was discovered that the school system suits girls just fine;so fine that girls now do much better than boys in school. No one really knows why that is.Some say that girls mature quicker than boys and adapt better to school life.Some also say that the school system and the curriculum have changed to encourage girls but _ . Educators are now trying to find ways to get boys to be more successful in school.There are suggestions to separate the sexes and teach boys separately.There are also suggestions to change[ the curriculum to make it more interesting for boys. Whatever the changes are,boys still will be boys,and dreams of floating down the Mississippi River will always be an attractive choice to just sitting in a classroom.

Which word best describes the author's attitude toward walking?	"One important attraction of walking is its long-lasting appeal. Whereas jogging and aerobic dancing can _ quickly, walking provides a popular activity that seems to endure. Fitness foundations estimate that 35 million adult Americans walk for exercise every day, with at least 15 million walking two or three times a week. Among the most regular walkers are those 65 years and older--evidence that walking is an exercise that lasts. In addition to its many physical benefits, walking, like other physical activities, has a comforting effect on the psyche. Walking can help you to think more clearly and feel more relaxed. It also can be a sociable activity. An early morning walk around the neighborhood provides an opportunity to chat with friends or simply admire the flowers. Or because it does not require a team or even a partner, walking is something you can do on your own time, by yourself, whenever the mood strikes. Easily affordable, all you need to start walking is enthusiasm and a pair of comfortable and sturdy low-heeled shoes. Dr.ChristineL. Wells recommends an Oxford-style shoe with ties for better foot support; she does not recommend sneakers or other ""cheapies"". If you plan to walk regularly, you might want to invest in a pair of so-called walking shoes. If so, expect to spend at least $35. For walking during the hotter months, early morning or evening hours are best. Clothes should fit loosely and be lightweight and light-colored. Elderly walkers should consider wearing long sleeves, and all Arizonans need to be particularly concerned about skin cancer. Dr. Wells suggests wearing sunscreen as well as a side-brimmed hat to protect your eyes, ears, nose and back of the neck. Walkers also should drink an adequate amount of water. Wells advises drinking an 8-ounce glass of water before you start out, and more when you return. ""If you walk four miles or more a day in Arizona, I also recommend that you carry a water bottle,"" she says. "" And water is just fine; you don't need those fluid-replacement or electrolyte drinks."""	['positive']
The four bulls went their own way because _ .	Once there lived a lion in the big mountain.He was very big and strong.He often ate the other animals.Every day he went out to look for food.The small animals in the mountain were all afraid of him.Near the mountain there were four bulls .They are friends, and they often worked and played together.The tiger tried many times to catch them, but he could not do so.Every time he came near, the four bulls stood together to fight him.So he could do nothing to them. One day, the four bulls had a quarrel .After that each of them went his own way.When the lion saw this, he was happy.He caught one bull and ate him up .Then he caught another.One by one he caught all the four bulls and ate them up.

What is the passage mainly about?	"The best and worst part about being a twenty-something is that every decision you make can change the rest of your life. Once you're in your 30's or 40's, it gets harder and harder to reinvent yourself. So I made an interview with Dr. Meg Jay, the clinical psychologist. He explains why the twenties matter, and how to make the most of them. In Dr. Meg Jay's opinion, our 20s are the _ decade of adulthood. 80% of life's most important moments take place by about age 35. And 2/3 of lifetime wage growth happens during the first ten years of a career. More than half of Americans are married or are dating or living with their future partner by age 30. Personality can change more during our 20s than at any other decade in life. Female fertility peaks at 28. The brain caps off its last major growth. When it comes to adult development, 30 is not the new 20. Even if you do nothing, not making choices is a choice all the same. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do. On the other hand, I also ask him how the 20s track their progress toward their future goals and whether milestones like 21 and 30 are really important. Dr. Meg Jay think it ly important. Milestones--21, 25, 30, New Year's, birthdays, reunions--are important because they cause self-reflection. What he mentioned are as follows: Am I where I wanted to be by this age? Did I do what I said I would do this year? If not, why not. And if not now, when? A 20-year-old girl who interviewed me recently told me about a question she was advised to ask herself as she moved through adulthood: ""If you keep living your life exactly as it is, where will you be in 3 years?"" If you don't like the answer, now is the time to change course. Surely the 20s are for experimenting, but not just with philosophies and vacations and substances . The 20s are your best chance to experiment with jobs and relationships. Then each move can be more intentional and more informed than the last."

Another student told Bob that _ .	"Bob was happy. He was at a new school, and the other students were friendly. ""Hi, Bob!"" They said. But some students said, ""Hi, Peter!"" Bob didn't understand. He asked another student, "" Why do some students call me Peter?"" ""Oh, that is easy to answer,"" the student said. ""Peter was a student here last year. Now, he goes to a different school. You like Peter. Some students think that you are Peter."" Bob wanted to meet Peter. He got Peter's address from a student and went to Peter's house. Peter opened the door. Bob couldn't believe his eyes. He looked really like Peter! Bob and Peter had the same color eyes and the same smile. They had the same black hair. They also had the same birthday. Bob and Peter found out that they were twin brothers. They both were adopted by two different families. Soon after the boys born, one family adopted Bob, and another family adopted Peter. Bob's family never knew about Peter, and Peter's family never knew about Bob, either."	['he looked liked Peter']
What do Rakesh Shah and Rajiv Patel have in common?	"Parents have widely different views on the problem of pocket money. Four new fathers were asked this question and this is how they answered. Ashish Khanna: Although many argue that pocket money helps develop children's sense of value, I don't agree. I wouldn't give my child any pocket money. First of all, I never got pocket money and I seem to have a good value for money. If my child ever needed something and I felt it was a reasonable request, I would buy it for him. Sharad Sanghi: No, I wouldn't give my child pocket money because I don't want to create the perception of ""her"" money and ""my"" money. Besides, if I refuse to buy her something that I think is bad for her, she may buy it with her pocket money _ In this way, I would lose control over my child's requests. I feel it also encourages children to care more about money than anything else. I don't want my child to start judging other children by the amount of money or pocket money they have. Rakesh Shah: Yes, I would give my child pocket money because I feel that children should learn to spend money properly. I will give him a fixed amount every month and if he spends the money before the month is over, he will learn a lesson and not spend money so freely. He will learn what his limitations are and feel the difficulty when he has to pay for something that is over his own pocket. Rajiv Patel: Yes, I would give my child pocket money because it is important that he learns to manage money. But I would not give it to him on a weekly or monthly basis. He would have to earn it. If he helped me finish some of my jobs or helped his mother with housework, I would reward him. This helps him realize that ""money does not grow on trees"" and it requires hard work to earn money."

The best title for the passage would probably be _ .	"Long queues at cinemas buying hot tickets for blockbusters will become rare as Beijing residents will be able to order film tickets via cell phone networks in a month. Film ticket circulation service on cell phone, also called the ""Green channel of film tickets ordering"", is aiming at lowing the cost of ticket circulation and easing the ticket distribution pressure on such popular film-watching days as summer and winter vacations or Valentine's Day. ""People log onto the net through cell phones, then choose cinema seats, _ , browse information for new films and read cinema introductions,"" said Guan Zheng, the publicity chief of Xingmei Digital Media Company Ltd., the service provider. ""Film fans can enjoy various discount prices if they order tickets via cell phones,"" Guan said. Meanwhile, the cell phone ticket circulation platform provides subscribers general mobile phone services like jokes, videos, flashes, phone ring downloads and games. The service is about to be put into trial at the Beijing-based Xingmei International Cinema for a month before being putting into use at other cinema chains both in and outside Beijing, as the service is going to be improved through gradual expansion, said Guan. China's film industry that is being restored has seen more and more enthusiastic moviegoers. Up to the end of 2009, China has had more than 5,000 specialized cinemas, among which there are 2,243 modern cinemas with 3, 668 silver screens and 56 cinema chains. Currently, many people buy film tickets on the Internet or by phoning the cinema's ticket office or simply queuing at the cinema gate. More people want to buy tickets on popular days like May Day holiday, National Day holiday or Valentine's Day. Yet the inefficient ticket circulation system contributes the most to the failure."

When he was a small boy, books about the sea had made Sanders want to be _ .	"As a boy, Sanders was much influenced by books about the sea, but by the age of fifteen he had decided to become a doctor rather than a sailor. His father was a doctor. So he was often with the doctors and got along very well with them. When he was fourteen, he was already hanging around the hospital where he was supposed to be helping to clean the medicine bottles, but was actually trying to listen to the doctors' conversations with patients in the next room. During the war Sanders served in the army as a surgeon . ""That was the happiest time of my life. I was dealing with real sufferers and on the whole making a success of my job."" In Rhodes he taught the country people simple facts about medicine. He saw himself as a life-saver. He had proved his skill to himself and had a firm belief that he could serve those who lived simply, and were dependent upon him. Thus, while in a position to tell them what to do he could feel he was serving them. After the war, he married and set up a practice deep in the English countryside, working under an old doctor who hated the sight of blood. This gave the younger man plenty of opportunity to go on working as a life-saver."	['a sailor']
What can we conclude according to the researchers?	"The works of Shakespeare and Wordsworth are ""rocket-boosters"" to the brain and better therapy than self-help books, researchers will say this week. Scientists, psychologists and English academics at Liverpool University have found that reading the works of the Bard and other classical writers has a beneficial effect on the mind, catches the reader's attention and cause moments of self-reflection. Using scanners, they monitored the brain activity of volunteers as they read works by William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, T.S Eliot and others. They then ""translated"" the texts into more ""straightforward"", modern language and again monitored the readers' brains as they read the words. Scans showed that the more ""challenging"" prose and poetry set off far more electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as it responded to each word and record how it ""lit up"" as the readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or difficult sentence structure. This ""lighting up"" of the mind lasts longer than the initial electrical spark, shifting the brain to a higher gear, encouraging further reading. The research also found that reading poetry, in particular, increases activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, an area concerned with ""autobiographical memory"", helping the reader to reflect on and reappraise their own experiences in light of what they have read. The academics said this meant the classics were more useful than self-help books. Philip Davis, an English professor who has worked on the study with the university's magnetic resonance centre, will tell a conference this week: ""Serious literature acts like a rocket-booster to the brain. ""The research shows the power of literature to shift mental pathways, to create new thoughts, shapes and connections in the young and the elderly alike."""	['The right hemisphere of the brain is related to autobiographical memory.']
The author glanced at the cashier because of _ .	"One day I was waiting in line to check out at Wal-Mart. Like a lot of people who want to get through a checkout line, my thoughts were on speed, nothing more. The line I was standing in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted, and I glanced toward the cashier. There stood a man in his seventies. Of average build, he wore glasses and a nice smile. I thought, ""Well, he's an old guy and it probably takes him a little longer to get the chores done."" For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before he began scanning the items they were purchasing. Sure, his words were the usual, ""How's it going?"" But he did something different--he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation. I thought it was strange, but I guess I had grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of a robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don't give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, ""I just found out I have six months to live,'' and someone would reply, ""Have a great day!'' This old cashier had my attention. He seemed genuine about wanting to know how people were feeling. And after giving them the change, the old cashier looked the customers in the eyes. ""I sure want to thank you for shopping here today, ''he told them. ""You will have a great day. Bye-bye."" The looks on the faces of the customers were priceless. There were smiles and some shy grins .All had been touched by his simple gesture in a place they never expected."	['the slow speed of the checkout line']
According to Diener, a person can be judged to be happy when he _ .	"Happiness pays off, studies show. Psychologists seeking the real secrets of happiness report that very happy people tend to be more _ and agreeable than less happy people. ""Our findings suggest that very happy people have rich and satisfying social relationships and spend little time alone compared to average people,"" write psychologists Ed Diener and Martin E. P. Seligman in the journal Psychological Science. Solid social relationships do not promise happiness, but they are an important contributing factor. The very happy people whom the authors studied all said they had good quality social relationships. However, the authors write, there is no single key to high happiness. ""High happiness seems to be like beautiful symphonic music--including many instruments, without any one being enough for the beautiful quality."" Diener regards happiness as ""subjective wellbeing""--in other words, the person evaluates his or her own quality of life. The question to ask is, ""Is my life going well, according to the standards I choose to use?"" If the answer is ""yes"", then that person is judged to be happy. Because people evaluate their lives based on happiness, subjective wellbeing is very important. Though necessary, it is not enough for having a good life. ""Subjective wellbeing seems quite necessary for the 'good society', although it is not enough for that society because there are other things we also value and would want in such a place."" says Diener. Can subjective wellbeing be measured scientificall? Diener points out three parts contributing to happiness: pleasant emotions and moods, lack of negative emotions and moods, and satisfaction judgment, to which other factors including cheerfulness and feelings of fulfillment may be added. There is no magic formula for happiness. Diener suggests steps you can take to ensure you are as happy as you can be. Surrounding yourself with good friends and family--people who care about you and whom you care about--is a start. Joining in activities you enjoy and value is also important; whether it's work or play, keeping busy in an environment enjoyable to you will contribute much to your subjective wellbeing. In addition, a healthy outlook is necessary."	['thinks his life is going well according to his own standards']
Why is it harder to apply for Hong Kong's schools?	Ryo Desmidt is in his first year at a kindergarten in Hong Kong and seems like an especially gifted child.He is three years old.Since he was ten months old,his mother,Momoe,has been taking him to a language center five times a week where he is taught to listen, speak and interact in English, Mandarin and Japanese.He attends a language school in the city that offers courses for children as young as a few months old. Some parents will even pay a tutor to speak in a particular language for an hour in the belief their baby will absorb this.This is just one of the many examples of how parents in Hong Kong are trying to get ahead of the game by giving their children a competitive edge in the race for limited school places. With a large expatriate community and an increase in mainland Chinese parents wishing to send their kids across the homer to school.Hong Kong's world class educational system is undere siege with applications.And this pressure is being felt by parents,many of whom are starting early and going to extraordinary lengths to outshine thousands of other applicants for limited pre--school opportunities,believing it will give them an advantage when it comes to securing a primary school place. At this time of the year,parents go into a crazy queuing for application forms at schools acroos Hong Kong.According to Fung Kai Kindergarten in the city's Sheung Shui district,around 2,000 people camped out overnight to apply for only 240 available spaces on October 7--police were even called in to deal with complaints about people cutting the queue.

She and seven other non-Chinese winners were chosen from a pool of 262 applicants from 47 countries in a contest organized by Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group and the official English-language newspaper, China Daily.

What is this passage mainly about?	I was sleeping in my room when my bed started shaking and a loud noise was heard. I woke up and my mom was screaming my name. Next moment I was running along with my younger sister, mom and dad. Before I ran out of the door, I realized my elder sister hadn't come out yet. So I screamed her name at the top of my voice. My mom said she had gone to her class. Then the four of us, along with many others, were running on the staircase. We lived on the seventh floor, so I thought we would not be able to make it and the building would fall before we managed to reach even the fourth floor. My dad's head was injured by something falling down. I did try to put my hand over his head. When we reached the sixth floor, the building split into two. We had no way to get down. The next thing I remember is silence. There were around 30 people on the staircase and none could react. Five minutes later, someone opened the door of the sixth-floor flat. We all went in. we were wondering how we would get down. From the balcony of the sixth-floor flat, I saw people standing on the ground floor. All eyes were stuck on us. I could see my elder sister crying. Our first hope of surviving came when a worker climbed a rope to where we were. That was ,the first time we thought maybe we could get down. Half an hour passed and we were still trapped. Finally RSS people arrived with ropes. They got people down one by one. My biggest worry was how my dad would get down. Finally after two and a half hours, we all got down. That day we saw the power of nature. It has taken more than two years to build the flats and it took just one and a half minutes to destroy the structure.	"[""The writer's experience in an earthquake""]"
What would be the best title ?	"Facial expressions carry meaning that is determined by situations and relationships. For example, in American culture the smile is in general an expression of pleasure. Yet it also has other uses. A woman's smile at a police officer does not carry the same meaning as the smile she gives to a young child. A smile may show love or politeness. It can also hide true feelings. It often causes confusion across cultures. For example, many people in Russia smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even improper. Yet many Americans smile freely at strangers in public places (although this is less common in big cities). Some Russians believe that Americans smile in the wrong places; some Americans believe that Russians don't smile enough. In Southeast Asian culture, a smile is frequently used to cover painful feelings. Vietnamese people may tell a sad story but end the story with a smile. Our faces show emotions, but we should not attempt to ""read"" people from another culture as we would ""read"" someone from our own culture. The fact that members of one culture do not express their emotions as openly as do members of another does not mean that they do not experience emotions. Rather, there are cultural differences in the amount of facial expressions permitted. For example, in public and in formal situations many Japanese do not show their emotions as freely as Americans do. When with friends, Japanese and Americans seem to show their emotions similarly. It is difficult to generalize about Americans and facial expressiveness because of personal and cultural differences in the United States. People from certain cultural backgrounds in the United States seem to be more facially expressive than others. The key is to try not to judge people whose ways of showing emotion are different. If we judge according to our own cultural habits, we may make the mistake of ""reading"" the other person incorrectly."	['Facial Expressiveness']
By giving us the two examples, the writer means to show us that _ .	Traveling to every part of the world gets easier, but how well do we know and understand each other. Here's a simple test. Imagine you are planning to hold a meeting at four o'clock. What time should you expect your foreign business friends to arrive? If they are Germans, they'll arrive on time. If they are Americans, they'll probably be 15 minutes early. If they are Englishmen, they'll be 15 minutes late, and you should allow up to an hour for the Italians. The British seemed to think since the English language was widely used in the world, people would always understand what they do. However, they found they were completely wrong. For example, the British are happy to have a business lunch and discuss business matters and have a drink during the meal. The Japanese prefer not to work while eating. Lunch is a time for them to relax and get to know each other and they don't drink at lunchtime. The Germans like to talk business before dinner. The French like to eat first and talk afterwards. They have to be well fed and watered before they discuss anything.	['different countries have different cultures in different parts of the world']
The writer thought their forefathers _ .	We Americans are wasteful people, not used to saving. Early settlers, our forefathers set us an example of wasting everything, for they thought nature's resources were so plentiful that none of them ever imagined that natural materials would be used up in time. Within a few years of the first Virginia settlement, for example, pioneers burned down their houses when they were ready to move west. They burned down their houses with only one aim to get the nails for future use. No one ever gave a thought to the priceless hardwoods that went up in smoke. As a people we destroy many valuable things that other people save. I noticed this when I was living in Britain. I received a letter from one England's largest banks. It was enclosed in a used envelope that had been readdressed to me. Such a practice would be unthinkable in the United States. American banks, even the smallest, always use expensive stationery with the names of all twenty - eight vice - presidents lists on side of the page.	['wasted many natural resources']
Which of the following places could be most suitable for the winter sports lovers?	"World's Best Places to Visit We hope the following places can help you choose where to go on your next vacation. Zurich From swimming in Lake Zurich in summer to skiing the Alps in winter, Zurich attracts visitors year-round. As a fairytale city, Zurich is set on the banks of both a river and a lake, with the snow-topped Swiss Alps rising in the background. Clean cobblestone streets hug a hilly land and medieval church tops reach heavenward. Despite its reputation for being the center of old-school international banking and a capital for chocolate, Zurich is also a very modern city that chooses to enjoy life at an unhurried pace. Travelers desiring a real experience should strive to do the same. The City of Angels The City of Angels, the Entertainment Capital of the World--Los Angeles needs no introduction. But its notoriety both helps and hurts its reputation. The traffic on the ""101"" will tire you out just as much as an evening at a lively West Hollywood club. And your dislike at the thick smog over the city will ruin your enjoyment of a sunset overlooking Santa Monica Beach. To appreciate Los Angeles, visit the area more than once and get advice from locals. Prague A prosperous and busy city, Prague now attracts more tourists than ever. But its picturesque downtown veils both a dark legacy and a resilient past; in its 1,100 years, Prague has survived numerous overthrows, invasions, fires and floods. It's this reputation for survival and perseverance that has made the Czech capital so fascinating. Today, its storied churches, narrow streets, hilltop castle and statue-lined bridges create the scene of an urban fairy tale. Even the most tired traveler would have trouble resisting this city's charms. Puerto Rico Pick a vacation experience you're looking for, and Puerto Rico can help. Puerto Rico is an old town with a lot of historic architecture and cobblestone streets. Look no further than Old San Juan and its El Morro fortress.Consider the bioluminescent bays of Culebra and Vieques. Puerto Rico is a global destination with high-end shopping and exciting nightlife. Yellowstone More than 3,000 square miles of nature's finest canyons, hot springs and rocky cliffs are an easy sell for outdoors enthusiasts. Geothermic wonders like the Mammoth Hot Springs, Old Faithful and Yellowstone Lake are not to be missed at this national park. With dramatic peaks and lakes, Yellowstone is an outdoor enthusiast's paradise. Multicolor1ed pools go around hot springs; green forests weave past wide meadows; and hot springs launch streams of steaming water toward the sky. With so much unspoiled natural beauty, there's no doubt that the park is indeed extraordinary. While you go across the park's 3,000-plus square miles of mountains, canyons, and waterfalls, be prepared to share the trails with permanent residents like buffalo, elk and sometimes even grizzlies."

Which of the following statements is Not true according to the passage?	"US researchers have found traces of an ancient lake on Mars recently, increasing hopes of discovering evidence that billions of years ago the Red planet hosted life. The lake, which dates back some 3.4 billion years, appears to have covered as much as 80 square miles and was up to 1,500 feet deep, said the team from the University of Colorado. ""This is the first clear evidence of shorelines on the surface of Mars,"" said Boulder's research associate, Gaetano Di Achille, in a study published in the latest edition of Geophysical Research Letters. ""The identification of the shorelines and accompanying geological evidence allows us to calculate the size and volume of the lake, which appears to have formed about 3.4 billion years ago.""[:] Analysis of the images has shown the water carved out the canyon in which it was found, which then opened out into a valley depositing sediment which formed a delta . ""Finding shorelines is a great discovery to us,"" said assistant professor Brian Hynek, adding it showed the lake existed at a time when Mars was thought to have been cold and dry. Scientists believe the oldest surfaces on Mars formed during the wet and warm era known as the Noachan epoch, about 4.1 billion to 3.7 billion years ago. The newly discovered lake is believed to date from the Hesperian era and postdates the end of the warm and wet period on Mars by 300 million years, according to the study. Scientists believe deltas next to the lake may well hold secrets about past life on Mars as such places on Earth have become the natural deposits of organic carbon and other markers of life."

60. The writer wants us to understand that a child _ .	Play is the basic business of childhood, and more and more in recent years research has shown the great importance of play in the development of a human being.From earliest infancy , every child needs opportunity and the right material for play, and the main tools of play are toys.The main function of toys is to suggest, encourage and assist play.To succeed in this, they must be good toys, which children will play with often, and will come back to again and again.Therefore, it is important to choose suitable toys for different stages of a child's development. In recent years research on infant development has shown that the standard a child is likely to reach, within the range of his inherited abilities, is largely determined in the first three years of his life.So a baby's ability to benefit from the right play materials should not be underestimated.A baby who is encouraged, talked to and shown things and played with, has the best chance of growing up successfully. The next stage, from three to five years old, curiosity knows no bounds.Every type of suitable toy should be made available to the child, for trying out, experimenting and learning, for discovering his own particular ability. Bricks and jigsaws and construction toys; painting, scribbling and making things; sand and water play; toys for imaginative and pretending play; the first social games for learning to play and get on with others. By the third stage of play development--from five to seven or eight years old-- the child is at school.But for a few more years play is still the best way of learning, at home or at school.It is easier to see which type of toys the child most enjoys. Until the age of seven or eight, play and work mean much the same to a child.But once reading has been mastered, then books and school become the main source of learning.Toys are still interesting and valuable, which lead up to new hobbies, but their significance has changed --to a child of nine or ten years old, toys and games mean, as to adults, relaxation and fun.

why did't Tanis go to college after high school?	Dear Alfred, I want to tell you how important your help is to my life. Growing up, I had people telling me I was too slow, though, with an IQ of 150 at 17, I'm anything but stupid. The fact was that I was found to have ADIID . Anxious all the time, I was unable to keep focused for more than an hour at a time. However, when something did interest me, I could become absorbed. In high school, I became curious about the computer, and built my first website. Moreover, I completed the senior course of Computer Basics, plus five relevant pre-college courses. While I was exploring my curiosity, my disease got worse. I wanted to go to college after high school, but couldn't . So, I was killing my time at home until June 2012 when I discovered the online computer courses of your training center. Since then, I have taken courses like Data Science and Advanced Mathematics. Currently, I'm learning your Probability course. I have hundreds of printer paper, covered in self-written notes from your video. This has given me a purpose. Last year, I spent all my time looking for a job where, without dealing with the public , I could work alone, but still have a team to talk to. Luckily, I discovered the job--Data Analyst--this month and have been going full steam ahead. I want to prove that I can teach myself a respectful profession, without going to college, and be just as good as, if not better than, my competitors. Thank you. You've given me hope that I can follow my heart. For the first time, I feel good about myself because I'm doing something, not because someone told me I was doing good. I feel whole. This is why you're saving my life. Yours, Tanis	['She had more difficulty keeping foucesed']
Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	Bali is a tiny island that is part of Indonesia today. It is a pretty island that has many mountains and a pleasant climate. For a long time, Bali was cut off from much of the world. The people of Bali were happy and had a peaceful life. They were not allowed to fight. At one time there had been terrible wars on Bali. Then the people decided it was wrong to fight or have wars. They made rules to keep apart those people who wanted to fight. Bali was divided into seven small kingdoms. The land around each kingdom was kept empty, and no one lived there. Since the kingdoms did not share the same borders , the people could not fight about them. On Bali, even children were not allowed to fight. If two children started a fight over a toy, someone separated them. When two boys argued, they would agree not to speak to each other. Sometimes they did not talk together for months; this gave the boys a chance to forget their anger. Families who were angry with each other also promised not to speak. Their promise was written down, and the whole village knew about it. If they broke their promise, they had to offer gifts to their gods.

After reading the passage we know _ .	"China Earthquake Leaves 5,000 Homeless Beijing--An earthquake measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale left 5,000 people homeless, killed at least one person and injured 39 others in southwest China on Thursday, with more accidents expected. By late Thursday, 4,900 people were declared homeless after the quake destroyed their homes in a mountainous area lying on the border between Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. The dawn quake left one dead and 39 injured, destroyed 268 houses and damaged 1,132 other buildings so seriously that they were considered uninhabitable . Another 2,400 houses suffered less serious damage. The center of the earthquake was near the scenic Lugu Lake, a tourist place, where the local school was badly damaged. In the beginning people thought that the economic losses would add up to about 180 million yuan (22 million dollars). Governments in Yanyuan and the neighboring Yunnan country of Ninglang have joined forces in the rescue efforts and tents, clothes and medicine are badly in need of for the earthquake victims. The mountainous place, heavy rain and several aftershocks all prevented rescue efforts on Thursday. The rain could cause more badly damaged homes to fall down. More dead and injured are expected"" as rescuers have yet to reach many faraway areas"". It is very hard for rescue workers because most houses are scattered around the mountains, which are inhabited by Yi and other ethnic minority groups .

Which of the statements is possibly supported by Dr. Anthony Fauci?	"WASHINGTON -- Patients with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, often develop vitamin deficiencies . A new study has found that giving these patients a multivitamin with a mineral supplement helps to fight the disease and slows the disease's progression. Sub-Saharan Africa has always been the center of the AIDS. In Botswana, despite aggressive prevention campaigns, one out of every four adults is infected with HIV. Professor Marianna Baum based her latest research there. Baum recruited almost 900 newly infected adults who had not yet received the anti-AIDS drugs that target the virus. These adults were then divided into groups that randomly received different combinations of vitamins B, C and E, the mineral selenium or a placebo . Most patients with HIV become deficient in these vitamins, which help improve immunity . Baum said she initially thought the multivitamins alone or selenium alone would be effective in strengthening the immune system, but found that incorrect. ""We were surprised to find that only the combination was effective,"" said Baum. Research shows that when people with HIV receive anti-retroviral drugs shortly after infection, they can remain healthy and are less likely to pass the virus to others. For many countries, however, the cost of these anti-AIDS drugs is still prohibitive. Baum said the vitamin and mineral combination treatment should help low income countries better control the virus. ""A simple multivitamin supplementation with selenium provided early in HIV disease can actually slow the HIV disease progression and it is safe. It is low cost and it should be provided very early in HIV infection,"" said Baum. Baum said the supplements are not meant to replace anti-retroviral therapy, but can help those who cannot obtain the drugs. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a world famous expert on AIDS, disagrees. ""I haven't read the paper, but having taken care of HIV-infected individuals for three decades, I would doubt that vitamins are going to have a major effect on stopping the virus,"" said Fauci. Fauci said vitamin and mineral supplements may make a patient generally healthier, but the only thing that truly works to stop HIV is anti-retroviral treatment. Baum's study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association."	['Anti-retroviral treatment is effective to stop HIV.']
Steve gave up the online search for his birth mother in 2003 because _ .	"Steve knew he'd been adopted as a baby, and when he turned 18, in 2003, he decided he'd try to track down his birth mother. The agency from which he'd been adopted gave him his mother's name: Tallady. But online searches didn't turn up any results about it, and Steve had to let it go. In 2007, though, he searched for the name again online. This time, the search results included a home address near the Lowe's store where Steve, then 22, worked as a deliveryman. When he mentioned the coincidence to his boss, his boss said, ""You mean Tallady, who works here?"" Steve and Tallady, a cashier, had said hello to each other a few times at the store, but they'd never really talked. He hadn't even known her name. Steve thought there was no possible way she was his mother though they shared the same name. For a few months, Steve avoided Tallady. ""I wasn't sure how to approach her,"" he told a local reporter. Finally, the agency volunteered to arrange their reunion. When Tallady realized that the nice guy she'd been waving at was his son, she sobbed. She'd always hoped to meet her birth son one day. Later that day, mother and son talked for almost three hours at a nearby bar. She'd given him up for adoption in 1985, when she was 23. ""I wasn't ready to be a mother,"" she told him.

What kind of dogs are likely to suffer from nasal cancer?	"Secondhand smoke isn't just a health threat to people.It can also hurt dogs and cats,veterinarians say. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,more than 126 million Americans who don't smoke are exposed to secondhand smoke in their homes,vehicles,workplaces,and public places.This exposure causes thousands of lung cancer and heart disease deaths among nonsmokers every year,according to the California Environmental Protection Agency. ""Making the leap from the effects of secondhand smoke on humans to their effects on pets isn't a big one,"" says veterinarian Carolynn MacAllister of Oklahoma State University. ""There have been a number of scientific papers recently that have reported the significant health threat secondhand smoke poses to pets,"" MacAllister said.""Secondhand smoke has been associated with oral cancer and lymphoma in cats,lung and nasal cancer in dogs,as well as lung cancer in birds."" Studies have also shown that dogs living in a smoking household are susceptible to cancers of the nose and sinus area,particularly if they are a long-nosed breed,because their noses have a greater surface area that is exposed to carcinogens and a greater area for them to accumulate.Dogs affected with nasal cancer normally don't survive for more than one year. ""Short and medium-nosed dogs are more susceptible to lung cancer,because their shorter nasal passage aren't as effective at accumulating the inhaled secondhand smoke carcinogens,"" MacAllister said.""This results in more carcinogens reaching the lungs."" Birds are also at risk for lung cancer,as well as pneumonia,because their respiratory systems are hypersensitive to any type of air pollutant. To help prevent animals from being adversely affected by smoking,pet owners who smoke should have a designated smoking area that is separated from the home or stop smoking altogether,MacAllister said."

What more measures will probably be taken about food' safety?	"Each year, bad food sickens about one in six Americans. Proposed new rules aim to improve food safety. Officials say the changes could prevent more than one million cases of food-related illnesses each year. The new rules were proposed this month, exactly two years after President Obama signed the Food Safety Modernization Act. The rules are the first step in putting the law into effect, making the biggest changes in food safety since the 1930s. The law makes the Food and Drug Administration responsible for preventing food-related illnesses. Experts say this is a change from the role that the FDA has played in the past in reacting to disease outbreaks . Congress passed the law after a series of outbreaks linked to bagged spinach, peanut butter and other foods. Margaret Hamburg is commissioner of the FDA. ""They occurred because of problems that would have been solved by these kinds of approaches. So I think, you know>> we're very optimistic that we will begin to see the real change. "" The agency is proposing to require food manufacturers to show that they have identified where contamination is most likely to happen. Manufacturers would also have to show that they have taken steps to prevent it. The proposed rules also deal with safety in growing and harvesting fruits and vegetables. Caroline Smith DeWaal is director for food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. She says the rules should have been released a year ago. And she notes, ""The bigger question is, where are the rules on imports that haven't been released yet?"" The FDA says about 15 percent of food eaten by Americans is imported, and that share is growing. Rules have not been released yet to require imported foods to meet the same standards as food produced in the United States."	['To make rules to ensure the safety of imported food.']
"The rule of the game of language is probably "" _ ""."	"""How are you?"" is a nice question. It's a friendly way that people in the USA greet each other. But ""How are you"" is also a very unusual question. It's a question that often doesn't need an answer. The person who asks ""How are you?"" hopes to hear the answer "" Fine"", even if the person's friend isn't fine. The reason is that ""How are you?"" isn't really a question and ""Fine"" isn't really an answer. They are simply other ways of saying ""Hello"" or ""Hi"". Sometimes, people also don't say exactly what they mean. For example, when someone asks ""Do you agree?"" the other person might think, ""No, I disagree. I think you're wrong..."" But it isn't very polite to disagree so strongly, so the other person might say ""I'm not sure."" It's a nicer way to say that you don't agree with someone. People also don't say exactly what they are thinking when they finish talking with other people. For example, may talks over the phone finish when one person says ""I've to go now."" Often, the person who wants to hang up gives an excuse ""Someone's at the door."" ""Something is burning on the stove."" The excuses might be real, or not. _ The excuse is more polite, and it doesn't hurt the other person. Whether they are greeting each other, talking about an idea, or finishing a talk, people don't say exactly that they are thinking. It's an important way that people try to be nice to each other, and it's part of the rule of the game of language."	['Be polite']
Which of the following is TRUE?	"The opening of the Sherlock Holmes Museum to the public on March 27, 1990, was an event that should have happened several decades ago. Baker Street is, after all, one of the world's most famous streets because of its long association with the great detective.

You can take as many photographs as you want (the maid will be pleased to assist) and when you are ready to leave, a ride home in a horse-drawn carriage will complete your 19th century experience! Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson lived at 221b Baker Street from about 1881 to 1904. Apartment 221b was on the first floor of a lodging house, which they rented from a Mrs Hudson. The famous study that Holmes and his friend Dr Watson shared for almost 25 years is on the first floor overlooking Baker Street. We know from Doctor Watson's descriptions that their sitting room overlooking Baker Street was ""illuminated(, ) by two broad windows"" and that it was quite small. Doctor Watson's bedroom was on the second floor next to Mrs Hudson's room and it overlooked an open yard at the back of the house. These rooms are used today for exhibits, where center stage is taken by a magnificant bronze bust of Mr Holmes. Visitors can browse through literature, paintings, photographs and newspapers of the period. Memorabilia from the adventures and a selection of letters written to and from Mr Holmes are also on display. The museum's large and attractive souvenir shop is located on the ground floor.

What can be the best title for the passage?	"Americans plan parties for many reasons. As in other cultures, many Americans attend parties for weddings and religious or national holidays. But some parties are especially American. For example, a group of neighbors may gather on their street to eat food, play music and visit with one another. This is called a block party. A woman might invite a group of women to a party called a baby shower for a friend who is about to give birth. Guests bring presents for the new baby. Americans also attend tailgate parties. A tailgate is the back end of a truck or other vehicle that opens down. The tailgate parties are a big part of sports culture in the United States. Friends bring food and drink to a sports event. They eat together in the parking area of the sports stadium. Birthday parties are also very popular. Many parents organize a party for their child around a theme. Birthday parties usually include gifts and a birthday cake with candles. In many parts of the United States, cupcakes have become a popular replacement for cakes. Birthday parties can be low cost or very costly. Some parents take their children's birthday parties very seriously, even when the child is too young to fully understand the celebration. One group of parents started a website called Birthdays Without Pressure. They decided that some parents were under too much social pressure to plan costly parties for their children. The group sees this movement as an example of America's culture of ""too much stuff"". The group's website gives suggestions on how to keep birthday celebrations simple, meaningful and fun without spending a lot of money. Their advice may be very helpful during this period of economic recession ."	['American parties']
What kind of feelings did the hero most probably have ?	A month went by in this manner , but a month was all I could bear . The memory of Marguerite accompanied me wherever I went . I had loved that woman --- still loved her --- too much for her suddenly to mean nothing to me . Whatever feelings I might have for her now , I had to see her again . At once . ... I knew Marguerite . Meeting me so unexpectedly must have thrown her into a state of great confusion . Probably , she had heard of my departure which had set her mind at rest as to the consequences of our sudden parting . But , seeing me back and coming face to face with me , pale as I was , she had sensed that my return had a purpose , and must have wondered what was going to happen . If , when I saw her again , Marguerite had been unhappy ; if , in taking my revenge , there had also been some way of helping her , then I might well have forgiven her , and would certainly never have dreamed of doing her any harm . But when I saw her again , she was happy , at least on the surface . Another man had ensured her the luxury in which I had been unable to keep her . She brought shame both to my pride and my love ; she was going to have to pay for what I had suffered . I could not remain indifferent to what she did now . It followed that the thing that would hurt her most would be exactly for me to show indifference . Indifference , therefore , was the feeling which I now needed to pretend , not only in her presence but in the eyes of others . I tried to put a smile on my face , and I went to call on Prudence with whom Marguerite was staying . Prudence saw me to the door , and I returned to my apartment with tears of anger in my eyes and thirst for revenge in my heart and thought only of finding a way to make the poor creature suffer .

Which of the following words can best describe the writer's mother?	When I was about twelve, I headed to a restaurant for dinner with my family. It was a windy winter night. As my mom and I headed towards the restaurant from our car, a girl about my age and her mother came up to us. They asked if we had any spare dollars. My mom immediately asked where they kept their things. They pointed to an old car in the parking across the street. The girl said there were six of them living in that car, the same size as my own family. My mom said she had something to do after handing the people a few dollars. She sent me inside the restaurant with my dad and my three siblings .But she didn't come. Later, I found out she had gone home and emptied our cupboards into a few bags. Then, she brought that food over to the car and handed the bags to the family. I wasn't there when that part happened, but I can imagine the joy it brought to their faces. A few days later, when I actually found out about what she had done, I asked her why she helped those people. She told me that they were not lucky. I remember the face of that girl who had asked us for dollars; she was the same age as me, yet our lives were so different. Here I stood, dressed in almost new clothes, headed to a restaurant and then back home to the bedroom I shared with my younger sister. I remember thinking that the girl didn't have any food to eat and that she was heading back to a cold car shared with five other people. After painting this picture in my mind, I understood my mom. I will never forget what she did that night. And that night I also learned one of the best lessons she taught.	['Kind.']
Which of the following is NOT helpful to the memory?	"Many expensive nutrition additives advertised on TV say they can improve your memory. But only ordinary food and healthy habits have been shown to work. A research team from UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) has designed a four-step plan to improve your memory in just 14 days. ""It sounds like another advertisement, but it really works,"" says UCLA psychiatry professor Gary Small. The team found the four-step plan improved memory function in teenagers under stress and older people. After a two-week study that included brain-teasers , exercise and diet changes, test subjects' memories worked more efficiently. Here's the programme: Memory training: Train yourself with brain-teasers, crossword puzzles and memory exercises that train verbal skills throughout the day. Healthy diet: Eat five rather than three meals a day. The food should be rich in omega-3 fats (omega-3), such as whole grains and vegetables that contain antioxidants . Having frequent meals helps increase blood glucose , the primary energy source for the brain. Physical fitness: Have regular physical exercise such as walking, basketball or running, every day. Stress reduction : Perform stretching and relaxation exercises. Stress causes the body to release a chemical that can shrink the memory centres in the brain. Before-and-after brain scans showed that test subjects experienced on average a 5 per cent increase in working memory. This suggests they were using their brains more efficiently. They also performed better on a cognitive test. A control group that didn't follow the plan showed no big changes. ""We've known for years that diet and exercise can help people keep their physical health, which is a key part of healthy aging,"" said Small. ""But keeping mental health is just as important. Now we have evidence that people can improve their memories through a programme of memory exercises and stress reduction."""	['Nutrition additives.']
What did the old woman think caused her health problems?	"One day, I went to see my last patient, an old woman. In the doorway, I saw she was struggling to put socks on her swollen feet in the bed. I stepped in, spoke quickly to the nurse, read her chart noting . I was almost in the clear that she was not in serious condition. I asked, ""Could I help put on your socks? How are you feeling? Your sugars and blood pressure were high but they're better today. The nurse mentioned you're anxious to see your son. He's visiting you today. It's nice to have a family visit. I think you really look forward to seeing him."" ""Sit down, doctor. This is my story, not yours."" She said with a serious voice. I was surprised as I helped her with the socks. She told me that her only son lived across from her house, but she had not seen him for five years. She believed that was the main cause of her health problems. After hearing her story and putting on her socks, I asked if there was anything else I could do for her. She shook her head no and smiled. All she wanted me to do was to listen. Each story is different. Some are detailed and others are simple. Some have a beginning, middle and end but others don't have clear ends. Some are true but others not. Yet all those things do not really matter. What matters to the storyteller is that the story is heard -- without interruption or judgment . It was that woman who taught me the importance of stopping, sitting down and truly listening. And, not long after, in an unexpected accident, I became a patient. 20 years later, I sit all the time -- in a wheelchair. For as long as I could, I continued to see patients from my chair. I believe in the power of listening."	"[""Her son's not seeing her.""]"
What is the writer's tone?	It is reported that today in China, 50% of people who write blogs do so as a personal diary and 83% use their blogs for sending messages to friends. It is also found that there is a strong East-West difference. In places like the US, blogs that offer information on news attract more readers but in China, blogs are more likely to be about sharing personal feelings. It seems that bloggers can be divided into three types: IT bloggers, bloggers who record their ordinary feelings and media bloggers. When blogging first started, the IT people had the technological advantage and they took the chance to put their thoughts on the web. Some of these IT people read their blogs. The next wave of bloggers did not have any training as writes or in IT and wrote about normal daily life. Media bloggers, however, are trained writers, such as journalists and editors. When the many media bloggers showed up, the everyday blogs lost most of their readers. Media bloggers have the advantage of knowing how to communicate well through the written word. However, the normal bloggers are still out there and increasing in number. It seems that blogging is the new way to express your feelings. People feel like the world is listening to, or rather reading, their problems, even if they are not .	['Serious and factual.']
There are _ things in the lost and found.	Mr. George works at the school lost and found. He works very carefully. Every day, when he gets a lost thing, he takes notes about it. There are pens, books, school uniforms, keys, walkmans and many other things in the lost and found. Most of them are the students'. If you lose your things, it's easy for you to go to the lost and found for help. But you must tell Mr. George what it is and its color and the day when you can't find it.

What can we learn from the story ?	"The hardworking businessman Jones used to work all day in his shop and so hard-working was he that at times he would make the sparks fly from his hammer. The son of Mr. Smith, a rich neighbor, used to come to see him every day and for hours and hours he would enjoy himself watching how the man worked. "" Young man, why don't you try your hand to learn to make shoe tacks , even if it is only to pass the time ? "" said Jones. "" Who knows, one day, it may be of use to you ."" The lazy boy began to see what he could do. But after a little practice he found that he was becoming very skilled and soon he was making some of the finest tacks. Old Mr. Smith died and the son because of the war lost all his goods. He had to leave home and was forced to live in another country. It so happened that in this village there were many shoemakers who were spending a lot of money buying tacks for their shoes and even at times when they paid high prices they were not always able to get what they wanted, because in that part of the country there was a high demand for soldiers' shoes. Our young Mr. Smith, who was finding it difficult to earn his daily bread, remembered that once upon a time he had learned the art of making tacks and had the sudden idea of making a bargain with the shoemakers. He told them that he would make the tacks if they would help to get him settled in the workshop. The shoemakers were only too glad of the offer. And after a while, Mr. Smith found that he was soon making the finest tacks in the village. "" How funny it seems, "" he used to say, "" even making tacks can make money. My trade is more useful to me than all my former riches."""	['Skill makes life easy.']
Why are more men willing to become nurses in the US?	"More men are finding their calling as nurses. A new study from the United States Census Bureau reports the number of male nurses has doubled since the l970s.Back then,about 2.7 percent of registered nurses were men.The new study,which tracked data through 2011,finds that men now make up 9.6 percent of all employed nurses in the United States about 330,000 men in total.Recent years of shortages have led to increased efforts,according to report,which included recruiting men into the field. Men,in fact,had been largely kept out of nursing in past decades because nursing schools often refused to admit men.The Supreme Court ruled that practice unconstitutional in l981 after a case involving a state nursing school. ""The ly high wages and expanding Job opportunities makes this field attractive,offering stability even during recessions ,""wrote the report's author,Liana Christin Landivar of the U.S.Census Bureau,""And because of high demand,nursing has low unemployment rates compared to other fields.'' Men were found to be more likely to become nurse anesthetists ,which is the highest paid nursing occupation,and were found least likely to become licensed practical or licensed vocational nurses,the lowest paid types of nursin9.Nurse anesthetists are required to get graduate education,and are certified to give anesthetists and monitor patients recovering from anesthesia.1Acensed practical and licensed vocational nurses provide patient care and may work under the supervision of a registered nurse.Registered nurses assess patient health problems and needs,develop and carry Out nursing care plans,maintain medical records,and administer care. For all types of nursing,men earned,on average,$60,700 per year,while women earned$51,100 per year.""Even among men and women in the same nursing occupations,men outlearn women,""wrote Landivar."

On my way in, a homeless man approached me and asked, ""Do you have any bottles lying around?"" I knew he would recycle them for a few cents, but I didn't have any, so I said no. And again he asked, ""Can you spare some change ?"" I smiled, and said no again. He was very respectful; he smiled back and said, ""OK, thank you."" Even though he didn't have anything, he was still in good spirits. From the way he spoke I could tell he was smart. Then I bought one hamburger and enjoyed my meal, but in the back of my mind I wondered whether the homeless man was hungry. After I finished my meal I decided to order another one for him. At this point I didn't know if he was still around, but I tried anyway. At the counter I ordered a hamburger and also a hot chocolate, because it was cold outside, and I thought it would help warm him up. They delivered me the hot chocolate first and as I waited for my hamburger, I noticed the homeless man was standing right beside me. I looked at him and smiled, ""This hot chocolate is for you."" He replied like a gentleman, ""Thank you so much. That's very kind of you."" I always believe no matter how _ I am, there are always those who are worse off than I. When you help someone, it's not always about money, it's about love. The love you give today, someone might forget tomorrow. It doesn't matter.

Which of the following is NOT suggested as a way to get rid of filler words?	"In December 2008, Caroline Kennedy -- daughter of the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy--sat down, as a frontrunner for the Senate seat in New York, for a televised interview that helped decide the future of her campaign. The result was a disaster. Her performance wasn't well received, in part because her speech was full of filler words--""ums,"" ""ahs"" and ""you knows."" One listener counted 27 ""ums"" and 38 ""you knows"" in the space of five minutes. A few weeks after the interview, Kennedy ended her Senate campaign. Filler words may seem natural in everyday speech, but they can be deadly in formal presentations. ""Using excessive fillers is the most annoying speech habit,"" said Susan Ward, a speech specialist. ""They take your listener's attention away often to the point that he doesn't hear anything you say. Your message is entirely lost."" Many speakers are afraid of pause. They believe their audience will think they are inarticulate if they pause to think of what to say next, so they use filler words to avoid the silence. However, a pause is actually more impressive than a filler word. Listeners know that the speaker is thinking, trying to find the right word. Sometimes a pause can actually improve a speech, as when an actor uses a dramatic pause to hold the attention of his audience. A speaker shouldn't be afraid to pause occasionally during a speech; it shows self-confidence. It takes some work to cut out filler words. You can begin by taking a few seconds to think about what you want to say the next time you are asked a question. This pause will help you begin powerfully, and it will help you avoid using a filler word. The same public speaking technique applies when you are shifting from one idea to another. While you may be tempted to fill the silence between ideas with a filler word, remember to allow yourself to pause and think about what you want to say next. If you need help overcoming your ""um"" problem, consider asking a family member or a friend to point out when you use filler words. You also could record an upcoming presentation and then watch yourself in action. You may be amazed at how often you say ""um"" or ""uh""! Although we live in a fast-paced society that seemingly demands instant answers, we must use the pause to our advantage. Finally, we should only speak when we are ready."

In the future, if you buy clothes online, you may _ .	"Imagine shopping for clothes online and being able to run your hand across the screen of your computer or smartphone to feel the materials. That kind of simulation technology could be available within the next five years. ""We're talking about reinventing how computers interact with humans,"" said Bernie Meyerson, IBM Vice President. Extending our sense of touch is one of the innovations IBM believes will change the world in the next five years, according to the company's annual ""Five in Five"" list. Smart machines will also be able to listen to the environment and highlight (;)the sounds we care about most. For instance, an advanced speech recognition system will tell new parents why their baby is crying. This kind of thing is not possible today, but with an advanced enough system, it's actually possible. In the near future, personal computers will be able to do more than recognize images and visual data. Their built-in cameras will be able to analyze features such as colors, and understand the meaning of visual media, such as knowing how to sort family photos. Smart machines will also be able to smell. If you sneeze on your computer or cellphone, tiny sensors in the machine will be able to analyze thousands of molecules in your breath. ""It can give you an alarm and says, 'Hey, you are probably sick, go to see your doctor immediately,'"" Meyerson says. Mark Maloo is a computer science professor from Georgetown University. He hopes the advances will encourage more students to study science, technology, engineering and math, preparing them to play a role in future innovations. He believes there's little doubt that advances in computer technology over the next five years will make what now seems like science fiction a part of our everyday lives."

Whom is the passage written for?	Parents often avoid talking about the issue of media and kids because we don't know what to do. But we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work helping our kids make right and wise decisions about media. There are things you can do to improve the media health of your family. Take the television for example. The television is not a babysitter. Hopefully, parents are extremely careful about choosing a babysitter and day care for their children. Why are we not as careful in choosing the TV programs our kids watch? Know what shows your kids are watching on television. It is important to know the content of every program your child watches. As a rule, most programs will either work to reinforce your values or oppose them. This is why it is so important to be aware of a program's content. Don't put a television in their bedrooms. A television in your child's bedroom is a big no-no. You won't be able to monitor the content, and our kids may be drawn to their rooms. A television in the bedroom is a far too attractive temptation for your kids. Set limits on TV time. What are your guidelines, rules, and expectations for television viewing? Setting limits may be challenging, but if you insist, the results are well worth it. Talk with your kids about TV shows. All television is educational. The question is what does it teach? Watch television with your kids, and then discuss with them the themes and content afterward. You'll be surprised just how easy it is to turn a TV program or movie into a first-rate learning experience.	['Parents.']

When I looked at the giant yellow machine, I wasn't afraid at all, But when I was really on it, I felt a little nervous. First, the machine took us to the highest point. We all screamed ""Ah"". 1 dared not look down. Then it turned around fast and moved very quickly at the same time. The wind was so strong that I couldn't open my eyes. I felt as if I would fall down. 1 couldn't stop screaming through the whole ride. It only moved for a few minutes, but it seemed to be many hours. When the game ended, I was too frightened to walk. Later we took part in the game called ""Crossing Jurassic "". After waiting for half an hour, we got into a boat. The boat went into a tall building. It was dark around us. There were many model dinosaurs on both sides. They looked like the real ones. From time to time. the model dinosaurs made some frightening shouts, which sounded terrible. The game ended with a sudden rush from a very high place into a big pool. What an exciting experience!"	['The yellow machine turned around fast and moved quickly at the same time.']
According to New Scientist magazine, more and more evidence has come to suggest that _ .	"LONDON ( Reuters)-- Ecotourism is causing a lot of damage to wildlife and may be endangering the survival of the very animals people are flocking to see, according to researchers. Biologists and conservationists are worried because polar bears, dolphins, penguins and other creatures are getting stressed and losing weight and some are dying. ""Evidence is growing that many animals do not react well to tourists in their backyard,"" New Scientist magazine said. The immediate effects researchers have noticed are changes in behavior, heart rates, or stress hormone levels but they fear it could get much worse and over the long term ""could endanger the survival of the very wildlife they want to see"". Although money produced through ecotourism, which has been growing at about 10--30 percent a year, has major benefits for poor countries and people living in rural areas, the Swiss-based World Conservation Union (IUCN) and some governments fear not all projects are audited and based on environmentally friendly policies, according to the magazine. ""The transmission of disease to wildlife, or small changes to wildlife health through disturbance of daily life or increased stress levels, while not obvious to the casual observer, may translate to lower survival and breeding,"" said Philip Seddon, of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. Scientists have noticed that bottleneck dolphins along the northeastern coast of New Zealand become nervously excited when tourist boats arrive. Similar changes in behavior have been observed in polar bears and yellow-eyed penguins in areas visited by ecotourists are producing smaller babies. Conservationists are now calling for more research into the effect of ecotourism on animals and say the industry must be developed carefully. They also want studies done before new ecotourism projects are started. ""The animals' welfare should be very important because without them there will be no ecotourism,"" said Rochelle Constantine of the University of Auckland in New Zealand."

"The year 1905 is known as Einstein's ""Year of Wonders"" because _ ."	"What will you be doing when you are 26 years old? Studying at university or working for a living? Take a look at what Albert Einstein was doing at the age of 26. 100 years ago, Einstein was working in Switzerland. His hobby was physics. Without much money or help, he wrote five papers for a physics magazine. Three of these greatly changed the study of physics and our understanding of space, time, light and matter . His most famous work is on the Theory of Relativity . Einstein was given the Nobel Prize for his discoveries. Although he also did many other things later, the years 1905 has been called Einstein's ""Year of Wonders"". It has been 100 years since then. Because of this, the UN has named 05 the World Year of Physics. Today, over fifty years after Einstein's death, a question is asked, "" Will there ever be another Einstein?"" It may take a long time. After all, Einstein was born more than 200 years after Sir Isaac Newton, another great scientist. Besides, physics is a different field now, and education is different, too. Even if you can't be the next great scientist, it is still helpful to remember some of the things that made Einstein great. He thought independently and read widely. He left with us a formula for life: If A is a success in life, then A=""X+Y+Z."" X is work, Y is play, and Z is keeping your mouth shut."	['Einstein made some very important discoveries in 1905']

The whole world has paid attention to the two elegant and beautiful first ladies who have made a difference in the relationship between China and the U.S.A. Mrs. Obama has visited the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, the Terracotta Warriors, and the pandas. She has tasted Peking Duck and experienced some other Chinese traditional culture. It is hoped that this trip to China can bring a real understanding of our eastern world to the first family of the United States. Today, the number of exchange students between China and the U.S. has reached more than 4 million every year. There are more than 11,000 people traveling to and from each side of the Pacific. If the two countries can increase the exchange in travel, language, cuisine, and cultural understanding, this will help a lot in improving the understanding between the two countries. Education was an important theme of Mrs. Obama's visit, and it is crucial to the development of Sino-US relationship. China has an ancient tradition of placing a high value on education, and the first lady herself is an outstanding example of a person who changed her own destiny through education. She took education as the key theme of her speech at Peking University, encouraging students from the two countries to learn more about and get wider experience of each other.	['the Summer Palace']
What does the story mainly tell us about Dana?	"The crowd at the airport flowed forward.

The main idea of this passage is that _ .	"My father' s response to the bank building at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York city was immediate and definite: ""You won' t catch me putting my money in there!"" he declared, ""Not in that glass box. "" Of course, my father is a gentleman of the old school, a member of the generation to whom a good deal of modern architecture is upsetting, but I believe that his negative response was not so much to the architecture as to a violation of his concept of the nature of money. In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity that could be carried, or stolen. Therefore, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to make sure of the fact, however, untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building' s design made it appear strong, the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol showed the general attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Except pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a tangible commodity has largely been replaced by credit. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable factor is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank. Just as the older bank emphasized its strength, this bank by its architecture is proud of imaginative powers."	['changes have taken place in both the appearance and the concept of banks']
Where did the story happen?	"One Saturday evening, my husband and I went to have dinner at a restaurant. As we sat there eating and sharing conversation, I watched an old woman stop and look around. I looked over at my husband and said, ""She must be lost."" I got up and caught up with her as she walked by our table and touched her lightly on the shoulder. ""Ma'am, are you having trouble finding who you are dining with?"" I asked. She said yes. She was there with her daughter. I asked if her daughter was the only person she was there with, and she replied yes. ""If you stay right here, I will find her and come back and take you to her--to save you some steps,"" I offered. She looked at me and said, ""But you don't know who I am here with."" She was right. I explained that her daughter should be easy to find, because I thought she would be the only lady sitting by herself in the whole restaurant. She agreed...but just then a young man stopped me and asked, ""Is she looking for her seat? They're sitting at a table right across from us."" I told him that she was and thanked him. I watched as they walked off together and kept my eyes on the old woman to make sure that she could see her daughter and all was well. I couldn't help but think that it must not be much different from being lost as a child. I wondered if I too would accept the help from strangers when I was as old as the lost woman."

Which of the following can be the best title for the passage?	Your kids learn a lot from their friends--things you can't teach them, no matter how much you want to. Probably the most important thing kids learn is how to have peer relationships. As a parent, you can't do this, because you and your child aren't equals. For example, when you're sitting on your family room floor and your very young child asks you to pass him the blocks, you probably hand them right over. If your child is sitting with a peer and asks the same thing, though, he might not get what he wants. To succeed, your child will need to learn strategies for getting what he wants. For example, he might simply yank the toy out of his friend's hand. If he does that, he may learn that it's not the best way of getting what he wants because it leads to fighting and time-outs. The successful child will learn that he needs to negotiate a trade, to wait patiently, or to find something else equally fun to play with. Friends also provide emotional support, something that is part of the foundation of healthy adulthood. You can't be with your child on the elementary school playground or at the high school dance. Your child's friends will be the ones to _ her, to include her in games, and later, to tell her she looks great even if her lousy prom date wanders off instead of dancing with her. Friends also help your children learn. Friends solve problems together, imitate each other, and pass on knowledge . Some experts believe that the single biggest predictor of your child's success later in life is her ability to make friends. In fact, they claim it's even more important than IQ and grades. This doesn't mean that the kids who are most popular in school do the best later on in life. What matters is not the number of friends a child has but rather the quality of the relationships. This is good news for those of us who hate to think that popularity really is the Holy Grail of childhood and adolescence. While it's true that popularity has many advantages, and that many popular kids really are nice people--and not just the best dressed or best looking--it's better to have a few good friends than to have the admiration of the masses.

The police of New York, Chicago and Detroithave a particularly rough time because _ .	"American TV and movies once gave a tough and cruel picture of the American police, though now there are TV series which have _ as heroes and defenders of society. The police are grateful for the good publicity and their new image, especially in cities where there are black Jews, who live under poverty line. White policemen are now careful of how they speak and act towards their fellow black citizens. The cop is a city or a State employee. He cannot arrest anyone outside his city or his State. He cannot even cross the border into a neighbor State in search of a criminal. If he does, he can be charged with breaking the law of that State. The police who have to be really tough are those who operate in big cities, like New York,Chicago and Detroit, which have large ghettos and organized crimes. Since the majority of criminals are armed, American cops have to use their guns more often than most policemen in other places and the car chases through the crowded streets of Manhattan, which are a favorite feature of gangster movie, are not so exaggerated . American cops get shot down, run over, stabbed, beaten up, and their wives are in constant fear that one day their men will not come home. Many policemen do a lot to help children whose parents are criminals. They understand better than most citizens the terrible misery of the Jews. They feel sorry for the drug addicts, but often treat roughly the ""pushers"" who sell the drugs--when they can catch them. They have been accused of making no serious attempt to break up the various drug rings. They say that such task would be never-ending."	['these cities have large Jews and organized crime']
"Why does the passage talk about the phrase ""fair play""?"	"Of all the famous English writers, probably the best known is William Shakespeare. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564 on April the 23rd. His father was an important man in town so Shakespeare had a good upbringing. Shakespeare probably went to school (although no records survive to prove this) but not university. He got married when he was 18 to Anne Hathaway and the couple had 3 children. Shakespeare wrote 38 plays and 154 sonnets (a sonnet is a kind of poem). He began working in his home town of Stratford but by 1592 was writing in London. He became rich enough to buy a house in the capital and one in Stratford. He wrote sad stories called tragedies, like Romeo and Juliet, funny stories or comedies, romantic stories and stories about historical figures such as Julius Caesar. Shakespeare died on his birthday in 1616, almost 400 years ago. But why is his work still popular today? His work looked at common human themes, such as betrayal, murder, lust, power, ambition and love. These themes are as much a part of human nature today as they were all those years ago and are the themes we see in modern soap operas and Hollywood films. Even though his theatre, The Globe, burned down in 1613 it was rebuilt in London in 1997 and you can still see his plays performed there today. Shakespeare's influence on the English language can still be felt today. We talk about ""fair play"", meaning honest behaviour but this phrase was first used by Shakespeare. He coined the phrase ""you can have too much of a good thing"". And it was Shakespeare who came up with the expression to disappear ""into thin air"" which we still use today when we lose something. Shakespeare's work has been translated into every major language in the world. And perhaps we'll still be as fascinated by his work 400 years from now as we've been for the last 400."

The article is mainly about _ .	"IN China, red is known to be a lucky color. But you may be surprised to know that British culture is also full of the color red. It's true: Go to Britain and you will see red everywhere. There are red postboxes on street corners and on the sides of buildings. The British red phone box is famous all over the world. The famous double-decker bus is red. Red is the color traditionally worn by British soldiers in battle , and there is red in the UK's Union Jack national flag. Britain even has a famous team of stunt jet fighters called ""The Red Arrows"". To go with British culture's love of red, British nature also features many red animals. A beloved bird is the robin , which has a bright red breast . At Christmastime in winter, the bird is commonly found on the greetings cards people send each other. There is also quite a rare animal called the red squirrel . Foxes are red, and they used to be hunted by men in red outfits . But is red considered lucky to British people? A good way to see how a culture looks at a color is to look at the way it uses it in language. The results may surprise you. Even though Britain has a lot of red on its high streets and in its countryside, red is used quite differently as a metaphor . If someone ""sees red"", they are angry. When a person is ""red faced"", they are out of breath or blushing . Red is also a political color: it means a left-winger (blue is the color of the political right). To be ""in the red"" is to be in debt (someone in credit is ""in the black""). Look hard enough and you'll find the color red being used in all countries. For instance the ""red heart"" symbol is pretty universal. But whether the British realize it or not, red is everywhere in Britain. It does seem that the country is in love with the color."

64. According to the passage when people think about holidays they care much for _ .	Think back to this time last year. What was on your mind? Most likely, you were thinking about finals or the holidays, although in this city I've noticed that thinking about the holiday is a fancy way of saying how much stuff will I get. Now reflect on your thoughts for this holiday season. Most people are still thinking about the holidays, but I say that with a grain of salt. Everybody with a functioning brain and the ability to communicate knows that this holioday season comes with a pretty large price tag: the debt of all the hardships, both domestic and foreign, that we've faced over the past 12months. Let's face it: some of us will get everything we want over the holidays. But there are others whose parents have lost their jobs or who have lost jobs themselves because of the current economic situation. As much as we try to ignore it, there is still economic unrest in the blue and gold suburb. In this situation, we have three options. One: We ignore the situation, like we seem to do for every bad thing that happens around us, because by God, it's the American Way! Two: We recognize that our economy is shot, feel bad about it and spend our time wishing for the good old days. Three: We recognize that our economy is shot, but instead of moping, reflect on every good thing that we have going for us. Now, which option sounds best to you? I spent a week this summer working in and around New York City with the city's homeless population. Or so I thought. Although a lot of the people I served were in fact homeless, a significant number of them had a job or a home or both. The truth of the importance of this situation is that they and thousands of others across the country can't afford even the most basic things of life, even while working two jobs. Yet no one that I met complained about their hardships. Instead, they took whatever I happened to give them(which was, more often than enough, not enough) and were genuinely grateful for what they had. Wrap your heads around that statement for a second. These people worked their butts off to stay alive with minimal results, yet were overjoyed by a flimsy paper plate with donated green beans on it. Although I am ashamed to admit it( both as a girthy figure and an affluent citizen), I have taken for granted most of my meals, let alone green beans, and I know for a fact that I am not alone.

Why do people in Poland have to taste all the dishes on Christmas Eve?	People in Poland tend to spend Christmas with their families, and the most important part of Christmas is Christmas Eve supper. The whole family just sits around the table, and there are twelve traditional dishes on the table, and you are supposed to taste them all, because if you don't try them all you may have bad luck in the coming year. Before everybody sits down to supper, they just break wafers with each other, wishing each ot her good luck. As soon as the supper is over, the children go to the other room, where the big Christmas tree stands and they find Christmas presents under the Christmas tree. After that, the whole family just sits around the table singing Christmas songs, and waiting for midnight to come, when they go to church.	"["".

What's the similarity between gadgets and magicians according to the passage?	"High-tech gadget shows draw throngs of excited consumers each year in the United States, Japan, Europe and the Arabian peninsula. Though many people are already surrounded with all kinds of smart electronic devices, some always need one more -- better and smarter than the previous one. At electronic shows, visitors flock around the newest tablet computers, cameras, 3D television screens, even small robots, dreaming of taking one home. Consumers spend hours waiting in lines and spend hundreds of dollars to be among the first to get the latest smart phone. The modern world seems to _ shiny expensive objects that keep us connected, help us navigate, record our thoughts and memorable events, and even talk to us. So infatuated, we no longer merely ""own"" our gadgets -- we have relationships with them, according to clinical psychologist and life transition therapist Francine Lederer. ""It's a lot easier to have, right, a one-sided relationship with your computer, your phone, than it is with a live person. So that at the end of the day, you don't need to worry about somebody being angry with you, you don't need to worry about getting blamed for anything,"" she said. Magical devices Although having a thousand Facebook friends may be perceived as equivalent to having a thousand real, authentic friendships, Lederer said in reality it is not so. ""It comes down to a lot of the internal stuff. How we feel about ourselves, our own sense of self-esteem, our self-worth, a lot of those things,"" she said. But gadgets are magical. They fascinate us the same way we are intrigued by a magician's trick, said psychology professor at the University of the South Pacific, Robert Epstein. ""If you don't know how they're doing it, that's very fascinating and intriguing. But if they do it 10 times or 20 times or 100 times, it gets boring and you want something else. That's why magicians do not repeat the same trick over and over again,"" he said. Plugged in, isolated Epstein, former editor-in-chief of Psychology Today magazine, said he is concerned that gadgets will take on a life of their own. ""All we're seeing so far is a little bit of the so-called wearable technology that you might wear on your wrist or in your glasses, but we're moving very rapidly, whether the public knows it or not, toward real biological interfaces so that the gadgets will be built into us to some extent,"" he said. Lederer said the danger is that our dependence on electronic gadgets is increasingly being perceived as normal. ""I think our society in a way, and the media, often times normalizes the extent to which we use these gadgets and phones, but the reality is, it's really not healthy for us,"" she said. Scientists predict that gadgets with biological interfaces may be available within the next 20 years and, coupled with strong artificial intelligence, will be much smarter than today."

What did the stream think when she reached a desert?	"A little stream ran down from a high mountain through many villages and forests. Then it reached a desert,""I went through so many difficulties. I should have no problem crossing the desert,""she thought. As she started, she found herself slowly disappearing into the sand. After many tries, she still failed. At this time, a deep voice said,""if a breeze can cross the desert, so can a river.""It was the voice of the desert. But the little stream answered,""that's because a breeze can fly, but I can't."" ""That's because you can't give up what you are. Let yourself evaporate into the breeze, and _ can take you across,""said the desert. ""Give up what I am now? No! No!""The little stream could not accept this idea. ""The breeze can carry the vapor across the desert and let it leave as rain. The rain will form a river again,""said the desert.""And whether you're a river or vapor, your nature never changes."" Hearing this, the little stream went into the open arms of the breeze. It carried her to the next stage of her life."	['She believed she could cross the desert.']

Arthur implies that to start a business in times of change, people have to _ .	"Burn rate is the speed at which a startup business consumes money. My rate was $ 75,000 a month. Four months after my company was set up, I had only a quarter of the starting capital left in the bank. Looking for guidance, I went to talk to my friend, Arthur Walworth about my new venture. ""Times of great change always bring out the risk-takers,"" he said. ""And they leave winners and losers. My grandfather invested a lot of money in a project of Thomas Edison's that ended up in failure. "" I was lost in thought at the notion (an idea or belief about something) of a Thomas Edison project ending in failure. Damn. It could happen to anybody! I must continue. At that time CD-ROM sales had bombed, so investors were fleeing from the field. I didn't turn away from mine entirely, but instead linked it to the Internet. My plan was to offer consumers descriptions of home-design products by using a special software and let them modify the designs. Then we can enable them to get online professional and constructional help to have their houses built, decorated and furnished according to their own choice. To realize my plan I needed investors, so I continued to meet regularly with venture capitalists. One said I had a great idea. But I needed to test it. Get the money somewhere. To get this money from a venture capitalist is going to cost my wife and my children! He turned down my request. Wife? Children? I hardly remembered them. I was working nonstop --- struggling to turn the key in the lock, to find the right way ahead. The pressure was terrible. It was just at this time that my parents and sisters stepped up.

What can be the best title for the passage?	"My summer hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2 go 2 NY 2C my bro, his CF & thr 3:-@ kids FTF ILNY, its gr8. Can you understand this sentence? If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the ""translation"" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great. Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes cxan be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. ""People get better at writing by writing,"" he says, ""Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents."" Linguist James Millroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become ""corrupted""; they simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, ""I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future."" Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, ""I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun"""	['Is Netspeak Harming the English Language?']

According to the passage, the Donkey Mobile Library _ .	"It is a bright morning in the Ethiopian countryside. Yohannes walks beside a pair of donkeys that are pulling a two-wheeled cart. They arrive at the agricultural town of Awassa where Yohannes opens the sides of the cart to display, not the usual vegetables or tools, but children's books. This is the Donkey Mobile Library, the first of its kind in Ethiopia and one of only a few in the world. Yohannes was born in Ethiopia, North Africa, but trained to be a librarian in the USA and returned to Ethiopia years ago. The cart is full of picture books donated by American libraries, teachers and school children. Yohannes arranges small painted benches in the shade of the trees, and suddenly Ethiopian children come shouting and racing down every road and path. It's mobile library day! They circle the bookshelves with great excitement. Until the Donkey Mobile Library began its regular two-monthly visits, many of these children had never seen a book. ""Without books, education is very dull, like food without salt. You can survive but you can't really come alive,"" says Yohannes. ""The ability to read is the basis for greater productivity, better health and longer life. Even though the children lack material goods, with books they can imagine a world of possibilities."" Yohannes first worked in the children's section of the main library in America. Surrounded by books he had never seen before, he realized how joyful and imaginative children's literature is. He says, ""I always thought of Ethiopia. But how could I bring children's books to my home country when it had almost no libraries to keep the books in?"" He contacted Jane Kurtz, a writer born in America but brought up in Ethiopia, and together they created the Donkey Mobile Library. The children say that the Library has given them ideas about what they might do in the future. A child called Dareje wants to be a scientist and find a cure for life-threatening diseases. An eleven year-old girl, Fikerte, wants to do research about the moon and discover new facts about outer space. Tamrat, aged 10, comes every time. ""What brings you back here time and time again?"" the librarian asks him. ""The stories,"" Tamrat replies instantly."	['benefits Ethiopian children a lot']
Abramson probably agrees that _ .	"Researchers believe the mobile phone system makes young people less thoughtful and more likely to make mistakes elsewhere in life. Hitting a few keys and then seeing the desired word appear in full trains children to be fast but inaccurate when doing other things, according to Australian scientists. They warn that this could have _ throughout the country, especially as more than 9 out of 10 16-year-olds now own a mobile phone as well as 40 percent of primary schoolchildren. In a new study, Professor Michael Abramson, a researcher at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, analyzed the mobile phone use of children aged between 11 and 14 and their ability to carry out a number of computer tests. A quarter of the children made more than 15 voice calls a week and a quarter of them wrote more than 20 text messages a week. When researchers studied the way in which the children handled IQ-type tests they found that increased mobile phone use appears to change the way their brains work. Prof Abramson said, ""The kids who used their phones a lot were faster on some of the tests, but were less accurate. ""We suspect that using mobile phones a lot, particularly tools like predictive texts for SMS (Short Message Service), is training them to be fast but inaccurate. ""Their brains are still developing, so if there are effects then potentially it could have effects in the future. ""The use of mobile phones is changing the way children learn and pushing them to become more impulsive in the way they behave."" Experts concerned about the possible impact of mobile phone radiation on developing brains have given a warning over children's use of them. But Prof Abramson says the amount of radiation given off when texting is a mere 0.03 percent of that given off during voice calls - suggesting radiation is not to blame for the brain effects. Instead, he thinks predictive texting could be doing the damage. The study was published in the journal Bioelectromagnetics and disagreed with previous studies which suggested that text messaging encourages children's language skills and did not damage their ability to spell."

Inspired by the case of his son, the author began to doubt _ .	I am a strong believer that if a child is raised with approval, he will learn to love himself and will be successful in his own way. Several weeks ago, I was doing homework with my son in the third grade and he kept standing up from his chair to go over the math lines. I kept asking him to sit down, telling him that he would concentrate better. He sat but seconds later, as if he didn't even notice he was doing it, he got up again. I was getting frustrated, but then it hit me. I started noticing his answers were much quicker and accurate when he stood up. Could he be more intent while standing up? This made me start questioning myself and what I had been raised to believe. I was raised to believe that a quiet, calm child was a sure way to success. This child would have the discipline to study hard, get good grades and become someone important in life.www.zxxk.com Now those same people perhaps come to realize that their kids are born with their own sets of DNA and personality traits and all you can do is loving and accepting them. As parents, throughout their growing years and beyond that, we need to be our kids' best cheer leaders, guiding them and helping them find their way. I have stopped asking my son to sit down and concentrate. Obviously, he is concentrating just in his own way and not mine. We need to learn to accept our kids' ways of doing things. Some way may have worked for me but doesn't mean we need to carry it through generations. There is nothing sweeter than being individual and unique . It makes us free and happy and that's just the way I want my kids to live their own life.	['the old form of education']

What does the passage mainly talk about?	At the beginning of every year we promise ourselves we will live a healthier life, and exercise more. The year tarts with the best of intentions, but many times we are unable to keep up with very high goals. Good news is that a healthy lifestyle is achievable and it's all about making small changes that make a difference. News on healthy lifestyles says that the key is moderation and consistency. There are so many health and well-being products out there in the market promising many things. And although many may be true, select carefully. The basics of a healthy lifestyle is maintaining a balanced diet and doing regular exercise. By eating well, it means really to make sure you include plenty of vegetables and fruit preferably in season in your diet, avoid fried and junk foods and foods high in sugar as well as processed foods. Eating fresh homemade meals rather than ready-made meals which are high in salt and sugar is always the better option. Reducing alcohol intake, drinking plenty of water and supplementing your diet with healthy snacks like nuts and seeds. For external care choose natural skin care products and hair care oil. Natural beauty care involves using natural moisturizers like Argan oil, Coconut oil and Sweet Almond oil. These nourish the skin far more than counter creams full of chemicals. Skin reflects what we put inside of us, so a healthy diet with plenty of greens and healthy protein will make your skin brighter. Of course exercise is essential but the key is regular and consistent exercise. So walking three times a week for 45 minutes is much more beneficial than a binge workout once a week.

What do we know about Iceberg Water from the passage?	"Reading new peaks of popularity in North America is Iceberg Water which is harvested from icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada. Arthur von Wiesenberger, who carries the title Water Master, is one of the few water critics in North America. As a boy, he spent time in the larger cities of Italy, France and Switzerland, Where bottled water is consumed daily. Even then, he kept a water journal, noting the brands he liked best. ""My dog could tell the difference between bottled and tap water."" He says. But is plain tap water all that bad? Not at all. In fact, New York's municipal water for more than a century was called the champagne of tap water and until recently considered among the best in the world in terms of both taste and purity. Similarly, a magazine in England found that tap water from the Thames River tasted better than several leading brands of bottled water that were 400 times more expensive. Nevertheless, soft-drink companies view bottled water as the next battle-ground for market share-this despite the fact that over 25 percent of bottled water comes from tap water: PepsiCo's Aquafina and Coca-Cola's Dasani are both purified tap water rather than spring water. As diners thirst for leading brands, bottlers and restaurateurs salivate over the profits. A restaurant's typical mark-up on wine is 100 to 150 percent, whereas on bottled water it's often 300 to 500 percent. But since water is much cheaper than wine, and many of the fancier brands aren't available in stores, most dines don't notice or care. As a result, some restaurants are turning up the pressure to sell bottled water. According to an article in The Street Journal, some of the more shameless tactics include placing attractive bottles on the table for a visual sell, listing brands on the menu without prices, and pouring bottled water without even asking the dinners if they want it. Regardless of how it's sold, the popularity of bottled water taps into our desire for better health, our wish to appear cultivated, and even a longing for lost purity."

The first man came at eight. David took him to the kitchen. At half past nine another man arrived. He had a bag under his arm. ""Mr Moore?"" the man asked. ""That's right,"" David said. ""Can I help you?"" ""I've got some good books. You buy books, don't you?"" ""Yes. Bring them in. Let me have a look."" Soon the books were on the dining-table. ""Come in now,"" David called, ""and bring the list."" A policeman came into the dining-room. He read the names on the books and the names on the list in his hand. They were the same.

Why didn't the vet give the cat X-rays immediately?	"Driving home from work one evening in the heavy rain, I found a very wet, injured cat on the side of the road. He looked up at me, meowing pitifully. A car must have hit it so it wasn't able to move. I stopped my car and carried the cat in and went on driving. At the nearest vet clinic, the vet gently examined it. ""He's about eight months old and has two broken legs, but I would need X-rays to know how serious the damage is,"" he told me. ""As he's not your cat, I don't know if you want to go ahead with this. It could be rather expensive."" I knew it would cost me hundreds of dollars, but I agreed with his advice. The following morning the vet rang to say the X-rays confirmed two bad breaks in his legs. ""I'll operate on his legs and put metal pins in them to keep them fixed."" he told me. That afternoon I went to pick up my little friend. There I could hardly recognize him. His previously dirty fur was now a beautiful silver grey. His front legs were in two casts and he lay there looking at me, purring happily. I thanked the doctor and went out to pay the bill. ""I think you've given me the wrong account,"" I said to the clerk. ""This is only $85. He's had X-rays and an operation on his legs."" ""No, that's right,"" she replied. ""The vet has only charged you for the medication. There's a message on the bottom."" Written under the total were the words ""SPECIAL RATE FOR ADOPTIONS."" I was speechless at his kind and generous gesture. I paid the account and under his message I wrote ""WITH GRATEFUL THANKS, CAT AND MUM."""	"[""The doctor wasn't sure whether the author would like to cover the expenses.""]"
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"The Erie Canal was the first important national waterway built in the US. It crossed New York from Buffalo on Lake Erie Troy to Albany on the Hudson River. It joined the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean. The canal served as a route over which industrial goods could flow into the west, and materials could pour into the east. The Erie Canal helped New York develop into the nation's largest city. The building of the canal was paid for entirely by the state of New York. It cost $ 7 143 789, but it soon gained its price many times over. Between 1825, when the canal was opened, and 1882, when toll charges were stopped, the state collected $121 461 891. For a hundred years before the Erie was built, people had been talking about a canal which could join the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. The man who planned the Erie Canal and carried the plan through was De Witt Clinton. Those who were against the canal laughingly called it ""Clinton's Ditch "". Clinton talked and wrote about the canal and drew up plans for it. He and Governor Morris went to Washington in 1812 to ask for help for the canal, but they were unsuccessful. Clinton became governor of New York in 1817, and shortly afterwards, on July 4, 1817, broke ground for the canal in Rome, N.Y. The first part of the canal was completed in 1820. As the canal grew, towns along its course developed fast. The length of the canal is 363 miles."	['Construction of the canal took eight years.']

We know from the passage that _ .	Most of us fear getting up and speaking in public. Many people don't like to go gathering where they don't know anyone, but while most of us soldier on , those with social anxiety disorder are often stopped by the terror and worry. Research shows that around fifteen million Americans suffer from social anxiety disorder. People in this condition feel that they are always being watched. Even though they know these fears are unreasonable, they cannot overcome their fears on their own. Social anxiety disorder sufferers are often misdiagnosed with conditions such as schizophrenia and personality disorder. Many feel lonely, and are unsure whether anyone else can understand their thoughts and emotions. This can lead to withdrawal from most social situations, even to being unable to hold employment. Those who suffer from social anxiety disorder are often dismissed as being shy. This is simply not the case; shyness is not even a symptom of social anxiety disorder. The majority of sufferers find their symptoms linked to specific situations, rather than all types of social interactions. An important step in overcoming social anxiety disorder is seeking out a therapist who specializes in training this type of disorder. Group treatment has been shown to be especially effective. Medication also help reduce the symptoms, but it should not be used as a replacement for psychotherapy . On your own, you can help reduce the symptoms by taking deep breaths and practising medication or prayer. Alcohol and nicotine should be avoided, as both can cause panic attacks. Exercises can relieve the symptoms, because it burns up the chemicals in your body that cause stress.	['psychotherapy is very important in treating social anxiety disorder']
It can be inferred from the passage that the writer _ .	"It doesn't matter if you have one friend or 20, because there are only a few people in this world that can make you truly happy. For me, my family and my three best girlfriends mean everything to me. Some days I didn't want to go to school because I felt so disappointed in myself but I don't regret a thing. It makes you stronger as a person, and if you are able to mend your friendships like I have done, then you can do anything. My mom always told me, ""Stephanie, remember that a friend is a gift that you give to yourself. A friend will always be there for the good and the bad. A true friend will never make fun of you. If a friend is a piece of work, then he or she has never been a friend at all. A friend is the biggest gift to you."" Everyone is going to make mistakes but please don't push them away, especially if it's someone you really care about. I know when I make mistake I beat myself up about it. I just wish someone would have reached out a hand to help me back up on my feet like my best friend did. If someone is new or doesn't have a friend, please reach out and befriend them because that small action could mean the world to them. Now that I'm older, I understand what my mom has been trying to tell me, and now I know that the friends that I choose will also be the kinds of friends that I would want to be surrounded by forever."

In what way does the author benefit from geocaching?	When I first heard about geocaching ,I was skeptical. But the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like an interesting idea.I at least wanted to try it once. Having familiarized myself with how the game works,I set out in search of my first cache. My trip took me through a series of lively hutong ,past a number of small temples, and right into the courtyard of a quiet youth hotel.I spent several minutes looking around, but couldn't find anything. Just before l was about to give up,I spotted a colorful object in the crack of a wall. Could it be the hidden cache? At that moment a group of backpackers amved. According to the game's rules, people who are not in the game must not be allowed to find out about secret caches. So I pretended to make a phone call while waiting for them to leave. When the coast was clear,I grabbed the object. It was the cache! I opened it and pulled out a crumpled sheet of paper with several names and celebratory messages written on it.I added my own and replaced the cache in its hiding place, ready for the next geocacher to find. It may seem like a simple game, but the idea that there are caches hidden all around us is exciting. Once you're hooked, it's easy to set yourself the goal of finding every single cache in a neighborhood or even an entire city. The real treasure, however, is not the cache itself, but the places it takes you to. Hunting for further caches has since introduced me to places which I didn't even know existed. Some are peaceful parks, while others are forgotten historical sites.A few caches have even been in places I passed regularly without giving them any thought. Now,Ifeel a much closer connection.

The writer didn't tell us in this passage that _ .	All over the world people enjoy sports.Sports help to keep people healthy,happy and help them to live longer. Sports change with the season. People play different games in winter and summer. Games and sports often grow out of people's work and everyday activities.The Arabs use horses or camels in much of their everyday life;they use them in their sports,too. Some sports are so interesting that people everywhere go in for them.Football,for example,has spread around the world.Swimming is popular in all countries near the sea or in those with many rivers. Some sports or games go back to thousands of years,like running or jumping.Chinese boxing,for example,has a very long history.But basketball and volleyball are rather new.Neither one is a hundred years old yet.People are inventing new sports or games all the time.

What's the passage mainly about?	"The Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park will open in Florida in 2009,and will provide attractions and rides based on places from the Harry Potter books. The novels' author JK Rowling has already given her blessing to the project. She said,""The plans I've seen look unbelievably exciting, and I don't think fans of the books or films will be disappointed."" Stuart Craig, the man in charge of the design of the park, is an Oscar-winning production designer who worked on the Harry Potter films so it should be faithful to JK Rowling's vision. Stuart Craig said, ""Our primary goal is to make sure this experience is an authentic extension of Harry Potter's world as it is _ in the books and films."" Visitors to the park will be able to explore some of their favourite places from the book such as the village of Hogsmeade, the Forbidden Forest and, of course, Hogwarts Castle, where Harry goes to school. Although fans can look forward to a holiday in the Harry Potter theme park, many will be saddened by the fact that the best-selling series is now drawing to a close. The final instalment in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, will be published on 21 July, and to mark the event JK Rowling is to read extracts from the book to a select audience at midnight on the day of publication. Rowling has announced that two characters die in the final book, but has not revealed if Harry is one of them so fans will have to wait to find out the fate of their magical hero."

"Catherine Destivetle is called ""a star"" because _ ."	"Catherine Destivelle is a rock star. She loves rock, but she can't sing or play the guitar! She is a rock climber and a big star in France and Italy. She is the most famous woman climber in the world because she often climbs without ropes. She climbs in many countries but most often in the French Alps near Chamonix, where she lives. She started climbing near her home in Paris when she was five. Then, at fourteen, she joined the French Alpine Club to learn more, but immediately she climbed better and more quickly than the older members of the club. She won her first competition in Italy in 1995. Three years ago she found a new route up the Dru Mountain near Chamonix. The climb took eleven days and for four days the snow was so heavy that she could not move. Last year other climbers tried to follow the new Destivelle Route, but they failed. They are going to try again this year. People always ask her about her climbing. She says, ""I climb because I'm in love with mountains. I like touching the rock and reading the face of the rock. I like it a lot. I felt at home on the side of a mountain. I prepare well before I go, so I'm never worried."" Catherine chooses new mountains from books--like buying from a shopping catalogue! ""I see a nice mountain and I go to climb it!"" Her next mountain is in Pakistan. She is going there next month. ""It's much bigger than the Dru, so it's going to take longer to climb.

According to the manual, each participating student of PISA should _ .	Thank you for agreeing to be a Test Administrator for PISA. The purpose of this manual is to help you to understand how you will assist with the successful implementation of this large-scale student survey. 1.1. What is PISA? PISA stands for the Programme for International Student Assessment, sponsored by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). PISA 2015 is the sixth PISA study that has been conducted since 2000 and involves more than 70 participating countries. PISA has the following characteristics: * It is the world's largest international survey in education. * It surveys students aged about 15 years. * It assesses students' preparedness for adult life. Undertaking PISA is important because the results of the test can be used: * to indicate how well prepared students in a country/economy are for learning once they leave school; * to identify areas for improvement over time by schools, education systems, and governments; and * to allow a comparison of student performance and the learning environment between different countries. 1.2. Components of PISA 2015 * 1.2.1. Cognitive test 42 students from each school will be randomly sampled to complete a 2-hour computer-based test consisting of questions in science, mathematics, reading, and Collaborative Problem Solving. * 1.2.2. Questionnaires These students will also be asked to complete a 30 minutes Student Questionnaire on the computer either directly after the test sections or at a later time. * 1.2.3. Financial Literacy assessment After the cognitive test and questionnaires, a sub-sample of 10-11 students will take a computer-based Financial Literacy(FL) assessment. The 65-minute Financial Literacy assessment tests students' knowledge of personal finances and their ability to apply it to their financial problems.	['carry out all the tasks on the computer']

Economics can help one make better decisions because he learns _ .	Economics is the study of how societies with limited resources decide what to produce, how to produce and for whom to produce. What, how, and for whom to produce are problems all over the world because human needs are practically unlimited, but all societies have only limited quantities of resources that can be used to produce goods or services. A knowledge of basic economics is important for understanding both the problems and opportunities that will face the world economy in the 21st century. As a student of economics, one will have the chance to discover how commerce , government policies, and day-to-day decisions made by consumers affect his living standards. The study of economics can help him understand the influence of such events as the move to free markets in prefix = st1 /PolandandRussia, or of ups and downs in interest rate and the foreign exchange rate. Economics is influenced by developments in the many different areas of business, politics, science, nature, religion and history. And whether or not one is aware of it, economics is an important part of his life. From a practical point of view, one's study of economics will help improve his decision-making skills. He learns a logical way to compare different courses of action. As he studies the concept of opportunity cost, for instance, he will discover that every choice he makes has both a benefit and a cost. Suppose someone decides to get a part-time job so he can earn enough money to buy a car. He will have the benefit of owning the car, but he will pay a cost in terms of the leisure hours he gives up for working so as to pay for the car and keep it in good condition. After weighing his choice in cost-benefit terms, he may decide he does not need a car any more.	['how to weigh the cost and the benefit']

The first day they come to Disney parks, all new employees_.	"Millions of people pass through the gates of Disney's entertainment parks in California, Florida and prefix = st1 /Japaneach year. What makes these place an almost universal attraction? What makes foreign kings and queens and other important people want to visit these Disney parks? Well, one reason is the way they're treated once they get there. The people at Disney go out of their way to serve their ""guests"", as they prefer to call them, and to see that they enjoy themselves. All new employees, from vice presidents to part-time workers, begin their employment by attending Disney University and taking ""Traditions I"". Here, they learn about the company's history, how it is managed, and why it is successful. They are shown how each department relates to the whole. All employees are shown how their part is important in making the park a success. After passing ""Traditions I"", the employees go on to do more specialized training for their specific jobs. No detail is missed. A simple job like taking tickets requires four eight-hour days of training. When one ticket taker was asked why it took so much training for such a simple, ordinary job, he replied, ""What happens if someone wants to know where the restrooms are, when the parade starts or what bus to take back to the campgrounds?...We need to know the answers or where to get them quickly. Our constant aim is to help our guests enjoy the party."" Even Disney's managers get involved in the daily management of the park. Every year, the mangers leave their desks and business suits and put on special service clothes. For a full week, the bosses sell hot dogs or ice cream, take tickets or drive the monorail , and take up any of the 100 jobs that make the entertainment park come alive. The managers agree that this week help them to see the company's goals more clearly. All these efforts to serve the public well have made Walt Disney Productions famous. Disney is considered by many as the best mass service provider in Americaor the world. As one longtime business observer once said, ""How Disney treats people, communicates with them, rewards them , is in my view the very reason for his fifty years of success... I have watched, very carefully and with great respect and admiration, the theory and practice of selling satisfaction and serving millions of people on a daily basis, successfully. It is what Disney does best."""	['begin by receiving on-the-job training']
What's the best way to solve the biggest problem of vandalism?	Our children and grandchildren may not have a chance to visit many of the most famous places around the world. War, weather, age, traffic and pollution damage these famous places. Looking after these places often costs more than one country can afford. In the early 1970s, world governments decided that if they joined together, they would be able to preserve our history. If every country paid some money, they said, it would be possible to look after important historic places. Also, if they discovered that a monument needed urgent help, they would have money for repairs. For these reasons, countries around the world united to form the World Heritage Organization in 1972. Today, the organization helps to maintain and restore the most important places from our history. However, one of the biggest problems for historic places is vandalism. People sometimes enter the sites and destroy or damage the buildings. At some sites, such as Stonehenge in England, governments have built high fences to protect the site from vandals. There are many different ideas about how to solve the problem of vandalism. Some experts say that if guards patrolled the sites, vandals would not be able to get in. Some experts say that if they fixed more television cameras, they would not need so many guards. Other experts say that the best solution is education. If people learned to respect history, they would not destroy or damage it. They would also want to spend money looking after old places. For this reason, the World Heritage Organization helps to spread information about the value of historic sites.	['To make people know information about the value of historic sites.']
In the writer's opinion, to make yourself competitive in the changing world today is _ .	One of the biggest challenges facing students and their families is what career they should enter and what is the best path for them to take. I was talking to someone the other day who told me he first studied accounting because that was what everyone was studying several years ago. It was and some say still is a reliable career. However, then he told me that he was now studying financial investment because again--- that's what everyone was studying now and it was needed if he wanted to get ahead in the company. And I asked him what he was actually interested in and then-- well the conversation kind of died. So I asked why he had bothered studying accounting in the first place and he explained that it was his parents' idea. Finally I asked what his passion was and he wasn't too sure because he never thought about it. And so it is-- lifelong learning-- or the continual need to make ourselves marketable in a world that appears to be more competitive as time goes by. Is there a secret to help us so we can live a life of quality? Regardless or not at this stage in world history with increasing connection between people, ideas and markets -- the ability to match the needs and desires of the day with your own skills and products is a tremendous and vigorous challenge. Many have gone into English or foreign language study because it was encouraged at the time when China was entering the WTO. Or maybe they were interested in international affairs or working abroad. Upon graduation they then faced the reality that there was a limit to how many jobs they could apply for. Perhaps some then studied further doing courses for work such as a tour guide or translator/ interpreter. Many may have decided that going into teaching was more rewarding or stable. Others would have gone into media or advertising or conference management and acquired new skills along the way. This constant quest to remain ahead of the game makes many upset and exhausted. Some futurists who examine technology have even predicted that people should expect to change careers six or seven times during their lifetime! So if you are concerned by the nature of change, why not start spending more time looking at the most modern leading economies, institutions and their publications. A whole lot of changes are starting to happen yet there is no reason why this cannot be enjoyable, exciting and also rewarding. Our attitude, approach and willingness to continually learn and update our skills must remain strong. My tip is to track the work that our government is setting about to achieve. In particular, look at the people who have been chosen as the key support team and try to read behind the light surface news and look at their career development and examine the recent reports that they are now recommending the government move towards. Key industry development, new ways of dealing with information and new demands are creating opportunities for the students and workers of tomorrow -- if we stay prepared.	['necessary']
. Which of the following statements about loose dogs is TRUE according to the research?	In the eyes of dog lovers, the dog is man's best friend. But for much wildlife, loose dogs may be a dangerous enemy, according to a study by a biologist from Utah State University in the US. Based on much existing research and their own case studies, Julie Young of Utah State University and four other scientists conclude that loose dogs may represent a huge danger to wildlife, especially endangered species, by hunting down or worrying them and by spreading diseases. They also found that dogs, their worldwide numbers around 500 million, can cause more damage to wildlife and livestock than wolves and other enemies of these animals. Young gave examples from the US state of Idaho, where research showed the presence of dogs reducing some deer populations. On the Navajo American Indians' reservation in northeastern Arizona, packs of loose dogs are chasing livestock. They have killed populations of small animals such as rabbits and act as a disease carrier for rabies among people and other animals, she said. Loose dogs also were to blame for distemper outbreak leading to a die-off of endangered black-footed ferrets in northwestern Wyoming in the 1980s. The phenomenon is not just limited to US; it's a global problen. Julie Young once studied three endangered species in central Asia: wild sheep, gazelles and antelope. The rate of injury and death to these animals by loose dogs was very high. In another case, Young found that dogs, not wolves, as originally suspected, were responsible for a large number of livestock killings in the mountainous Basque country between Spain and France. Authors of the new study said the problem is likely to worsen as communities expand. Then how to deal with it? Indeed, in many countries, leash laws permit punishment of dog owners whose pets chase wildlife. But lawbreakers are rarely punished because the police lack both people and money. Young has low-cost solutions to the problem for dog lovers, though. They include public dog-training programs and vaccinating dogs against rabies and other illnesses.	['People used to think that wolves, rather than loose dogs killed livestock in the Basque  country.']
The main idea of the passage may be _ . .	"For many years, environmental problems have been a major concern to people. Almost all things are related to the word ""Green"", say, green buildings. A green building means not only the colour of the paint. Also,it refers to environmentally friendly houses,factories and offices. Green building means ""reducing the impact of the building on the land"", Taryn Holowka of the US Green Building Council in Washington D.C.said. According to Holowka,buildings account for 65 percent of total US electricity use. But green buildings can reduce energy and water use. Also,the buildings are often located near public transportation such as buses and subways,so that people can drive their cars less.That could be good for the environment,because cars use lots of gas and give off pollution. Green buildings are often built on developed land,so that the buildings don't destroy forests. Marty Dettling is the project manager for a building that put these ideas into action.The Solaire has been called the country's first green highrise building. According to Dettling,""We've reduced our energy use by onethird and our water by 50 percent."" The Solaire cuts energy in part by using solar power.""On the surface of the building we have solar panels which change the sun's energy into electricity,""Dettling explained. The Solaire also has lights that automatically turn off when people leave the room. In addition,the building has lots of windows,allowing people to use the sun for light during the day.The Solaire cuts water by reusing it. Not everyone is eager to move into a green building,however. Some people think that things like solar panels cost more money than more traditional energy source. Anyhow,Holowka said,""It is going to take off."""	['green buildings help save environment']
To be a responsible dog owner you need to do all the following EXCEPT _ .	Many people _ , only to find out that they are not ready for a pet. This often results in the dog being turned over to a shelter where it may not find another home. This can be avoided if potential pet owners take the time to figure out if they are truly ready for the responsibilities of pet ownership. Being a responsible pet owner involves a financial commitment that goes beyond buying dog food. There are also parasite prevention, boarding costs while traveling and the cost to care for the pet should it become ill or injured. That is not to say that one must be rich in order to have a dog, but it is important to be prepared for the expenses that come with being a pet owner. Another consideration is the time commitment. An owner away from home for 14 hours every day is not an ideal situation for a dog. A potential dog owner must also consider the time it takes to care for his or her pet, the time it takes to feed, walk, play with, bathe and clean up. Also, dogs require attention. Be prepared to spend time each day petting and playing with it. Dogs are dogs, and will act like dogs. This includes barking, digging, having accidents in the house and, possibly, destroying some of the owner's prized possessions, such as furniture, shoes and cell phones. If the above would cause an owner to want to get rid of the dog, then he or she is not yet ready to be a pet owner. Many wonderful pets end up in shelters simply because they acted like dogs!

Which is the possible reason why Ebola spreads in West Africa quickly?	"The virus ""Ebola"" is named after the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That's where the virus was discovered in 1976. A person can only get Ebola through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, for example, sweat or spit. Additionally, the virus can get into your body through your eyes and mouth if those areas come into contact with something that contains the bodily fluids of an infected person. That's why health care workers are supposed to keep themselves completely covered while treating patients. The deadliest Ebola outbreak is spreading fast in Western Africa, taking over 900 lives so far. The health systems in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are severely lacking in resources, and health care workers may not have access to adequate protective clothing when working in rural clinics, where the proper protections are lacking. Since Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia share a border; it's easier for people to move from one country to another, increasing the risk for disease spread. For now, all doctors can do is treat the symptoms and provide supportive care like monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing while making sure the patients' fluids are supplied. Sometimes patients are given antibiotics to treat other possible infections. The hope is to make the patient pull through the infection so their immune system can eventually clear the virus. The people who survive Ebola have created enough antibodies to kill it. There are several promising drugs and vaccines in development, but since Ebola is less common--and research about it is not well funded -- there is no drug or vaccine that has been approved for use in humans. Many of the other drugs and vaccines have not yet been tested in humans. The WHO (World Health Organization) is meeting next week to discuss whether experimental treatments should be used during this outbreak."	['Three western countries share a border.']
The main purpose of the passage is to _ .	"In a recently published book, I came across some exercises with interesting names such as fishbone diagrams, lotus flowers and clustering. As I used these exercises in my classes, I noticed that students were interested. They said more and wrote more. They enjoyed expressing their ideas and sharing them in groups. They were no longer passively _ , but actively taking part in the lesson. I find that creativity can act as a way to increase participation and improve fluency. Creativity has become a popular word in recent years. Scholars in arts, psychology, business, education and science are all working to get a deeper understanding of it. Robert J. Stemberg is a creativity specialist and Yale professor of psychology. He defines creativity as ""the ability to produce work that is both new (original) and appropriate(applicable to the situation ) "". This definition is useful, as we want our students to use language in a new way and to use it correctly and properly. Mot scholars say there are two types of creativity: big ""C"" creativity and small ""c"" creativity. Big ""C"" creativity refers to genius level thinking that results in artistic masterpieces and scientific breakthroughs. Small ""c"" creativity refers to everyday level thinking that can be used in any situation our emphasis is on the latter. While it goes without saying that any of our students could go on to be the next Picasso or Edison, our aim is to help students produce more ideas and use language in a new way."

Which is the best title? _ .	People usually talk about two groups of colours: warm colours and cool colours. Scientists think that there are also two groups of people: people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active . People think that red example is exciting sociable people, those who like to be with others like red. The cool colours are green, blue and purple. These colours, unlike warm colours, are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting but one scientist says that time seems to pass more slow in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggested that a warm colour such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or a restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating don't want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices of factories as the people who work there want time to pass quickly. Scientists don't know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that warm colours remind people of warm days and cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is low during winter, the sunlight appears quite blue. Because the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow.

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"Have you ever wondered how and why a fall leaf changes color? We first have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Plants are the world's food factories. Plants take water from the ground and take CO2from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and CO2into glucose . Glucose is a kind of sugar. Using it as food, plants get energy and grow. Plants using sunlight to turn water and CO2into sugar is called photosynthesis . _ helps photosynthesis. It gives plants their green color. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter, and trees ""know"" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. Trees rest during this time and live on the food they store during the summer. They begin to shut down their food -- making factories. As the green chlorophyII disappears from the leaves, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. These colors have been in the leaves all the time. We just can't see them in the summer, because they are covered up by the green chlorophyII. The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, glucose is caught in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn this glucose into a red color. The brown color of trees is made from waste left in the leaves. It is mixture of all these things. It makes the beautiful leaves during autumn. ."

The passage mainly tells us _ .	What's a good friend like? One may have different answers to this question at different ages. When he is very young, he may think a good friend must be together with him all day. And they can share everything together. If his friend doesn't give him food to eat once, he doesn't think they are good friends any more. But they will play together happily again very soon. When he grows older and studies in a middle school, his idea about a good friend changes. He thinks a good friend should be helpful and honest. A good friend should always help him with his lessons. A good friend should come to him when he is sad. And he is always ready to tell everything to his friend. If his friend tells others about his secrets, he may hate the friend. When he grows up, he may not think it's necessary for a good friend to be always honest. Everyone has his secrets. If the truth may hurt the friend, it's better to keep it secret from him than tell him about it. And he may think a good friend can give him some good advice when he has problems. He comes to understand that he shouldn't just ask friends for help and that he should also learn to do something for his friends.	['what a good friend means for a person at different ages']
"What is ""Big Brothers"" ?"	"Each country has many kind people who volunteer to take care of others. For example, some high school and university students in the US often spend many hours as volunteers in hospital or old people's homes. They read books for the people or they just visit them and play games with them or listen to their problems. Other young volunteers go and work in the homes of the sick people. They clean up their houses or do the shopping. For boys who don't have fathers there is an organization called ""Big Brothers"". University students and other people take these boys to play baseball games and help them get to know things that boys usually learn from their fathers. Each city has a lot of clubs where boys and girls can go to play games or take part in other activities. Some of these clubs show movies or have short trips to the mountains, the beaches or the museums. Most of these clubs use a lot of high school and university students as volunteers because they can understand the problems of these boys and girls more easily. Volunteers believe that some of the happiest people in the world are those who help to bring happiness to others."	"[""It's an organization for boys who don't have fathers.""]"

What did Peary and Henson find in 1895?	In 1886 explorer Robert Peary traveled to Greenland for the U.S. Navy. Before his journey, no one knew Greenland's size or shape. On Peary's first trips, he explored Greenland, mapping parts of it. When Peary returned to the United States, he went to a businessman to sell some furs. There he met Matthew Henson, an African American mechanic, builder and navigator. When Peary went to Nicaragua on a Navy mission ,Henson went with him. When that job was over, the two headed to the Arctic. Henson and Peary set sail for Greenland. When they landed, Henson built a house for their base camp. Peary and his men set out to explore the land by dog sledge . Henson was injured and had to stay at the base. While there, he made friends with the Inuit, the native people. In 1895 Henson, Peary and Hugh Lee went out on another dog sledge journey. This time, they found Greenland's northernmost point. They now knew that the North Pole lay under the frozen Arctic Ocean. Peary had hoped to cross the ice. but the group ran out of food and returned to base camp. In the years that followed, Peary and Henson tried several times to reach the North Pole, but each time they failed. On one trip, Peary's feet froze, and he lost his toes . Peary and Henson planned last trip when Peary was 53 years old. They started across the sea ice from Ellesmere Island, which is located north of Canada. The temperature dropped as low as--51 degrees Celsius. The explores' cheeks froze , and they suffered snow blindness from the sun's glare. They experienced high winds and storms, and they also faced a hidden danger. Under the frozen ocean were powerful currents . The ice moved and broke apart leaving open water, called leads. Twice Peary fell into leads. But eventually he and Henson became the first persons to reach the North Pole.	['The North Pole is located in the Artic Ocean.']
In which section is this article most likely to be found in a newspaper?	"China will soon put its first domestically developed electric aircraft into mass production, and designers expect a huge market at home and abroad. ""The RX1E is scheduled to receive its airworthiness(,,)certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China before the end of this year, with production expected to start next year,"" Yang Fengtian, an academic at the Chinese Academy of Engineering told China Daily on Thursday. ""This will be the first electric aircraft to be certified by our civil aviation authority. The success of the plane means China has become a technology leader in this filed,"" he added. An electric aircraft runs on electric motors, with electricity coming from fuel cells, solar cells, ultracapacitors, power beaming or batteries. Most of today's electric aircraft are experimental demonstration models. The first manned, electrically powered flight was made in 1973. ""We plan to reach an annual production of 100 such aircraft within three years, and the construction of a manufacturing plant that can make 100 RX1Es each year has begun in Shenyang,"" Yang said, adding that the plane, together with a set of batteries, will sell for nearly 1 million yuan ($163,000).

What's the topic of 2013 World Water Day?	As we all know, people couldn't live without water. Some parts of our bodies are made of water. We depend on clean water to live every day. However, we human beings are polluting water seriously. In some areas of China, people are still in great need of clean water. Dirty water is one of the world's biggest healthy problems. It's harmful to our health. When water from the rain and melting snow runs through roads, it picks up some dangerous chemicals and other things along the way. Many of the rivers are short of protections, so they are easy to be polluted by factories or animals' waste. World Water Day has grown to become one of the important dates since 1993. In 2013, World Water Day shares the topic of Water Cooperation. If everyone tries their best to save and protect the clean water, our living conditions will be much better. ,.	['Water Cooperation.']
According to the author, writing _ .	"Writing being largely a self-taught occupation, texts on how to get about it -though great in number- seldom are of much use. You try, and fail. Then try again. Until at last, if you have some gift for it, the failures become less frequent, or at any rate less apparantly. It is this ability to cover up one's defects that is finally regarded as accomplishment or achievement. Along the way there are the discouragements of unkind criticism, outright rejection, troublesome insecurity and irregular inability to meet debts. It is uncommon, therefore, to come across a book containing advice of much practical value for anyone toying with the dangerous idea of staring on a writing life. A friend recently lent me such a book, however - one I wish I'd had the luck to read years ago, and which I would recommend to any young person devoted to making a career of words. It is the autobiography of the English novelist Anthony Trollope, first published in 1883, the year after his death. Needing some means to support himself, Trollope at age 19 worked as a junior clerk in the British postal service. He was at his desk at 5:30 each morning to write for three hours. And he remained in the mail service 33 years, long after reputation and prosperity had come to him. Now, what of his advice in his works? 1. For safety's sake, arm yourself with some other skills, some other line of work to fall back on . That way, failure at writing, though the disappointment may appear, will not mean ruin. 2. Do not depend too much on inspiration. Writing is a craft, which Trollope compared to the craft of shoemaking. The shoemaker who has just turned out one pair of his work sets to work immediately on the next pair. 3. Have a story to tell, but, more important than that, people with characters who will speak and move as living creatures in the reader's mind. Without memorable characters, story alone is nothing. 4. Meet your deadlines. Life is endlessly ""painful and troublesome"" for writers who can't finish their work on time. 5. Do not be carried away by praise. And, above all, do not be injured by criticism. 6. Understand the risks of writing for a living. ""The career, when successful, is pleasant enough certainly; but when unsuccessful, it is of all careers the most painful."""

Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?	"Many people have described television as a passive activity that is harmful to children's education. However, there are good and bad ways to watch television. Parents who are interested in exploiting television as a learning tool can actually turn time in front of TV into an educational chance. Probably the most familiar educational way to use television is to simply watch educational programs. In particular, this means selecting channels and programs specially designed for educational purposes. Along with traditional educational shows for children on public broadcasting channels, cable television now offers kids and adults a wide variety of educational programs, with everything from nature shows to historical events in different countries. Captioning ,such as ""closed captioning"" for hearing disabled viewers provides another way for parents to exploit the educational possibilities of television.One study showed that children who watched captioned TV got great improvement in their vocabulary and oral reading ability. In addition, parents can make any show a learning class by watching television together with children. By actively joining children in the programs that they are watching, parents can help with the development of such skills as predicting and summarizing. In order to develop predicting skills, parents and children could first refer to a program's description in a viewing guide.After reading the program description and guessing what might happen in the program, parents and children could watch together to see which predictions were correct. And to practice summarizing, after watching a program, parents can turn off the TV and ask what the story was about. This kind of activity helps children develop thinking skills such as arranging events in an order and memorizing information. Although there will still be plenty of times when children watch TV simply for passive enjoyment, parents can help make at least part of their children's viewing time a more productive activity.Used intelligently by exploiting the learning chances available through various programs, television can play an instructive role in children's education."

However, Senior 1 student Li Qinmei is happy taking her father with her as long as she can go to classes. He is disabled and unable to take care of himself. The 16-year-old country girl in Zhucheng, Shandong Province has experienced one disaster after another in her short life. Li lost her mother at three. Four years later, her father became paralyzed after a tractor accident. At 12, her misfortune returned with the death of her grandma. Since then she has been forced to shoulder all the responsibility for her broken family. Li learnt to cook and managed to live a life with an allowance of only 24 yuan per month. The most difficult thing she had to deal with was helping her father bathe, dress and use the toilet as he could hardly move. ""I felt embarrassed, and so did my dad. It was really hard at the beginning,"" she recalled. During most of her junior school years, Li went to classes only once a month as her father was seriously ill at the time. ""I taught myself at home and asked teachers for help on my school days,"" she explained. Li's hard work paid off this fall. She was admitted by Zhucheng No 1 High School, a local key school, based on her good performance in the entrance exams.

According to the researchers, the origin of the event was _ .	"At dawn on Friday, May 19, 1780, farmers in New England stopped to wonder at the pink color of the sun. By noon the sky had darkened to midnight blackness, causing Americans, still in the painful struggle of a prolonged war of independence, to light candles and tremble at thoughts of the Last Judgment. As the birds quieted and no storm accompanied the darkness, men and women crowded into churches, where one minister commented that ""The people were very attentive."" John Greenleaf Whittier later wrote that ""Men prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp . . ."" A recent study of researchers, led by Richard Guyette from the University of Missouri's Tree Ring Laboratory, has shown that vast forest fires in the Algonquin Highlands of southern Ontario and elsewhere in Canada brought this event upon New England. The scientists have discovered ""fire scars"" on the rings for that year, left when the heat of a wildfire has killed a part of a tree's cambium . Evidence collected also points to a drought that year. An easterly wind and low barometric pressure helped force smoke into the upper atmosphere. ""The record fits pretty close,"" says Guyette. ""We had the right fuel, the drought. The conditions were all there."" Lacking the ability to communicate quickly over long distances, Americans in 1780 remained in the dark about the event, which had disappeared by the next day. Over the next several months, the papers carried heated debates about what brought the darkness. Some were the voices of angry prediction, such as one Massachusetts farmer who wrote, ""Oh! Backsliding New-England, attend now to the things which belong to your peace before they are forever hid from your eyes."" Others gave different answers. One stated that a ""flaming star"" had passed between the earth and the sun. Ash, argued another commentator. The debate, carried on throughout New England, where there were no scientific journals or academies yet, reflected an unfolding culture of scientific enquiry already sweeping the Western world, a revolution nearly as influential as the war for independence from the English. New Englanders would not soon forget that dark day; it lived on in folklore, poems, and sermons for generations."	['a severe drought']
The text is most likely to be found in a book about _ .	"Combining families with kids can be tough and offers even more unexpected problems. You just don't know how things will shake out until everyone is under one roof, trying on new roles with name that start with ""step"". This is what happened to Sheila and Will, and Sheila's 8-year-old daughter Ashley. After the couple got married, and Will became the member of the new family, things got worse than expected. How did they make it work? Read the full version of the story here. Shelia's Turn: When Shelia and Will were dating, he seemed like kids, especially Ashley. He'd bring her presents, play games with her. But after the wedding, things took a turn. Will suddenly became a super strict stepfather, scolding Ashley for watching too much cartoons, constantly picking fights and punishing her for offenses as small as spilling milk. Shelia's thought about leaving Will, but soon after they married, they had a son, Billy. Will adores his well-behaved boy, but Ashley hates him. Shelia doesn't know what to do--- her daughter is miserable, but leaving her husband might mean losing her son. Will's turn: Will was so excited to be a male role model in Ashley's life. He didn't just want to be a guy living in her house; he wanted to treat her like his own daughter, which, to Will, meant giving Ashley more rules and help her learn responsibility. He'd always felt that Shelia let Ashley loose on everything. But after the wedding, Will was surprised that Shelia didn't want him to do that. If Will takes away Ashley's TV privileges or tells her to clean up her room, Shelia just lets Ashley do what she likes and does it herself. Will was tired of this and he'd rather take his son and go. The advisor's turn: The counselor quickly recognized their conflict as a classic case of unspoken, hidden expectations. Before the wedding, when it was just Shelia and Will, everything was easy. But now, everyone in their big family is competing for attention, and the couple never sat down and discussed the biggest issue---their child-upbringing philosophies . The counselor suggested Shelia allow Will to give some rules on Ashley but Will's punishments couldn't be extreme. Once Ashley saw that her mom and stepdad had become a united front, she cooperated more."	['social problems']

What may cause the risk of diseases according to the text?	"Since 1950, the amount of information about the nutrition of food has increased by nearly 900 percent. Besides this fact, obesity has risen by 214 percent and nearly two out of every three adults in America are overweight or obese. Being overweight is not only an appearance problem, and it also increases the risk of various diseases including diabetes, sleep disorder and cancer. With so much nutritional knowledge easy to find, we cannot simply ignore our present obesity epidemic . We know that fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamin. Though we are overweight, many of us choose junk food over healthy food out of habits. One explanation for our strong desire for junk food is that we learn to connect junk food with positive feelings when we are young, and changing this attitude requires a huge amount of confidence and determination. Fortunately, new research published in May 2012 has shown a simple and _ way to make healthier food choices- the one that doesn't rely on great determination. The research was based on two separate studies and it was carried out by T. Bettina Cornwell of the University of Oregon and Anna R. McAlister of Michigan State University. In the first study, 60 adults between the ages of 19 and 23 were questioned about the role of food and drinks. The survey tells us that adults prefer sweetened drinks with high-calorie, salty foods, to sweetened drinks with vegetables. In the second study, 75 children between the ages of 3 and 5 were gathered for some experiments including drinks served with vegetables. The preschooler experiments were carried out under different situations and on different days. The researchers found that the children chose to take more green vegetables when they were served with water instead of a sweetened drink. According to Cornwell, children learn to connect high calorie, sugary drinks such as cola, with high fat foods such as French fries, from a very early age. McAlister adds that early taste development appears to play an important role in food choices later in life. Meals served at home and meals offered at restaurants, set the stage for this idea and for the preference to choose junk food over healthy food, when beginning to take sweetened drinks. ""Our taste preferences are heavily influenced by regularly eating particular food and drinking particular drink,"" states Cornwell. ""If the drink on the table goes against both adults and children eating their vegetables, then perhaps it is time to change that drink... and to serve water with all meals. Restaurants could easily use water as free drink for children's meals and charge extra money for other drinks."" Both McAlister and Cornwell are confident that serving water with meals could effectively reduce the nation's obesity rates, diabetes rates and ever rising healthcare costs."	['Obesity.']
What does this passage mainly talk about?	There is good news for old people with Alzheimer's disease . As we know, people who have Alzheimer's disease may get lost easily. Sometimes they can't find the way to their home. All the family members must be worried about their safety. Now, some has invented GPS-enabled walking shoes. The shoes are very special and useful. They can help people find old people easily, wherever they go. These walking shoes are especially important for people who are in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease. According to the research, such old people have the highest danger. Let's see some terrible facts. About 60c/o of patients with Alzheimer's disease get lost for days when they go for a walk. Up to half of those who are lost and not found within 24 hours can die outside. If old people wear such shoes , you needn't worry about that. These shoes can help their families to find _ easily if they are lost. So you see, the shoes can ensure old people's safety. These walking shoes are equipped with a GPS device in the heel. The shoes are very comfortable and they look like the shoes that many old people wear. The GPS-enabled walking shoes have a great advantage. Of course, the shoes are suitable for children .Parents can ask them to wear such shoes. Then they can find their children easily. But some children have different ideas. Sometimes, they don't want their parents to know where they are. What will they do? Well... some children say that they will take them off and put them at home.

You should be self-aware because _ .	"Miguel's co-workers don't quite understand him. One day he is smiling and friendly, a real team player. The next day, he is cross, getting angry over minor things, especially when asked to improve one of his designs. Identifying your personality characteristics is the first step in developing a good attitude. Are you a positive, confident person or are you shy and reserved? Do you face problems, looking for solutions, or do you feel someone to blame? Characteristics define you. They help you succeed, or they hold you back. Self-awareness, or understanding the factors that make up your personality, is an important step towards happiness, and happiness is the key characteristic of a good attitude. To become self-aware is to be aware of both your good and bad characteristics. What are the characteristics that people compliment on you? Are you dependable"", ""responsible"" or ""solid""? Pay attention to the compliment because they are a confirmation of your strongest characteristics. You can use these characteristics to create an even better image. People form opinions about you. Whether they are right or wrong doesn't enter the question. You, however, can change their opinions by demonstrating the personality characteristics and attitudes that match the way you want to be viewed. In becoming self-aware, understanding how others see you is an important step. This can be painful; but if you are brave enough to try it, it can be an excellent growth experience. Change is not easy, especially when it has to do with your behaviors. You should break the behavior change into small steps because small steps are easier to achieve and more likely to last. The change will be permanent if you want to change for yourself."	['it may help you on the way to success']
What is the price of the book?	Paperback: 264 pages Publisher:. Sams (March 29,2005) ISBN: 0672327627 Product Dimensions: 8.4x5.5x0.6 inches OVERVIEW This book offers straightforward practical answers when you need fast results. By working through each 10-minute lesson, you'll learn what you need to begin to use the PHP scripting language to make your websites interactive and dynamic. REVIEW When I first laid eyes on this book and its title, Teach Yourself PHP in 10 minutes, my first thought was that I was going to see this! So I opened it up and figured I'd look through it for ten minutes and see what would hit me. Well, 10 minutes turned into 20, 20 into 30 and 30 into a valuable resource that sits on my desk. Not only are the lessons within brief, but they are very easy to understand, well presented and very easy to understand for the beginner. Each lesson comes with tips to point out shortcuts, cautions to help you avoid common mistakes and notes to additional infomation. This book can be used in two ways, as a reference or as a complete tutorial on PHP basics. That alone is something that is very rare in teaching type books these days. Some of the more valuable and informative lessons will take you into the areas of: --Strings and variables --Processing HTML forms --Controlling and filtering data --User authentication --Cookies and sessions --Security practices --Configuring PHP and more!!! The book is pretty basic for experienced PHP coders, but for new or intermediate users this book is worth more than the small $19.99 CAN suggested price. Although the cover suggests it covers PHP 5.0, the coding found within also applies to PHP 4.X CONCLUSION This book completely surprised me with its value and does indeed teach you in ten minutes what other books claim to do in 24 hours. Full marks to author Chris Newman for this handy guide.	['$19.99 CAN.']
About 3.5% of Americans had electronic tablets in _ .	The rapid growth of Smartphones and electronic tablets is making the Internet favourite for Americans reading news, a report said. News consumption online increased 17% last year from the year before. Television news, newspapers, radio and magazines all lost audience last year. For the first time, the number of people who get news online at least three times a week is larger than the number of people who get news from the newspapers. TV news has been the most popular since the 1960s. It has replaced the afternoon newspapers. But now the online news seems to be more popular than the TV news. People are used to having the Internet available on phones or small tablets. In December, 2010, 41% of Americans said they got most of their news on the Internet, more than double the 17% who said that a year earlier, the report said. In January, 2011, 7% of Americans owned electronic tablets, nearly double what it was three months earlier. It was the fastest-growing new digital technology, ahead of mobile phones when they were introduced. The online ad income was expected to surpass print newspaper ad income for the first time in 2010. The news business used to be the intermediary . You needed newspapers and TV stations to reach your customers. In this age of the computer, it's the software developers that you need.

The tone of the letter is that of _	Cosmo Books Ltd., 14, Woodman Road, Hertford Estate, Two Bridges, Rickmansworth, West Sussex. Middx. 25thFebruary Dear sir, Just over six months ago, I saw an advertisement in the Morning Mail for a set of the complete works of William Shakespeare. Your company, Cosmo books Ltd., offered this set ( eight books of plays and two books of poetry) at what was claimed to be a 'remarkable' price: fifteen pounds and fifty pence, including postage and packing. I had wanted a set of Shakespeare's plays and poems for some time, and these books, in red imitation leather, looked particularly attractive; so I sent for them. Two weeks later, the books arrived, together with a set of the complete works of Charles Dickens which I had not ordered. So I returned the Dickens books to you, with a cheque for fifteen pounds and fifty pence for the works of Shakespeare. Two more weeks passed. Then there arrived on my door step a second set of the works of Shakespeare, the same set of novels by Dickens and a six book set of the plays of Moliere, in French. Since I do not read French, these were of no use to me at all. However, I could not afford to post all these books back to you, so I wrote to you at the end of August of last year, instructing you to come and collect all the books that I did not want, and asking you not to send any other books until further notice. You did not reply to that letter. Instead you sent me a bill for forty two pounds , and a set of the plays of Schiller, in German. Since then, a new set of books has arrived every two weeks, the works of Goethe, the poems of Milton, the plays of Strindberg; I hardly know what I have. The books are still all in their boxes, in the garage, and my car has to stand in the rain outside. I have no room for any more books, and even if I read from now until the Last Judgement, I should not finish reading all the books that you have sent me. Please send no more books, send no more bills, send no more angry letters demanding payment. Just send one large lorry and take all the books away, leaving me only with the one set of the complete works of Shakespeare for which I have paid. Yours faithfully, SIMON WALKER	['annoyance']
What was used in the experiment to cause coughing?	"Something in chocolate could be used to stop coughs and lead to more effective medicines, say UK researchers. Their study found that theobromine , found in cocoa, was nearly a third more effective in stopping coughs than codeine, which was considered the best cough medicine at present. The Imperial College London researchers who published their results online said the discovery could lead to more effective cough treatment. ""While coughing is not necessarily harmful it can have a major effect on the quality of life, and this discovery could be a huge step forward in treating this problem,"" said Professor Peter Barnes. Ten healthy volunteers were given theobromine, codeine or placebo, a pill that contains no medicine, during the experiment. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers knew who received which pill. The researchers then measured levels of capsaicin, which is used in research to cause coughing and as a sign of how well the medicines are stopping coughs. The team found that, when the volunteers were given theobromine, the capsaicin needed to produce a cough was around a third higher than in the placebo group. When they were given codeine they needed only slightly higher levers of capsaicin to cause a cough compared with the placebo. The researchers said that theobromine worked by keeping down a nerve activity , which cause coughing. They also found that unlike some standard cough treatments, theobromine caused no side effects such as sleepiness."	['Capsaicin.']
Why was the living door angry?	"Once upon a time, there were two doors in a house. One was a beautiful living room door, and the other was just a normal bathroom door. There were some naughty children in the house, and they always kicked the door. The living room door was always very angry about it and hated the children. The bathroom door didn't care too much when the children kicked him. Instead, he tried to comfort the living room door. He said, ""Don't worry. It's normal. They're children, and they'll grow up soon. Before long, things will be better."" One day, the living door finally lost his temper . A child kicked him, and he broke at once. The owner of the house got very angry and told the children to be careful next time. This made the living door happy. However, the owner didn't repair him; he threw him into a landfill instead. At the same time, the bathroom door took the place of the living room door. And the children treated him with greater care. The living room door realized his mistake. He shouldn't treat young children like that. He should learn to forgive others. The happiness from revenge will never last for long."	['Because the naughty children always kicked him.']
Parents should _ when their kids are older according to the passage.	Most parents hope that their children can be happy and successful. But do you know the most powerful way to encourage them to be so? The answer is to allow them to make their own decisions. Different people have different ideas about children's decision making. Unfortunately , most parents make decisions for their children--what they wear, what they eat and what movies they watch. In fact, it's not good for children's growing. Children should be allowed to make decisions when they are very young. But this doesn't mean they are allowed to do everything. For example, you shouldn't take your children into a convenience store and tell them they can have anything they want. They would be overwhelmed by the choices. But you can give them a choice among snacks. When children get older, expand the number of choices you give them. For example, allow them to decide the activities they want to take part in or when they decide to go to bed. The next step is to get your children to think before they act. Ask themselves several important questions. First, why do I want to do this? Second, what are my choices? Third, what are the results of the actions? After the three questions, they are sure to have right decisions.	['give them more chances to make decisions']
The software Dasher _ .	"A report on a new software that enables eyes to do the typing appears in Wednesday's edition of the journal Nature. Replacing a keyboard or mouse, eye-scanning-cameras mounted on computers have become necessary tools for people without limbs or those affected with paralysis. The camera tracks the movement of the eye, allowing users to ""type"" on a virtual keyboard as they look at the screen. And now, researchers from the Cavendish Laboratory at prefix = st1 /CambridgeUniversitysay they have developed software that replaces the standard QWERTY keyboard layout with one that is nearly twice as efficient, more accurate and easier on the eyes. Called Dasher, the prototype program looks into the natural gaze of the eye and makes predictable words and phrases simpler to write. Any off-the-shelf camera capable of scanning eye movement can be used with Dasher, though the person must sit fairly still during the interaction. The letters of the alphabet appear in a single column on the right of the screen, with an underline symbol to represent a space. Each letter is framed by a color1ed box. As the user looks at a particular letter on the right side of the screen and drags it to the left with their eye, another sub-alphabet column begins to emerge inside the box on the right-hand side, along with more letters framed in color1ed boxes. Dasher is designed to anticipate which letter will be needed, so although the successive sub-alphabet columns are initially very small, the letters or combination of letters that appear are most likely to be used next in that sequence. For example, if a person starts with the letter ""h"", the language models in Dasher will bring up ""a"" ""e"" ""i"" ""o"" and ""u"" in the sub-alphabet box, along with a few other possible combinations like ""ello"" to form the word ""hello"". Each box has a complete alphabet within it, though the first letters to appear have the highest probability of usage. The letters are then placed together to form a sentence on the left side of the screen. Researchers say people will be able to write up to 25 words per minute with Dasher compared to on-screen keyboards, which they say average about 15 words per minute. With a bit of practice, MacKay said, Dasher offers an easier and more satisfying way for disabled people to communicate, providing them with better tools to write e-mail or create word processor files. Mackay said Dasher could work in most languages."	['does not allow the user to move a lot during the interaction']
Michael Schumacher is in a coma after _ .	"On 23rd December, 2013, Michael Schumacher -- the famous Formula-One race car driver -- received serious brain injuries after hitting his head on a rock while downhill skiing with his son. The accident happened during a family holiday in the French Alps. Although he was wearing a helmet, which broke apart on impact, the F1 celebrity was moving at speeds of up to 62 mph and skiing outside the off-piste safety demarcations . Doctors reported that he would have died on impact if he hadn't been wearing a helmet. He has been in a coma since arriving at a nearby hospital where he was airlifted to from the site of the accident. Michael Schumacher grew up in frugal conditions and started what would become his remarkable professional career when his working class father -- a bricklayer -- built him a _ from where he started participating in competitions. He started his adult career racing for Formula Ford in 1988 and later raced for Formula One Ford, Ferrari, and Mercedes AMG. He holds numerous F1 world records including most race victories, fastest laps, and most races won in a single season. According to the Formula One website, he is ""statistically the greatest driver the sport has ever seen"". Also notable are his contributions to charity, during the peak of his career he has given away more than 50 million Euros to a variety of charity organizations, most to help children around the world. Millions of Europeans and other fans around the world are holding their breath and waiting for information about his hopeful recovery. We wish him and his family the best."

Which of the following statements can NOT be inferred from the passage?	"The Celerifere, an early version of the bicycle, was built around 1791 by a French man, Comte Mede de Sivrac. It was basically a scooter with a high seat. There were no pedals---you had to push with your feet like you do with a skateboard or a scooter. Around 1816 Baron Karl Drais de Sauerbrun in Germany added a moveable steering handle. These early machines were often known as dandy horses or hobby horses, but weren't very popular. The improvement that made them popular was added by a Scottish blacksmith around 1839. Kirkpatrick Macmillan added pedals to enable it to get up hills. It was this improvement that made the bicycle a serious form of transportation. Bike were called velocipedes or bone-shakers, because of the lack of the proper tires made for a rough ride! It wasn't until around 1869 that they began to be called bicycles (""two-wheels""). Carriage makers in Paris (either Pierre and Ernest Michaux, or their employee Pierre Lallement) switched the pedal to the front wheel. That's why it is usually either Lallement or the Michauxs, not Macmillan, who are considered as the inventor of the bicycle. In 1869 the penny-farthing or high-wheeler was invented. With the large wheel the rider could go much farther with each push of the pedal, but caused many accidents because the seat was so far off the ground. In the mid-1880s Englishman James Starley manufactured what he called the ""safety bicycle"" , which had two similarly-sized wheels and a major improvement--- a chain and sprocket driven rear wheel, with the pedals between the two wheels like modern bicycles. One more historical note---it's possible that the idea of the bicycle was thought of almost 400 years before it was actually invented. There is a drawing of a bicycle-like machine in one of Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, which dates back to about 1493."	"[""Comte Mede De Sivrac's invention had both a steering handle and pedals.""]"
In the 1700s, the deaf were taught _ .	"For many years, no one could communicate with people who had been born without hearing. These deaf people were not able to use a spoken language. But, beginning in the 1700s, the deaf were taught a special language. Using the language, they could share thoughts and ideas with others. The language they used was a language without sound. It was a sign language. How did this sign language work? The deaf were taught to make certain movements using their hands, faces, and bodies. These movements stood for things and ideas. People might move their forefingers across their lips. This meant, ""You are not telling the truth."" They might tap their chins with three fingers. This meant, ""my uncle"". The deaf were also taught to use a finger alphabet . They used their fingers to make the letters of the alphabet. In this way, they spelled out words. Some deaf people could spell out words at a speed of 130 words per minute. Sign language and finger spelling are not used as much as they once were. Today the deaf are taught to understand others by watching their lips. They are taught how to speak."	['a sign language']

Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?	"You're lost in the world of dreams and sleep. You roll over, smiling as you come across a swimming pool filled with chocolate. And then, your wonderful dream becomes a nightmare when someone is screaming, ""Get up!"" It's just what every teenager goes through each morning! Now, there seems to be one school that finally understands that requiring teens to show up at 9 am is not just cruel but also harmful to both the kids and the school. The Monkseaton High School in North Tyneside, Britain, recently decided to experiment to see if there is any difference in student behavior if they just pushed back the start of their day by one hour, from 9 am to 10 am. And the results are surprising. Since carrying out the later start, Monkseaton has seen a 28% drop in truancy, even hardly any lateness, and best of all, higher test scores. One of the reasons is that the teenagers are much happier to have the extra hour of sleep, but there is also a scientific reason behind why they need the extra sleep. The school's decision to push back the time was based on the research done by Oxford Professor Russell Foster, who pointed out that teenagers and adults have different sleep cycles, explaining why teenagers go to bed late and wake up late. While adults are wide awake and ready at 8 am, teenagers are not fully awake until 10 am, sometimes even noon. Teachers may argue that their students perform better in the morning, but in fact, it is because they are in the zone while their students are still sleepy, making the students easier to control. Memory tests prove that the more difficult classes should be in the afternoon when teenagers are most wide awake. The Monkseaton school officials are encouraged by the results and plan on voting to make it a permanent change."	['Teenagers perform better in the morning than in the afternoon.']
Why doesn't the writer like Anna?	"I think it's hard for a teenager to live in the modern society. For example, how to go to school is a problem I often worry about. Every afternoon, my father picks me up at the gate of the school. Many parents pick up their children, too. Most of them drive private cars. Of all the cars, Anna's father's car is the best. Anna seems to have a very rich father. She always has beautiful dresses, shoes and bags. Besides these, she is also very beautiful. But she has no friends in school. When other students are playing, she never joins them. I don't like her because she is too perfect. It makes me uncomfortable to make friends with her. She seems to have everything. One afternoon, when I went to my father's car, I saw a small thing fall out of Anna's bag. So I called her quickly. However, she didn't look back and kept going. I felt very angry with her. During the dinner, my father asked me, ""Why do you look unhappy?"" ""Today I saw something fall out of Anna's bag, so called her. But she didn't answer me. She is _ . "" said angrily. ""Oh, I know that girl. She has no friends and is unhappy because she was born deaf. I'm sure that she didn't hear you. "" What my father said suddenly woke me up. Because she is deaf, she does not talk or play with anyone at school. She seems to have everything, but in fact she doesn't. Not everyone is perfect, even the perfect man has his weakness."

There were very few people going to eat there. The owner was very worried about it. Then he thought of a good idea. A few weeks later, his restaurant was always full of men and their girlfriends. Whenever a gentleman came with a lady, a kind waiter would give each of them a beautiful menu. The menus looked exactly the same on the outside, but there was an important difference inside. The menu that the waiter handed to the man gave the correct price for each dish and each bottle of wine, while the menu that he handed to the lady gave a much higher price! So when the man calmly ordered dish after dish and wine after wine, the lady thought he was much more generous than he really was! The man could make a good impression on the lady.

Why did the author and his colleagues still keep working when the building began to shake?	"Earthquake is not an unfamiliar word to us as it is frequently covered on the news report. However, I never have the idea that it will take place in my city. But the truth is that it happened. When the building began to shake, I thought it was dizziness caused by long-time nonstop work and colleagues also kept silent till one of them shouted, ""The chair is shaking."" Then we came to understand it was not personal feelings, and we started to find the reason--the weak foundation of the building, or earthquake (in a joking tone), but we still kept doing what was in hand. It was kind of _ when I looked back, because of our slow reaction and stupid response. It was said that the staff in another building next to us all ran out of the building with their handbags; some of them even drove away. On hearing that, I thought it was a bitexaggeration . Did they really have to do so? It was only 20-second mild shaking. But now, when I totally get to know what happened, I change my mind. It is not over-reacting, but natural self-protection response. Luckily it's only the aftershocks; otherwise I guess I would be frightened to death. The aftershocks make me think what I'm going to do in case of earthquake, which I would never give a second thought before. I don't know what's on their mind for people who are on the spot of the earthquake, be frightened, at a loss, or simply running away, or trying to get contact with friends or... It is hard to imagine the picture and even harder to imagine what's next. For the first time, I have the feeling of insecurity. Humans are so fragile when they face the sudden disasters."	"[""Because they didn't take the shake seriously.""]"
According to the writer, _ is of great importance to readers.	"Reading is thought to be a kind of conversation between the reader and the text. The reader puts questions to the text and gets answers. In the light of these he puts further questions, etc. For most of the time this ""conversation"" goes on below the level of consciousness. At times, however, we become aware of it. This is usually when we are running into difficulties, when mismatch is occurring between our expectations and meaning of the text. When successful matching is being experienced, our questioning of the text continues at the unconscious level. Different people converse with the text differently. Some stay very close to the words on the pages; others take off imaginatively from the words, interpreting, criticizing, analyzing and examining. The former represents a kind of comprehension which is written in the text. The latter represents higher levels of comprehension. The balance between these is important, especially for the advanced readers. There is another conversation which from our point of view is equally important, and that has nothing to do with what is read but with how it is read. We call this a ""process"" conversation as opposed to ""content"" conversation. It is concerned not with meaning but with the strategies we employ in reading. If we are advanced reader our ability to hold a content conversation with text is usually well developed but not so our ability to hold a process conversation. It is just this kind of conversation that is of importance when we are seeking to develop our reading to meet the new demands being placed upon us by studying at a higher level."

Dudley got the information on making a 3-D printed braces from _ .	"Amos Dudley, a 24-year-old boy who studies digital design at New Jersey University of Technology, felt ashamed about his teeth. But being a student, Dudley didn't have the money to get braces . So, he decided to 3-D print his own and marked down the DIY project in a recent blog post. His braces totaled less than $60, and after wearing them for 16 weeks, his teeth are also getting straighter. Months ago, he mentioned on his blog that he avoided smiling for a while because he was unhappy with his teeth. However, clear braces can get pricey, costing up to $8,000. But after studying some images of these expensive clear braces, something comes up on him--they looked like that one which can come from a 3-D printer. So he decided to hit up his school's 3-D printing equipment and scanned and printed models of his teeth. He then made non-harmful plastic molds around them to make 12 sets of braces. Dudley, who does not recommend attempting any of this at home said that he didn't ask a dentist for his project. But the student did get information from journal articles and textbooks. And though this was a perfectly friendly choice to buy braces. He didn't accept the project just to save money--he was also up for the challenge. ""When I realized that I could do something that was a little bit special, while proving my skills as a designer and a maker, and fixing something that was making me self-conscious for actually free, I felt it was more than worth the risk."" he said."

Which of the following best describe Turin's work?	As more and more people speak the global languages of English, Chinese, Spanish, and Arabic, other languages are rapidly disappearing. In fact, half of the 6,000--7,000 languages spoken around the world today will likely die out by the next century, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In an effort to prevent language loss, scholars from a number of organizations--UNESCO and National Geographic among them--have for many years been documenting dying languages and the cultures they reflect. Mark Turin, a scientist at the Macmillan Centre Yale University, who specializes in the languages and oral traditions of the Himalayas, is following in _ . His recently published book, A Grammar of Thangmi with an Ethnolinguistic Introduction to the Speakers and Their Culture, grows out of his experience living, working, and raising a family in a village in Nepal. Documenting the Thangmi language and culture is just a starting point for Turin, who seeks to include other languages and oral traditions across the Himalayan reaches of India, Nepal, Bhutan, and China. But he is not content to simply record these voices before they disappear without record. At the University of Cambridge Turin discovered a wealth of important materials-including photographs, films, tape recordings, and field notes--which had remained unstudied and were badly in need of care and protection. Now, through the two organizations that he has founded-the Digital Himalaya Project and the World Oral Literature Project--Turin has started a campaign to make such documents, for the world available not just to scholars but to the younger generations of communities from whom the materials were originally collected. Thanks to digital technology and the widely available Internet, Turin notes, the endangered languages can be saved and reconnected with speech communities.	['Collect, protect and reconnect.']
What do we know about the invention of the LongPen?	"A world-famous Canadian author, Margaret Atwood, has created the world's first long-distance signing device , the LongPen. After many tiring book-signing tours from city to city, Atwood thought there must be a better way to do them. She hired some technical experts and started her own company in 2004. Together they designed the LongPen. Here's how it works: The author writes a personal message and signature on a computer tablet using a special pen. On the receiving end, in another city, a robotic arm fitted with a regular pen signs the book. The author and fan can talk with each other via webcams and computer screens. Work on the LongPen began in Atwood's basement . At first, they had no idea it would be as hard as it turned out to be. The device went through several versions, including one that actually had smoke coming out of it. The investing finally completed, test runs were made in Ottawa, and the LongPen was officially launched at the 2006 London Book Fair. From here , Atwood conducted two transatlantic book signings of her latest book for fans in Toronto and New York City. The LongPen produces a unique signature each time because it copies the movement of the author in real time. It has several other potential applications. It could increase credit card security and allow people to sign contracts from another province. The video exchange between signer and receiver can be recorded on DVD for proof when legal documents are used. ""It's really fun"", said the owner of a bookstore, who was present for one of the test runs. ""Obviously you can't shake hands with the author, but there are chances for a connection that you don't get from a regular book signing."" The response to the invention has not been all favorable. Atwood has received criticism from authors who think she is trying to end book tours. But she said, ""It will be possible to go to places that you never got sent to before because the publishers couldn't afford it."""	['Some versions failed before its test run.']
The Indian's way of life today is _ .	Bolivia has a population of three and a half million. About one tenth of the total population are white; one-fourth are mixed Indians and white; and more than half are full-blooded Indians. The government and the industries are under the control of the white people. The Indians today live in much the same way as their ancestors. Most of them are farmers. Many work in the mines, for mining is the most important industry on Bolivia's. Of all the mining products, tin is the most important, which makes up three-fourths of all Bolivia's exports. The eastern slopes of the Andes, since there are very few roads there, are fertile but not highly developed. The two primary means of transportation are river boats and porters. East of the hill region is the great plains where tropical plants are grown. A serious problem for Bolivia is the transport of food from the warm regions, where it is grown, to the mountainous regions, where most of the people live. Bolivia gained its independence from Spain about a hundred years ago. It has been slow in developing, but its rich resources promise a better future in it.	"[""almost the same as their ancestors'""]"
What's the writer's attitude?	"With the average home in the capital selling for 19,548 yuan a square meter in November, a tiny mobile home built by a 24-year-old office worker is creating a stir online. Dai Haifei built the 6-square-meter pad because he could not afford to buy or rent in the capital. Dai's new home costs him 6,400 yuan and he has been living in it for nearly two months in a courtyard at Chengfu Road, Haidian district. Dai, who is one of the millions of migrants who moved to the capital from other parts of China seeking a better life and better job, said he realized his financial burden had become too great. The Hunan native said he simply could not make ends meet when he became an intern at a Beijing-based construction design company in 2009. ""I rented a home at the very beginning--a small room in an apartment that cost me about 900 yuan per month,"" said Dai in an interview with local media. ""It was too expensive for me."" Dai's father works on a construction site in his hometown and his mother is a cleaner. Dai, who ended up becoming a formal employee of the company, figured out his own way to solve the problem---with inspiration from a housing design project at his company's exhibition early this year. The project, named ""An egg given birth to by the city"", included a series of egg-like movable houses, with a karaoke house, chair house and trader's house in it. Dai, who borrowed 6,400 yuan from an older cousin and who got additional help from several friends, decided to make one of his own. He spent nearly two months building his ""egg house"" in his hometown, a village in southeast Hunan that is around 1, 700 kilometers from Beijing."	['Objective.']
From the story we know _ .	"Once there was a man and a woman. They had been married for more than 60 years. They kept no secrets from each other except that the old woman had a shoe box under her bed. She told her husband never to open or ask about it. For all these years, he had never thought about the box. But one day the old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would never get better. The woman said it was time that he should know what was in the box. The old man took the shoe box to his wife's bedside. When he opened it, he found two beautiful doilies and some money. The money was $25,000. ""When we got married, ""she said, ""my grandmother told me that the secret of a happy family was never to fight. She told me if every time I got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet one doily."" The old man was so moved because only two doilies were in the box. He thought she had only been angry with him twice in all those years. ""My dear,"" he said, ""but what about all the money? Where did it all come from?"" ""Oh,"" she said, ""that's the money I made from selling the doilies. So far, I have sold 2,500 doilies."""	['the old man was moved when he saw only two doilies in the box']
From the passage, we can see that Takara Co. Ltd. is _ the sale of its new product.	"A Japanese toy maker declares that they have developed a gadget that translates dog barks into human language and plans to begin selling the gadget----under the name of Bowlingual----in U. S. pet stores and gift shops this summer. Tokyo-based Takara Co. Ltd. says about 300, 000 of the dog translator gadgets have been sold since it was on sale in Japan late last year. It is forecasting far bigger sales once an English language translation for dogs comes to America in August. The United States is home to about 67 million dogs, more than six times the number in Japan. ""We know that the Americans love their dogs so much, so we don't think they will mind spending $ 120 on this product, "" the Takara marketing manager said during an interview at a recent pet products conference in Atlanta. Regarded as one of the coolest inventions of 2002 by Time magazine, Bowlingual is made up of a 3 - inch long wireless microphone that is fastened to a dog collar and sends out sounds to a small console that is connected to a database . The console divides each bark into six emotional types----happiness, sadness, disappointment, anger, threat and desire----and shows common phrases, such as ""You're ticking me off,"" that fit the dog's emotional state. Takara says it has spent millions of dollars developing the gadget in cooperation with famous sound experts and animal behaviorists. One thing that does appear certain is that the markets for animal translation products will likely remain a dog's world since Takara has no plans to develop a similar gadget for cats. "" _ are too unpredictable , "" the marketing manager said."	['confident of']
According to the passage, a multi-function watch can _ .	"In today's world of cell phones, mini laptops and MP5 players, most people have at least one time-telling tool with them. Since these devices are so common, is time running out for the 500-year-old watch? According to some consumers, yes. New Jersey teenager Charlie Wollman says a watch is ""an extra piece of equipment with no necessary function"". Many young adults agree and use their cell phones to tell time. It is said that fewer young people wear watches today than five years ago. As a result, some people claim that the watch industry is at a crossroads. However, watchmakers optimistically say that watches _ popularity when consumers reach their 20s and 30s. By then, they are willing to spend money on a quality watch that doesn't just keep good time. Fifty years ago, watchmakers boasted about their products' accuracy. But in recent years, the watch industry has transformed itself into an accessory business. And for many today, the image a watch communicates has become more important than the time it tells. ""Complications"" --- features that go beyond simple timekeeping--- are an important part of a watch's image. Today's watches offer lots of features that meet almost any personality. These features include compasses, lunar calendars, USB drives, and even devices that measure the effectiveness of golf swings ! Creativity is also a key element in today's watches. For example, Japanese watchmaker Tokyoflash makes watches that don't even look like watches. The company's popular Shinshoku model uses different color lights to tell the time. It looks more like a fashionable bracelet than a watch. Whether a watch communicates fashion sense, creative flair or a love of sports, consumers want their timepieces to stand out. Nowadays, everyone has the same kind of gadget in their bags, so people want to make a statement with what's on their wrists. Will this interest in wrist fashion last? Only time will tell!"

Which words can best describe Zuckerberg?	"Born in the State of New York on May 14th, 1984, Mark Zuckerberg was an instant success. In his high school years, he was considered one of top students in the classics, before moving into the arts, sciences, and literature, again picking up high marks and receiving academic praise. It earned him admission to Harvard University. As a rebellious yet relatively quiet student, he created a website called Facemash in the university- an instantly controversial website that encouraged students to rate each other based on appearance. The site was controversial for several reasons. The first was its illegal use of photographs, which the university and students took issue with. The second was its controversial nature - not every student like being ranked based on their appearance. The third was its huge resource use - while it was hosted on Harvard servers, it was the most popular page in the university's entire network. Zuckerberg was soon forced to shut the site down, but its popularity and controversy had made him consider its future potential. He soon turned the simple site into a personal one for Harvard students, encouraging them to network with their peers at the college. It was then, together with his two friends, that they launched ""The Facebook"", which immediately spread to other colleges and grew into a public service that anyone could access in the United States, whether to network with friends and family, or to play games. The company has been criticized frequently, nevertheless, Zuckerberg has remained true to his initial vision - to create a website that the entire world can use to communicate openly and easily with one another and to keep the user experience clean and pure. The end result is one of the world's biggest online businesses. Although its true value is debatable, it's safe to say that Facebook, and its creator Mark Zuckerberg, are two of the twenty-first century's most influential, controversial, and potentially powerful figures."

What did Renee regularly do on the weekend?	"Renee had been married for a long, long time. Her favorite part of being married was the weekend, when she was with her two horses. On the weekend, Renee was at the stables from morning until dark. She fed, groomed, and rode her horses. She was an excellent rider. She would ride the horses bareback on Saturday, and then she would saddle them up on Sunday. Renee loved parades. She used to say, ""A parade isn't a parade without a horse."" Renee loved parades almost as much as she loved her horses. She belonged to an email list of volunteers for parades. She regularly visited the state website list of parades to see if there were any new parades that she didn't know about. All the state parades were organized in her computer. In the parades file, she listed the date, drive time and distance, parade time, contact people, and other details she felt were important. She knew the parade director of every town within a four-hour drive. She never stayed overnight. She always left the parade in time to get her horses back to the stables before ""bedtime"". She had to feed them before they turned in. Her horses seemed to like parades, too. They knew a few tricks that always impressed the children. Renee was very generous with her time and her horses. But owning horses wasn't cheap. You had to rent the stables, and there were always vet and feed bills. Renee knew how to cope with expenses, though. Her vet always gave her a 10-percent discount for paying cash. She always bought the no-name, generic food for the horses. Her vet had told her it was just as healthful and tasty as the brand name material. She always bought economy gasoline. And on parade days, Renee always packed her own lunch and ate with her horses."

It can be learned that the glass reef _ .	"Imagine living in a city made of glass. No, this isn't a fairy tale. If you could grab your diving gear and swim down 650 feet into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Washington State, you would witness the secret world of glass reefs. The reef you'd be looking at is made up of glass sponges . But how can animals be made of glass? Well, glass is formed from a substance called silica. The sponges use the silica found in ocean waters to build glass structures that will give them shape and support. Be careful! Some of the fragile creatures are up to 200 years old. When sponges die, new ones grow on top of the pile of old ones. Over centuries, a massive and complex reef takes shape. Some sponges look like wrinkled trumpets, while others look like overgrown cauliflower or mushrooms. Dr. Paul Johnson, who discovered the Washington reef in 2007, also found other surprises such as bubbles of methane gas flowing out of the seafloor nearby. The methane feeds bacteria, and the bacteria feed the glass sponges. ""It's a new ecosystem we know nothing about,"" said Dr. Johnson. The reef of yellow and orange glass sponges is crowded with crabs, shrimp, starfish, worms, snails, and rockfish. The glass reef is also a nursery for the babies of many of these creatures and was called a ""kindergarten"" by scientists. Many animals that live in the reef hang around for a long time, just like the sponges. Rockfish, for example, live for more than 100 years. Scientists are just beginning to study all the species that call the reef home. The Washington coast isn't the only place where a living glass reef has been found. The first was discovered in Hecate Strait off the coast of British Columbia in 1991. Scientists all over the world were to see it."	['is a new ecosystem people are not familiar with']

The author's experience mainly shows that _ .	Stubbornness(,) can push a business to hold on but can also kill your business if it keeps stopping you. Because I'm stubborn. I chased my dream of creating a pet-food company that sells what it claims to sell and not some unidentifiable substance in a dressed-up bag. Originally we packed our foods in transparent bags, which became our guiding philosophy. To start the company in 2003, I visited every pet-food store in Manhattan and some outside the city. By 2006 Stella&Chewy's was sold in 250 stores, mostly in New York City. In 2007 I moved the company to Wisconsin, with our earnings reaching almost $500,000 that year.But getting my product into stores was just the beginning. We were competing against much bigger pet-food companies whose monthly marketing budgets were more than our yearly sales. So we invested in advertisements and a website and even stood on sidewalks giving our samples. With more customers came more feedback , much of which I ignored, I was also receiving complaints about ice crystals on the food, which form when the air temperature changes during transport. For this reason, most frozen foods are packaged in opaque bags or boxes. Studies have proved that ice crystals have little effect on either the quality or the taste of the food. So I ignored the complaints. After all, we were better than our competitors that wouldn't even show their products. We didn't hide anything. In 2007 our sales kept growing, but not as fast as those of our competitors. We were told that new consumers were choosing products packaged in opaque bags. When I visited the stores and forced myself to consider my products objectively, I had to degree: The ice crystals reduced the look I wanted. The food looked as if a snowstorm had hit the inside of the bag. We switched to opaque bags and tried to make ice crystals smaller. Customers responded: In 2009 Stella$Chewy's was sold in 2,500 stores across the country.	['stubbornness can make people succeed or fail']

How did Reuben manage to raise the 20 cents short for his purchase?	"In 1945, a 12-year-old boy saw something in a shop window that set his heart racing. But the price-five dollars-was far beyond Reuben Earle's means. Five dollars would buy almost a week's groceries for his family. Reuben couldn't ask his father for the money. Everything his father made through fishing went to her mother, Dora, who struggled to feed and clothe their five children. Nevertheless, he opened the shop's weathered door and went inside. Standing proud and straight in his flour-sack shirt and washed-out trousers, he told the shopkeeper what he wanted, adding ,""But I don't have the money right now. Can you please hold it for me for some time?"" ""I'll try,""the shopkeeper smiled.""Folks around here don't usually have that kind of money to spend on things. It should keep for a while."" Reuben respectfully touched his worn cap and walked out. He would raise the money and not tell anybody. On hearing the sound of hammering from a side street, Reuben suddenly had an idea. People built their own homes in Bay Roberts, using nails purchased in sacks from a local factory. Sometimes the used sacks were disposed of at the construction site, and Reuben knew he could sell them back to the factory for five cents a piece. That day he found two sacks, which he sold to the man in charge of packing nails. The boy's hand tightly clutched the five-cent pieces as he ran the two kilometers home. Near his house stood an ancient barn. Reuben found a rusty soda tin and dropped his coins inside. Then he climbed into it and hid the tin beneath a pile of hay. It was dinnertime when Reuben got home. His father was ready to serve dinner as Reuben took his place at the table. He looked at his mother and smiled. Slim and beautiful, she was the center of the home, the glue that held it together. Her chores were never-ending, but she was happy as her family and their well-being were her highest priority. Every day after chores and school, Reuben _ the town, collecting the nail sacks. Summer vacation came, and no student was more delighted than Reuben. Now he would have more time for his mission. All summer long, despite chores at home weeding and watering the garden, cutting wood and fetching water -- Reuben kept to his secret task. Then all too soon fall arrived, and the winds blew cold and gusty from the bay. Reuben wandered the streets, diligently searching for his treasures. Often he was cold, tired and hungry, but the thought of the object in the shop window sustained him. Sometimes his mother would ask:""Reuben, where were you? We were waiting for you to have dinner."" ""Playing, Mum. Sorry."" Dora would look at his face and shake her head. Boys. Finally the time had come! He ran into the barn, climbed to the hayloft and uncovered the tin can. He poured the coins out and began to count. Then he counted again. He needed 20 cents more. Could there be any sacks left anywhere in town? He had to find out and sell them before the day ended. Reuben ran down Water Street. The shadows were lengthening when Reuben arrived at the factory. The sack buyer was about to lock up. ""Mister! Please don't close up yet."" The man turned and saw Reuben, dirty and sweat stained. ""Come back tomorrow, boy."" ""Please, Mister. I have to sell the sacks now -- please.""The man heard a tremor in Reuben's voice and could tell he was close to tears. ""Why do you need this money so badly?"" ""It's a secret."" The man took the sacks, reached into his pocket and put four coins in Reuben's hand. Reuben murmured a thank you and ran home. Then, clutching the tin can, he headed for the shop. ""I have the money,""he solemnly told the owner. The man went to the window and retrieved Reuben's treasure. He wiped the dust off and gently wrapped it in brown paper. Then he placed the parcel in Reuben's hands. Racing home, Reuben burst through the front door. His mother was busy in the kitchen. ""Here, Mum! Here!""Reuben exclaimed as he ran to her side. He placed a small box in her work-roughened hand. She unwrapped it carefully, to save the paper. A blue-velvet jewel box appeared. Dora lifted the lid, tears beginning to blur her vision. In gold lettering on a small, almond-shaped brooch was the word ""Mother"". It was Mother's Day, 1946. Dora had never received such a gift; she had no finery except her wedding ring. Speechless, she smiled radiantly and gathered her son into her arms."	['By sweating himself in collecting and selling more sacks.']

Would one of you mind doing this for me, please?"" His mother and sisters were busy and they said nothing. But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went quietly upstairs to her son's bedroom and shortened the trousers by two inches. She came downstairs without saying anything to her daughters. Later on, after supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She was a kind-hearted girl, so she went quietly upstairs without saying anything to anyone and shortened the trousers by two inches. The younger sister went to the cinema, but when she came back, she, too, remembered what her brother had said. So she ran upstairs and took two inches off the legs of the new trousers."

The text is mainly to _ .	"Dogs and cats are not for students who live in the dormitory. Just think about the noise, the smell and all that wild behavior--chewing on whatever they can get their teeth on, or knocking over the trash can. But don't feel sad. There are smaller and less destructive pets to make your dormitory life colorful. Betta fish They make great pets with their big personality and astonishing colors, ranging from bright red, dark blue to lemon yellow. Unlike many fish, most bettas react to their owner's presence and become more active when they are nearby, which is unusual in the fish world. Chinchillas Without bad smell, about the size of a rabbit and with fur so dense that they can't get pests such as fleas , the friendly creature originally from the Andes Mountains in South America makes an ideal indoor pet. Chinchillas are very social animals, so if you only have one, you will become its family. In cold winter days, in a glance at this fury pet in a dorm will bring you a lot of warmth. Land hermit crabs In a society where owners are often asked ""Are they tasty?"", land hermit crabs are among the most unlucky animals commonly kept as pets. But they are easy to care for, inexpensive and fascinating to watch. And the fact that they don't cause any allergic reactions makes them perfect for college dormitories. Red-eared sliders If you're interested in a lifelong friend, a red-eared slider makes a wonderful pet. If well cared for, they can live for around 40 years. But there are a couple of things you should know. Red-eared can grow to an adult size of up to 30cm! So you may need a larger tank quickly. In addition, you will need to provide UV lighting, water heater, and a swimming area and a basking area. Housing a red eared slider is not easy."	['recommend some dormitory pets']

For how long was Benin an independent state before it became a People's Republic?	Benin is one of the smallest African states. It lies in West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea, to the south of Burkina Faso and Niger, between Togo on the west and Nigeria on the east. Benin used to be called Dahomey and was controlled and ruled by France from 1893 to 1960, when it became independent. In 1963 the army general Soglo overthrew the first president Maga. Soglo set up an army government and called himself head of state in 1965, but was overthrown and replaced by a civilian government in 1967. In December 1969 Benin had another change of power with the army again taking over. In May 1970, Maga and two other men set up a new government, with each of them acting as president in turn for two years. However, half a year after Maga turned over power to the second man Ahomadegbe, the three-man government was overthrown by the army once more and General Kerekou became president. In November 1975 Kerekou changed the name of the nation from Dahomey to Benin, Benin being the name of a 17th century kingdom covering the same place. Kerekou also announced that Benin would be a People's Republic based on Marxism-Leninism.	['15 years.']
Why did Sue come up to the instructor's family ?	"One day in Australia I decided to try hang gliding .

In response Sue exclaimed ,sounding surprised , ""Not good ?I bet it is fun."" Then she turned her attention back to the boy's parents. They started talking about some of their friends, smiling and laughing . Meanwhile, all three of them completely ignored the boy . But I watched his head drop.I watched him turn away from the group, take a few steps ,and just stand there ,alone. I still find it hard to believe that anyone could miss a child's reaction that completely. I wondered how the three adults could stand there and laugh while that boy stood there alone, troubled not only about school but also that no one was interested in his troubles. Maybe his father tried to distract his son with risky sports. As long as you are active, you can't feel your emotional pain. But what if his son is not interested in sports? These were what most people would say are ""good parents"" . But I say that what they did was child abuse. It was total emotional neglect at that moment . And that is why I am writing this story.

For what purpose did Nest create the Protect Smoke Alarm?	"The PS109 Nest Protect Smoke Alarm promises Internet alerts and an end to the low battery chirp . Besides, it uses a voice to tell you where the fire is. The alarm is the first UK product from Nest, which is run by iPod-inventor Tony Fadell. The company claims the device's batteries will last for up to seven years. The device will offer a spoken warning before it sounds a major alarm. Also it will use text messages and apps on your phones to alert users to low-level risks. The present smoke alarms constantly alert users to non-existent threats, which will make many users annoyed and finally remove their batteries altogether. ""We've all experienced the smoke alarm going off while we're cooking. Sometimes, we need to search for the source of that non-stop low-battery chirp at midnight,"" said Fadell. ""Therefore, every time a smoke alarm cries wolf, we trust it a little less, and then -- in a moment of frustration -- we take the batteries out to stop the beep . And that leaves us and our families at risk."" If the Protect smoke alarms are used, they can be set up in up to ten zones, so that the clear warnings tell users where the risk has been detected. ""Safety shouldn't be annoying,"" said Matt Rogers, Nest founder and vice president of engineering. ""It was unacceptable to us that one in eight houses in the UK has a non-functioning smoke alarm. These products are required by law and are supposed to keep us safe, yet people hate them. We wanted to change that."""	['To improve present smoke alarms.']
What can be a suitable title for the passage?	We all have ideas about what kinds of foods are good or bad to eat. As a result, people from one culture often think the foods that people from another culture eat are unacceptable. Many people would find it terrible to eat rats, but there are forty-two different cultures whose people regard rats as proper food. Food likes and dislikes do not always seem related to nutrition. For example, broccoli is first on a list of the most nutritious common vegetables, but it is twenty-first on a list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. Tomatoes are sixteenth on the list of most nutritious vegetables, but they are first on the list of vegetables that Americans like most to eat. But dislikes is not the only reason why some cultures will not eat a certain food. In some cultures, certain foods are taboo. Taboo is a word from the language of the Fiji Islands that is used to describe something that is forbidden. We do not usually think about why certain things are taboo in our culture. One example is that Americans do not eat dogs, although people from some other cultures regard them as good food. In the United States, dogs are very important to people as pets. They are usually regarded as part of the family, almost like a child in some cases. In addition, dogs have value as protection against criminals . Actually, the dog's place in society as a companion makes the dog taboo as food. Scientists believe that most food likes and dislikes are a result of the ways of life of different people. People will not eat pets such as dogs. Americans eat a lot of beef because there is plenty of land for raising cattle and their meat can be shipped cheaply for long distances by railroads.

What is the purpose of the passage?	"Most people report that they do not usually feel confident. But exciting things can happen when we actually believe in ourselves. Here is a man who believed in his own ability even as a boy, and that confidence helped shape his adult life. At the turn of the last century, a young boy quit school to help with the family expenses. When he was fifteen, he became interested in automobiles and worked in a garage. He subscribed to a correspondence home study course on automobiles and, after a long day in the garage, studied at the kitchen table by lamplight. When he felt ready, he walked into the Frayer-Miller Automobile Company of Columbus, Ohio. When Mr. Frayer noticed him, he asked, ""Well, what do you want?"" ""I just thought I'd tell you I'm coming to work here tomorrow morning,"" the boy replied. ""Oh! Who hired you?"" ""Nobody yet, but I'll be on the job in the morning. If I'm not worth anything, you can fire me."" Early the next morning the young man returned to the plant. Noticing the floor was thick with metal shavings and accumulated dirt, the boy got a broom and set out to clean the place. Because of his self-confidence and work ethic, the boy's future was predictable. He went on to stand out in many fields, including automobile racing, piloting World War I planes and founding what was to become one of America's largest airline companies -- Eastern Airlines. People who become more confident habitually encourage themselves. Without confidence, we are not likely to move far in the direction of our dreams. But become our own best friend and almost anything will be possible. It is important that we always believe in ourselves. In order to reach victory, we must believe in ourselves even when we make mistakes and fall short."	['To inspire us with self-confidence.']
From the passage,we can infer that_would produce the LEAST heat.	"No matter what he is doing,every human being gives body heat.The usual problem is how to _ it.But the designers of the Johnstown campus of the university of Pittsburg set themselves the opposite problem--how to collect body heat.They have designed a collection system which uses not only body heat but also the heat given off by such objects as light bulbs and refrigerators as well.The system works so well that no conventional fuel is needed to make the campus's six buildings comfortable. Some parts of most modern buildings--theatres and offices as well as classrooms-are more than heated by people and lights and sometimes must be air-conditioned even in the winter.The technique of saving and redistributing it is called ""heat recovery"".A few modern buildings recover heat,but the university's system is the first to recover heat from some buildings and reuse it in others. Along the way,Pitt has learned a great deal about some of its heat producers.The harder a student studies,the more heat his body gives off.Male students emit more heat than female students,and the larger a student,the more heat he produces.It is tempting to conclude that the hottest prospect for the Johnstown campus would be a hard-working,overweight male genius."

What is the new inhaler?	"Air pollution, such as haze, has become a serious problem around the world. Besides wearing a mask, what else can we do to protect ourselves from the dirty air? Scientists have developed a new inhaler that can reduce the effect air pollution has on people. It could help millions of people who are suffering from air pollution,the Guardianreports. This inhaler is developed by German company Bitop and contains a molecule named Ectoine. The molecule creates a layer that protects lungs from polluted air. It's reported that the inhaler will be affordable to most people when it comes to the market. Air pollution kills more than three million people a year worldwide and leads to health problems like lung and heart disease and strokes, according to a 2016 research project in the journalNature. It is also linked to brain disease, mental illness and diabetes . Andreas Bilstein at Bitop believed that the inhaler could be useful around the world, because air pollution is not just a European problem: ""Especially in Asia - China in particular - the demand for such a product is even higher."" Many Chinese cities have been suffering from haze. According to World Health Organization, two of the 10 most polluted cities in the world in 2015 were in China. About 800,000 deaths that are linked to air pollution take place in the country every year. However, such inhalers should never be an excuse for not trying to stop air pollution, said Professor Jean Krutmann at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine. ""The best thing is that we have clean air and we don't need any prophylactic treatment,"" he said."	['It can help us reduce the harm of air pollution.']
Hans went to London by _ .	"Hans said to his friend Kurt, ""I'm going to take my car to drive to London."" Kurt said, ""Driving to London is very hard. You aren't going to find your hotel."" But Hans was not afraid. He drove to Calais, put his car on the ship, took it off at Dover, and drove to London. He stopped near the city and looked at his map. Then he drove into London, but he did not find his hotel. He drove round and round for an hour, and then he stopped and got out of his car. A taxi came, and Hans stopped it. ""Take me to the Brussels Hotel,"" he said. But he did not get into the taxi: he got back into his car. The taxi man laughed, but then he drove to the Brussels Hotel, and Hans followed him in his car. They reached the hotel in two minutes. ,."	['both sea and land']
The aim of the Law for the Encouragement of Marriage was to _ .	Women in Nazi Germany were to have a very special job. Hitler was very clear about this. This job was that they should be good mothers bringing up children at home while their husbands worked. Except for some special fields, Hitler saw no reason why a woman should work. Within months of Hitler coming to power, many female doctors, teachers and lawyers were . By the start of the Second World War, very few German women were in fulltime work. From their earliest years, girls were taught that all good German women married at a young age to a proper German and that the wife's job was to keep a good home for her working husband and to have children. One of the earliest laws passed by Hitler once he came to power in 1933, was the Law for the Encouragement of Marriage. This law stated that all newly married couples would get a government loan of 1000 marks. This loan was not to be simply paid back. The birth of one child meant that 25% of the loan did not have to be paid back. Two children meant that 50% of the loan didn't need to be paid back. Four children meant that the entire loan was cleared. What was more, as housewives and mothers, their lives were controlled. Women were not expected to wear make-up or trousers. Only flat shoes were expected to be worn. Women were discouraged from slimming as this was considered bad for child birth.	['encourage couples to have as many children as they could']
Cats usually drink _ .	Many people like animals such as dogs and cats and keep one or more of them as pets. If you keep a dog or a cat as a pet, you must know how to look after it. A grown-up dog needs two meals a day --not more. It can eat meat, fish, rice and some other things. Dogs like large bones , but you can't give them chicken bones. Remember to give them much clean water. A dog should have a clean, dry box for sleeping. Washing it once a week is good for its health. If it is ill, take it to a doctor. A healthy dog will bring you more pleasure. Be careful when you choose a cat. A cat has two meals a day with some meat or fish. It drinks a little milk every day. Sometimes you can give it vegetables to eat. Don't forget that it needs clean water to drink. Take good care of your pets, they will be your good friends. Maybe they can give you some help when you are in need.	['milk and water']

Parakeets are no longer welcome mainly because _ .	For 40 years, the people of London have been happy to discover in their parks a bird that seems to have made its way from the Himalayas to the capital of England. With its shocking green body, red mouth, long tail and noisy screech , the rose-ringed parakeet brought a vivid colour to parks in and around London. However, the parakeets are no longer welcome. The government has suddenly woken up to the fact that there are many more parakeets in and around London making life harder for the local bird population. Government experts put the number of parakeets at around 30,000. They fear that if the number of parakeets keeps rising, these birds will push out local birds like wood-peckers, starlings and nuthatches from trees to build their own nests. Not only that. According to an online report by The Independent, the parakeets will then also get control of most of the food available in the parks -- seeds, berries, fruit and nuts. The local bird population will then have a hard time staying alive. An organization called the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has asked the government to investigate what kind of a threat the parakeet brings to local birds. If the government decides that these birds are indeed a threat to local birds, steps will be taken to control the number of parakeets. The most surprising thing about the case of the rose-ringed parakeet is that no one quite knows how the parakeets came from India and started breeding in areas around London.

The Appalachian Trail _ .	One of the most popular activities enjoyed by Americans is spending time in forests and walking along paths through the country.This activity,called hiking,has led to the creation of paths throughout the United States. One of the longest is the Appalachian National Scenic Trail.The trail is the first completed part of the National Trails System.The trails system was established by Congress and the president in 1968.The Appalachian Trail is more than 3,400 kilometers long.It starts in the northeastern state of Maine and ends in the southeastern state of Georgia.The trail goes through 14 states.They are Maine,New Hampshire,Vermont,Massachusetts,Connecticut,New York,New Jersey,Pennsylvania,Maryland,West Virginia,Virginia,Tennessee,North Carolina,and Georgia. The path takes walkers through the Appalachian Mountains.They extend from the Canadian province of Quebec to the southern American state of Alabama. The Appalachian Mountains are among the oldest on Earth.They first began forming about one thousand million years ago.During the millions of years since then,the mountains were changed and reformed by the forces of water and wind.Ice also changed the mountains,making many of them smaller and digging valleys and lakes among them.Many different kinds of trees grow along the trail.And many different kinds of animals live in the forests along the trail. Lands along the trail are protected by the federal government and by state governments.Some parts are not protected by the government directly.Instead,they are protected by legal agreements with private owners willing to permit people to walk across their property. Walkers on the Appalachian Trail pass through some of the great valley systems of the mountains.They can look down into these beautiful valleys and see farms and forests stretching across the land for many kilometers.Farmland in the valleys is rich and productive.And some of the great events in American history took place in the valleys.For example,one of the great battles of the American Civil War was fought in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia.

The competition is held at the Bridge Inn because _ .	"A disastrous competition is going on in England, with billions of dollars and hundreds of lives in danger. OK, that's not true. But competitors from around the world gathered on Thursday to compete for the title of 2012's World's Biggest Liar. Each participant is given up to five minutes to make up the best lie in the competition, which was started in honor of 19th-century Bridge Inn owner Will Ritson, who was reportedly famous for his lies. Competitors gather at the Bridge Inn every year for the competition, a small pub in northwestern England. Anyone can take part in the competition. Well, almost anyway; the reporters note that lawyers and politicians are banned, who is said to enjoy ""an unfair advantage"" in the proceedings . A study published this past July in the journal Evolution & Human Behavior found that nearly all lies are detectable through visible facial muscle reactions in the person telling a lie. ""Thus, while interpersonal deception often is highly successful, signs of hidden emotional states are communicated clearly to the informed observer,"" the study concluded. A churchman of Carlisle reportedly holds what may be the greatest lie of all time in the competition, simply stating, ""I have never told a lie in my life."" In 2003, Abrie Krueger of South Africa became the first non-Brit to win the competition. Ironically, Krueger was accused by some of cheating. In 2006, comedian Sue Perkins became the first female to win the competition, telling a tale about people riding camels to work as a result of climate change. Last year's winning entry came from Glen Boyland, who told a lie about competing in a snail-racing competition with Prince Charles."	['it once had a good liar as its owner']
The author first danced with Dar when _ .	"Dar and I loved to dance. It was probably the first thing we did together, long before we would share our lives. We grew up in a small Oregon mountain community where dances were held almost every Saturday night. Dar was seventeen and l was thirteen when we first danced. He was one of the best dancers on the floor, and so was I. We always jitterbugged. No slow dancing for us; nothing remotely romantic. Our fathers would stand along the wall and watch. Every once in a while, Dar's dad would smile a little and say, to no one in particular, but my dad could hear, ""Boy, my kid can sure dance."" _ he acted like he'd never heard. But a while later he would say, to no one in particular, ""That girl of mine can sure dance."" Our dancing together stopped for five years while Dar was in the South Pacific in World War II. When we met again, Dar was twenty-two, and l was eighteen. We began to date and dance again. We were as good together as we remembered, and this time we added slow dancing. For us, life is a dance, a movement of rhythms, directions, stumbles, missteps, at times slow and precise, or fast and wild and joyous. We did all the steps. Two nights before Dar died, the family were with us. We all ate dinner together, and Dar sat with us. He hadn't been able to eat for several days. After dinner, I put on a Nat King Cole tape. Dar took me in his arms, weak as he was, and we danced and smiled. No tears for us. We were doing what we had loved to do for more than fifty years. It was our last dance---forever unforgettable. I wouldn't have missed it for the world."	['they were still in their teens']
The writer wants to tell us _ in the passage.	"One day, a boy had a fight with one of his classmates. He didn't wait until school was over, and hurried home to his grandfather. He told him his story angrily. ""He is really bad,"" the boy said, ""and I hate him."" The grandfather said, ""Let me tell you a story. When I was a boy, I, too, sometimes hated others for what they did..."" As the boy listened carefully, the grandfather went on,""There are always two tigers inside my heart. One is good and kind. He gets on well with everything around him. But the other is bad and unfriendly. Even the smallest thing will make him angry. He fights with everyone all the time, and for no reason. He can't think carefully because he always hates others. It is difficult to live with these two tigers inside my heart. They both try to control me."" The boy looked into his grandfather's eyes and asked,""Which tiger always controls you, Grandfather?"" The old man said slowly and seriously, ""The one that I feed. I always feed the good and kind tiger, so I never hate others and seldom get angry now."" ,."	['how to control our feelings']
According to that Bangladesh military officer, _ .	"I grew up in Lakeland, Louisiana, one of 7 children. We all lived on my parents' farm. At 12, I got a part-time job--milking cows to help support the family. I milked cows at five in the morning and again at two in the afternoon, seven days a week. In the kitchen one Saturday before daytime, I remember complaining to my father and grandfather about having to go milk those cows. My father said, ""You know, boy, to work is a blessing ."" Going to college was rare for a kid from Lakeland, Louisiana. ""Pick something that you like doing to study, and you will always look forward to your work,"" my father told me. But he also added, ""Even having a job you hate is better than not having a job at all."" I wanted to be a farmer, but I joined the ROTC program to help pay for college. And what started out as an obligation to the army became a way of life that I was devoted to for 37 years. In the late 1980s, during a visit to Bangladesh, I saw a woman with a baby on her back, breaking bricks with a hammer. I asked a Bangladesh military officer why they weren't using a machine. He told me a machine would make that lady unemployed . Breaking those bricks meant she could earn enough money to feed herself and her baby that day. He told me bad as that woman's job was, it was enough to keep a small family alive, which reminded me of my father's words. I'm retired from the army, but I'm still working to help people be prepared for disaster. I'm not going to stop. I believe in my father's words. I believe in the blessing of work."

What are the main factors that influence the distribution of people?	You may have noticed that the world's population is not evenly distributed around our planet. There are some countries where people seem to be living nearly _ each other because conditions are overcrowded. Then there are others where it seems that hardly anybody lives. What influences this unequal distribution of people? There are specific advantages and disadvantages of *diving in a certain area. The two main factors that influence people`s choice of location are climate and resources. Climate is the usual weather conditions in a region. Areas that have bad weather are generally less deal as places to live in. The north and south poles at the top and bottom of the world may be beautiful in their rugged, natural way, but the disadvantage of the bitterly cold and windy conditions usually keeps people away. When it comes to climate, warm conditions and a normal amount of rainfall are advantages that attract people. Natural resources are things that we get from nature that help us survive. Each region offers different resources, and therefore attracts different groups of people. People who enjoy the beach can make their living by catching and selling the ocean's many fish and other sea creatures. Those who prefer farming can take advantage of rich soil in valleys near rivers. Some people are willing to accept the disadvantages of the terrible conditions of deserts or mountains in order to take advantage of the resources like oil or woods.	['Climate and resources.']
Which of the following is WRONG according to the passage?	Today is my first day at Merchiston Castle School,and I was really nervous about it, because I have never visited the school before and didn't take any summer course. Despite my anxiety,I soon relaxed once I arrived; the staff were so nice that I felt my spoken English was better than it actually was! As soon as I walked into the dayroom of my boarding house,I was absolutely amazed by the friendly atmosphere; everyone was so friendly that a boy as shy as I had no difficulty in setting in,and I made many new friends on my very first day,although I was struggling to remember all the names. Also I realized there were other international students in the house from all over the world,such as South Korea,Japan and Russia.Although their English was not so fluent,it didn't take long for us to understand each other at all.In some ways,it was even better to practice Enlgish by speaking to the international students,because we were both learning. As a boarder,the quality of food is something I consider very important,and Merchiston has not let me down.The school kitchens are run by a professional catering company,and the quality of food is excellent,also they take the issue of a healthy diet really seriously.I remember once I was asked to take more salad for my meal by a member of the kitchen staff for I did not have enough vegetables.This brings to another point of being a boarder:you need to learn how to look after yourself and be responsible for yourself.One of the huge advantages of being a _ is that we can have breakfast in the school,which means we don't have to pull ourselves out of the bed as early as the daypupils!

What do we know about golf from the passage?	"Sports can help you keep fit and get in touch with nature.However,whether you are on the mountains,in the waves,or on the grassland,you should be aware that your sport of choice might have great influence on the environment. Some sports are resource-hungry.Golf,as you may know,eats up not only large areas of countryside,but also tons of water.Besides,all sorts of chemicals and huge amounts of energy are used to keep its courses in good condition.This causes major environmental effects.For example,in the dry regions of Portugal and Spain,golf is often held responsible for serious water shortage in some local areas. There are many environment-friendly sports.Power walking is one of them that you could take up today.You don't need any special equipment except a good pair of shoes;and you don't have to worry about resources and your purse.Simple and free,power walking can also keep you fit.If you walk regularly,it will be good for your heart and bones.Experts say that 20 minutes of power walking daily can make you feel less anxious,sleep well and have better weight control. Whatever sport you take up,you can make it greener by using environment-friendly equipment and buying products made from recycled materials.But the final goal should be""green gyms"".They RYe better replacements for traditional health clubs and modern sports centers. Members of green gyms play sports outdoors,in the countryside or other open spaces.There is no special requirement for you to start your membership.And best of all,it's free."

The passage is written for _ .	"Your daughter has finally reached the age of 18, and you think perhaps your job will finally get a little easier. That could be wrong thinking - as the parent of any 18-year-old will tell you. Learning to _ an ungrateful 18-year-old daughter takes patience, understanding and time. _ When she was a little girl, she wanted you to be involved in everything of her life from her daily activities to her friends. This is' no longer the case. She's a grown woman who needs her own personal life. Comment on her choices only when asked to do so - especially if you want to say no to her. Allow her to make mistakes. No parent wants to see his or her child fall, but the days of protecting her all the time are at an end. Unless you see a train coming, let her fall when she makes poor choices. It will enable her to grow past the ungrateful ""know it all"" stage. Encourage dialogue whenever you can, rather than planning talks. She's more likely to open up to you when talking over something trivial . Anytime she wants to talk, become a willing listener in the conversation. You never know when a deeper, more important conversation will develop."	['parents']
How does Feng Huan come home from school?	Feng Huan was born in a far village in Jiangxi Province. She is 13 years old, but she is only as tall as a six-year-old girl. She is an unlucky child. Born with an illness,she can't walk as others. Family elders once tried to abandon her because of her poor health, but her mother never gave up. She named her Feng Huan, which means happiness, hoping her daughter would grow up to have a happy life in the future. The illness brought so much pain to Feng Huan over the years. Her legs have become deformed as she has been unable to walk since she was born. She could hardly walk or go to the washroom without help. What's worse, her illness is getting worse and worse, which puts pressure on one of her kidneys . Her mother has taken her to Shanghai to see a doctor, and her parents have done everything they could to treat her illness. Thanks to great love from her mother, Feng Huan is able to go to school as other children. She says she loves school because she can learn many things there and chat with her classmates. After she goes home on her mother's back from school, she does her homework with her favorite doll by her side. She takes the doll everywhere with her, even when she sleeps. Luckily, when her story is reported, many kind-hearted people have lent helping hands. Feng Huan is now r _ after corrective surgery on her legs in Shenzheng, Guangdong Province.

What Linda has said suggests _ .	"Companies trying to market products to mothers need to head onto the Internet with a survey showing the mothers today are online daily, using Facebook to connect to friends and Google to diagnose illnesses. A survey by parenting website BabyCenter.corn found 63% of online mothers now use social media networks such as Facebook regularly, compared to only 11% three years ago.""They don't watch TV as much, they are not reading magazines as much, but instead they check Facebook where people are really drawn together over parenting questions,"" BabyCenter's Editor-in-Chief Linda said.""One of the major activities is looking for comments on products.They are information seeking, particularly when it comes to babies, and companies need to realize this."" Companies also need to know their market well as mothers are sharing information--and complaints--online regularly. A drug company learned the hard way last November when online mothers found an ad targeting moms to be offensivedl , which result in a hot debate on the micro-blogging site Twitter.The company had to take the video ad down from its website and apologized for any offense caused. The online survey also found that mothers aren't going to the doctor as often.Instead they are using the Internet to find out what is wrong with their children and, when they do go to the doctor, asking which drug they should use rather than for a diagnosis.In online communities children's health issues are the leading topic of interest rating as high as 91 percent followed by childhood development tips at 79 percent and product reviews at 72 percent."

How has the author organized the article?	"Bluebirds looking secretly from nest boxes. Tadpoles swimming in a pond. Tiger swallowtails flying quickly around a butterfly bush. And over here, a class of students watching it all. A field trip to a nature center? No, it's a schoolyard. With some work on your part, it could even be your schoolyard. Interested in building a schoolyard habitat? Here's how to get started. Gather a Team Students can do a lot on their own, but you'll need adults for a project this big. Get teachers, parents, and even the headmaster interested. Don't forget the maintenance staff--they know more about your school's yard than anyone else and can give you lots of help. Also, ask around your neighborhood for gardeners, naturalists, and others willing to give advice. Map Your Site Which part of the schoolyard can you turn into a habitat? Is there an unused corner of the playground? Part of a lawn or field you could let go wild? You'll need to make a map of the area showing what's there now. Then you can figure out how you want to change it. For that, you need a plan. Plan a Habitat Here's what you'll need to make your area attractive to wildlife. Food: Plant flowers, bushes, and trees. These provide seeds, berries, leaves, flowers, and sweet liquids. And all of these feed birds, and insects. You can also add some feeders for squirrels and birds. Where possible, stick with native plants--wild plants that grow naturally in your area. They need less care, which means less work for you. Water: A small pond, birdbath, or even a shallow dish of clean water in the ground will attract birds. Other small animals like insects may visit as well. Shelter: Bushes and trees make great escapes for birds. Tall grass and ""weeds"" are home to grasshoppers, garter snakes, and some ground-nesting birds. You can also add stone piles and brush piles. Places to Raise Young: Butterflies need special plants to lay their eggs on. Frogs and toads lay eggs only in shallow water. Many birds use birdhouses; others nest in trees and bushes. In fact, nearly all your shelters may become homes for wild young. Put It on Paper Using the map you made of your area, draw in the changes you want to make. Mark where the plants, nest boxes, and other items will go. Remember, this is a long-term plan--you don't have to do everything this spring. Maybe you could put up a few birdhouses and plant some butterfly bushes now and save the trees and bushes for next year. Even a small start is a big step for wildlife. Reach for Resources To make the habitat happen, you'll need lots of plants, seeds, and other supplies. You'll also need to buy or borrow tools and maybe even some heavy equipment. Now's the time to reach out for donations. Start by asking your parent-teacher organization. Then go to garden clubs, garden stores (they might give you a discount), local government agencies, and businesses. If they can't donate supplies or money, ask if they can donate workers! The workers can help build the habitat. You'll also need people to help maintain it. Some schools ask their students' families to take turns during the summer. Each family maintains the habitat for a couple of weeks. Build Your Design Now you can dig in. Set a date, and get growing!"	['By giving step-by-step instructions.']
What is the passage mainly about?	"Colleges may try to do a lot to prepare students for study abroad - telling about culture shock, warning about homesickness, recommending books about the country. But when it comes to adjusting to campus life when they return, schools haven't done as much, even though the transition is sometimes almost as difficult. ""They can feel disoriented and depressed. They find things are not exactly the way they were when they left,"" said Antonio Jimenez, director of the Center for International Affairs at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo, California, US. ""They find that people don't care much about their experiences."" Some colleges are now rethinking their approach to study abroad, recognizing that students might need almost as much help adjusting to life back home as they did getting ready to leave: students experience a sort of reverse culture shock when they return to the US. They might be troubled by the wealth and waste they see back home or they might feel homesick for their new country and its customs. And when they try to talk about their experiences, people quickly lose interest, especially if they haven't lived abroad themselves. Down the road, they also might find it difficult to translate their time abroad into experience that an employer finds attractive. Some California universities have organized conferences to help students make the most of their time abroad. During a one-day event, students learn how to adjust after living abroad, talk about their experiences and incorporate them into their lives and future careers. Blythe Cherney, 22, a senior who has studied in Thailand and Britain, found the _ helpful. ""Any experience abroad does have an effect on you,"" Cherney said. ""When you come back, it's important to talk about it, especially with people who know what you've been through."" Yet most universities focus more on preparation than reorientation. When students return, they might have a welcome home reception. But for the most part, universities figure students can fend for themselves."

The author wrote this article in order to _ .	"Some time people call each other ""scared-cat"",but have you ever thought about this expression? When a cat is frightened,its heart starts beating faster,its muscles get tense,and there are changes in the chemicals in its bloodstream.Although the cat doesn't realize this,its body is getting ready for action.If the danger continues,the animal will do one of two things:It will defend itself,or it will run away as fast as it can. Something like this also happens to people.When we are excited,angry,scared,or aroused by other emotions (feelings),our bodied go through many physical changes.Out hearts beat faster,and our muscled get tense.All of these changes make us more alert and ready to react.We,too get ready to defend ourselves or run. Human beings,however,have a problem that animals never face.If we give way to our feelings and let them take over,we can get into trouble.Have you ever said something in anger--or hit somebody--and regretted it later? Have you ever shouted at a teacher,told somebody you were lonely,or said you were in love,and then wished later you had kept your mouth shut? It isn't always wise to express your feelings freely. Does this mean that it's smarter always to hide our feelings? No! If you keep feelings of anger,sadness,and bitterness hidden away or bottled up inside,your body stays tense.Physical illness can develop,and you can feel _ inside.It can actually be bad for your health.(It isn't good to keep pleasant feelings inside either;all feelings need to be expressed.) Feelings that you keep all bottled up inside don't just go away.It's as if you bought some bananas and stuck them in a cupboard.You might not be able to see them,but before long you'd smell them.And if you opened the cupboard,chances are you'd see little fruit flies hovering all over them.They'd be rotten. You can try to treat emotions as if they were bananas in the cupboard.You can hide them and you can pretend they don't exist,but they'll still be around.And at last you'll have to deal with them,just like those bananas."

What's the main idea of the passage?	"Every time an election rolls around, people want to know what each candidate's stance is on the issues that are important to them. In deciding which candidateIwant to vote for, there are two main issues for me:the economy and education. These issues are important to me because they affect me the most right now. The economy affects everyone,and education is important because I am about to enter college. When I looked at how each candidate views these issues, one man stood out to me,and that is Democratic candidate Barack Obama. I like a11 of Senator Obama's ideas for improving the economy. He wants to bring the troops home from Iraq,thereby saving the $12 billion we spend there every month. Another point that Obama makes is that the United States' current energy policy is hurting the economy. He believes that if new energy bills are passed, it will help the U. S. get out of its current economic slump,and I agree. With these ideas and strategies, I strongly believe that Obama can improve the current state of the economy. Obama also has a plan to improve education. He believes that we need to start educating children at a young age. He also hopes to close the gap of achievement between students, which means improving schools that need help. He wants to pay teachers more and treat them like professionals,but in exchange he calls for higher responsibility. Obama also has a plan to make college more affordable. He wants public colleges to be free for students who maintain a ""B"" average during high school. And he plans to give a $4,000 tax credit for college and university students who complete 100 hours of community service each year. I believe these ideas to improve education are good enough and will help many students. Therefore, there is no longer any doubt in my mind who will be receiving my vote: Barack Obama."

The author and Femando left for the beach early because _ .	"Fernando and I were arguing about why I never took any real vacations.When he suggested we go off somewhere for three entire weeks,""You decide,""I said. He chose a little fishing village off the coast and he planned out a schedule.Our trip was full of wormer and fun,but when we got there,the shabby hotel failed to satisfy us,so we left a day early for the beach.As we drove,we passed two orphanages .Christmas was only a few days away,and I felt that I should stop to do something for the children. Then Femando came up with a plan to help the poor children we saw.We made a list of names,and then we went into town to buy new clothes,toys,and school supplies.For the rest of the day,we filled backpacks.We were excited about the celebration we had plantted for the next day,December 26,when we'd invite the families to the beach in front of the hotel and hand out the presents. Fernando and I were still in bed at around 9:00 the next morning when we heard a cracking sound.""What is that?""I asked.As if in response.water started pouring into our room.The children's backpacks we had arranged so neatly on the floor began floating around.The next thing I knew was that the roof was torn off.and Fernando and I were swept out. I thought I was going to die. Under the water, I forced myself to calm down and then I popped out.Suddenly I saw Fernando only four feet away. ""What just happened?""I asked Fernando. ""Tsunami !"",he shouted to me.""Just be strong.Whatever it was,""he told me,""It's all over now.""But a few seconds later,another wave buried us.I tried to grab him as he reached out to me,but he fell back under the water,and I never saw him again."

We Can infer from the text that Mr.Rochester _ .	"For several days I saw little of Mr.Rochester.In the morning he seemed much occupied with business,and in the afternoon gentlemen from the neighborhood called and sometimes stayed to dine with him.When his foot was well enough,he rode out a great deal. During this time,all my knowledge of him was limited to occasional meetings about the house,when he would sometimes pass me coldly,and sometimes bow and smile.His changes of manner did not offend me,because I saw that I had nothing to do with the cause of them. One evening,several days later,1 was invited to talk to Mr.Rochester after dinner.He was sitting in his armchair,and looked not quite so serious.There was a smile on his lips,and.his eyes were bright,probably with wine.As 1 was looking at him,he suddenly turned,and asked me,""do you think I'm handsome,Miss Eyre?'' The answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I realized it,""No,sir."" ""Ah,you really are unusual!"" ""Sir,I'm sorry.I should have said that beauty doesn't matter,or something like that."" ""No.You have honesty and feeling.There ale not many girls like you.But perhaps I go too fast.But I mean you're the sort of person people tell their problems and secrets to,because you're sympathetic and give them hope."" It seemed he had quite a lot to talk to me.He didn't seem to like to finish the talk quickly.""Don't be afraid of me,Miss Eyre.""He continued.""You don't relax or laugh very much.But in time you will be more natural with me,and laugh,and speak freely.You're like a bird in a cage.When you get out of the cage.You'11 fly very high.Good night."""

A potato has _ .	Most American children eat potatoes every day, but they don't know which part of potato is most nourishing .Take a sharp knife and cut a very thin slice from it and hold it to the light, and you will see that the potato has skin, an outside rim and the inner part. The outside rim which is right under the skin is most nutritious.But this part is often thrown away with the skin. Even the skin itself is better for food than the inside. When eating a cooked potato, if you choose the inside and leave the outside, you are wasting the best part of it. If you can't eat the whole potato, it is better to eat the outside rim and leave the inner part.	['three parts']
Which title do you think is more suitable for this article?	"Many a online shopper stayed up until 2 am on Sunday, looking through the Internet to buy products being sold at half price before they could _ (be bought)by other shoppers. Tens of millions of the Internet users were crazy to take advantage of the halfprice promotion, started by the ecommerce giant Alibaba Group on Sunday, Nov. 11, which is known as Singles' Day in China, and is the Chinese answer to Cyber Monday in the United States. By 7 pm on Sunday, 14.1 billion yuan's worth of sales was made on tmall. com and taobao. com. That could make Singles' Day the biggest ecommerce sales day on record.

Steve Jobs _ .	"The designer of the Apple Computer, Steve Jobs, was not quite successful in his early years. He was not among the best students at school, and from time to time he got into trouble with either his schoolmates or his teachers. But he was full of new ideas, which few people saw the _ of. Things remained the same when he went up to college and he dropped out halfway. Steve Jobs worked first as a video game designer at Atari. He worked there for only a few months and then he set out to tour India. He hoped that the trip would give him more ideas and give him a change in life for the better. After he returned from India, he begin to live on a farm in California. And then, in 1975, Steve Jobs set about making a new type of computer. Along with his friend Stephen Wozniak, he designed the Apple Computer in his bedroom and built it in his garage . He gave the name ""Apple"" because it reminded him of a happy summer he once on an orchard in Oregon. His Apple Computer was so successful that Steve Jobs soon became worldwide famous. But unluckily, he died of illness in 2011."	"[""didn't finish his college education""]"
What do Dr Pine's words imply?	"Men have long been puzzled by the amount women pack, when they go on holiday. They despair when they watch their beloved spend much money on extra baggage charge. Nearly half of these women admitted to lying about the weight of their case to their partner before leaving for the airport, in fear of being made to unload some unnecessary items. But it's a fact that women pack more than they need. On average, a woman needs around 57 items in suitcase for a two-week holiday, yet most women pack nearer to 150 items, ranging from skirts, tops, underwear and high heels. In addition, women pack more sun cream, make-up and hair appliances than they were likely to need. They all take up space in the suitcase, only a third of them will see the light of day once at the holiday place. 79 percent of women admitted to taking extra items with them, with the reason for this being ""just in case"". Women plan their holiday wardrobe months in advance. Packing enough clothes and other items to last a month is not enough for some women. They'd take a chance to shop for new items while holidaying abroad. So they'll return with even more luggage in their cases. Professor Karen Pine said: ""Women are tempted to take familiar items with them on holiday, often everything except the kitchen sink. Some people find traveling stressful, particularly when they're unsure about the home comforts available at their holiday place. They over-pack to help cope with those feelings of stress and reduce the uncertainty."" This will come as no surprise to some men, who are used to trying to squeeze their partner's luggage into the boot of the car with their own, smaller case. On the other hand, men pack very lightly, with only an average of 40 items for a two-week holiday."	"[""It's understandable that women over-pack in a sense.""]"
.What do you think is the theme of the story?	"When I decided to get married, my father decided to share some wisdom. ""Lori, it is just as easy to love a rich man as it is to love a poor man, "" he said. My boyfriend didn't have much money, but I loved him. ""What?"" I cried. "" How can you say that? I want to marry for love, NOT for money."" "" But why not marry someone you love who has money?"" he asked. ""Rich men are materialistic . I'd rather marry a poor man who loves me,"" I said and he gave in. And as we went on, with my family growing, I learned why my father put such importance on money. We had to cover the rent, car, electricity, food, and medical bills. We were under lot of pressure. The worries over whether we would be asked to move out or if we had the money to wash our clothes at the Laundromat this week made me question if I did the right thing by marrying a ""poor"" man. I realized that I had entered the ranks of the poor. Not that I'd ever been rich. Most of my life, I considered us in the lower middle-class rank. We had a house of our own, food on the table, cars, clothes, and money for college. But now, as I listened to an apartment neighbour talk about her monthly ""Mother's Day"" gift, I realized she was talking about her welfare check . And another young mother tried to ""help"" me out by connecting me with a friend who stole baby clothes from a department store. "" For a small cut,"" she said, "" I could return my 'purchase' for cash."" It made me sick. How poor was I? I had a college education but wasn't using it. I insisted on not missing a minute of our children's childhood and it came at a price. My husband was working as hard as he could and it wasn't enough. But somehow we made it. The kids grew. Today, we look back and see the great values gained by going through those hard years. My children are not materialistic. They never thought they were poor growing up because we always managed to give a little bit of food, money, or clothes to the ""poor"". They were satisfied with the simple things in life that come free such as a beach day or a horse back ride from their dad. We had our worries, but we still treasured our very favorite part of the day when we'd nest under the covers and talked about our future, the kids and how much we loved each other. Sure our financial troubles caused a lot of fights, but we didn't leave each other. We began to live a better life. We moved to a better community with good schools for the kids. And soon, we'll face a new challenge with wealth. But we'll never give up. My father died three years ago. Before he died, he knew I made the right choice. I'm proud of my decision."

We know from the passage that a loud person is _ .	Here are six steps to better studying. Pay attention in class Do you have trouble paying attention in class? Are you sitting next to a loud person? Tell your teacher or parents about any problem that is preventing you from paying attention. Take good notes Write down facts that your teacher mentions or writes on the board. Try to use good handwriting so you can read your notes later. It's a good idea to keep your notes organized by subject. Plan ahead for tests and projects Waiting until Thursday night to study for Friday's test will make it hard to do your best. One of the best ways to make sure that doesn't happen is to plan ahead. Write down your test dates. You can then plan how much to do after school each day, and how much time to spend on each topic. Break it up When there's a lot to study, it can help to break things into several parts. Let's say you have a spelling test on 20 words. Instead of thinking about all of the words at once, try breaking them down into five-word groups and work on one or two different groups each night. Ask for help You can't study effectively if you don't understand the material. Be sure to ask your teacher for help. If you're at home when the confusion occurs, your morn or dad might be able to help. Sleep tight So the test is tomorrow and you've followed your study plan--but suddenly you can't remember anything! Don't panic. Your brain needs time to digest all the information you've given it. Try to get a good night's sleep and you'll be surprised by what comes back to you in the morning.

Which of the following might Margolis agree with?	"Britons may like to complain a lot, but they rarely do so right now, explains BBC writer Ruth Margolis. They would rather grumble afterward. This is because Britons hate to put someone out and cause any embarrassment. Margolis writes, ""For instance, I'm much more comfortable just leaving that piece of raw chicken on my plate instead of complaining to restaurant staff. But beware: if this kind of thing happens when you're dining with an American, they will most likely speak up on your behalf and not understand why you find this ashamed."" In a BBC blog post comparing cultural differences between the UK and the US, Margolis mentions a few other things that Americans like to do that are offensive to Britons. * Not making introductions Margolis says most Britons dislike this approach because ""talking to strangers without being introduced gives them a stomachache"". Americans rarely introduce a new friend to their friends at parties. Strangers are supposed to introduce themselves. * ""Quite"" good Using ""quite"" to mean ""very"" happens a lot in the US. But if you are invited to a dinner party in Britain, don't describe the meal as ""quite good"" if you want to express high praise. To Britons' ears, ""quite"" _ the ""good"": the meal was OK but could have been better. * Money Talk Americans can talk about money subjects for hours without feeling uncomfortable. For Britons, says Margolis, ""Talking about how much we make is unthinkable -- even 1ess so than discussing our feelings."" * Over-politeness ""It's not that I want shop assistants to be actively rude. But neither do I want to expend energy responding to someone who's been paid to ask: 'How are you today?'"" says Margolis. In the US, it is not unusual to be greeted by a perfect stranger as ""honey"" or ""sweetie"". But Margolis says Britons find put-on friendliness, especially in stores, deeply irritating."

The example of Lynne is mentioned in the passage to show _ .	"Nowadays it is common that people are buying more products and services than ever before through the Internet, so do Americans. And experts say the popularity of online sales is likely to spread to other countries. Online sales now represent as much as 10% of all retail sales in the United States. This has led traditional stores to seek new ways to keep their customers loyal. Taking Lynne for example, she made good use of the Internet. she used the Internet to buy everything she needed for her Wedding and holiday gifts for her husband and stepdaughter. Other than food, 90% of her purchases were made on her home computer. ""I find that, by being able to go online, choose the things that I need, and have them delivered to me right at my doorstep, I _ all the driving, all the crowds, all the noise of that, and I usually get a better selection."" There are a lot of people like her. Experts say American online shopping hit records in both November and December. 57% of Americans have bought something electronically. Store owners worry that this growing amount of online sales will hurt their business. Cornell University marketing professor Ed Melaughlin says they can keep their customers by selling goods like clothing, which buyers may want to see and try on before purchasing. The stores could also offer things that are difficult to ship. Besides, some stores can please customers by offering to repair electronic products. Bill Martin is the founder of Shopper Trak. His business helps stores learn about their customers. He said, ""There is still a lot of emotion in the buying decision, you know, that takes place. Often you need that last sense of ""Boy, this is exactly what I want before you are ready to part with money, and you can't always get that online. It's a rather cold process."" While e-commerce worries some business owners, the only worry for delivery services is keeping up with the number of packages. UPS manager Dana Kline says her company is very busy at this time of the year. UPS is so busy that it has filled 55,000 temporary work positions during the holiday season."

The reason why music can help deal with stress is that _ .	Research has shown that music has an important effect on one's body and psyche . In fact, there is a growing field of health care known as music therapy, which uses music to treat diseases. Even hospitals are beginning to use music therapy. This is not surprising, as music affects the body and mind in many powerful ways. Research has shown that quick music can make a person feel more alert, while slow music can produce a calm, deep thinking state. Also, research has found that music can change brainwave activity levels. This can help the brain to change speeds more easily on its own as needed, which means that music can bring lasting benefits to your state of mind, even after you've stopped listening. Breathing and heart rates can also be influenced by music. This can mean slower breathing, slower heart rate. This is why music and music therapy can help reduce the damaging effects of long-term stress, greatly promoting not only relaxation, but health. Music can also be used to bring about a more positive state of mind by helping to keep worries away. Music has also been found to bring many other benefits, such as lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of strokes. It is no surprise that so many people are considering music as an important tool to help the body become or stay healthy.	['it does good to breathing and heart rates']
What's the best title for this passage?	Damini Bansal (14 years old) Freedom is something different in everybody's way of thinking--a student would probably like to raise a revolt against all the obnoxious rules of his or her school and as a grown up one might want to have less responsibilities . Freedom according to me is the power in me to make some of my life's decisions on my own. And this Independence Day will be a lot more different than our first one in 1947 when people actually came to know what it was like to be free, for them it was the dawn of a new day, it was a day when they could do what they felt was right. We have come far from all of this. We now no longer see the Independence Day as a day of very great importance for the students of my class (and most of the children of my age), and the most important value is that it is a holiday. Arihant Jain (12 years old) We can do anything we want like not going to school. Everything should be free. We should not pay money to buy anything. Can go anywhere I want...to the playground when exams are on. Chatting on phone as long as I want. To eat dinner outside everyday. In school being able to play sports and not study. Flying Kites.

Why did television and radio stations pause normal programming?	"Early last Tuesday, six men carrying machine guns, a pistol and a hunting rifle got on a four--car electric "" milk train"" at the Dutch town of Assen. Shortly after it left Beilen, ten miles away, the terrorists stopped the train and seized the passenger as hostages. As police and Dutch soldiers ringed the train, another group of terrorists stuck in Amsterdam, forcing their way into the Indonesian consulate and taking 41 more hostages, including 16 children. By week's end the terrorists had murdered three people aboard the train, and four more had been wounded in the raid on the consulate. The kidnapping, and the subsequent cold--blooded murders, virtually rocked the Netherlands. While the Cabinet met in emergency sessions, television and radio station paused normal programming in favor of solemn music and news bulletins. The terrorists were Indonesians from the South Moluccan Islands in the Pacific Ocean, and they were demanding that the Dutch help them gain independence from the Jakarta regime. The twin acts of violence were not the first signs of South Molucca anger. Just before a 1970 visit to the Netherlands by Indonesia's President Suharto, they attacked the Indonesian embassy in the Hague, killing a Dutch policeman. Last week's kidnappings are two days before the Dutch Appeals Court was to trial 16 South Moluccan's who were implicated in a plot last April to kidnap Queen Juliana and other members of the Royal family. They planned to storm the palace at Soestdijk after attacking the gates with an armoured car . The Moluccan headache is a heritage of the old days of empire. A chain of islands at the eastern of the Indonesian archipelago, the Moluccas were once known as the Spice Islands. When the Netherlands gave up its East Indies colonies in 1949, the Moluccans wanted to set up a South Moluccan Republic, some 12,000 islanders were allowed to settle to the Netherlands. Their number swollen by Dutch--born children now reached 35,000. the young Moluccans here are demanding that the Dutch help them gain independence from the Jakarta regime."

I remember as a child I said something unkind about somebody, and my father said, ""Any time you say something unpleasant about somebody else, it's a reflection of you."" He explained that if I looked for the best in people, I would get the best in return. From then on I've always tried to follow the principle in my life and later in running my company. Dad's also always very understanding. At 15, I started a magazine. It was taking up a great deal of my time, and the headmaster of my school gave me a choice: stay in school or leave to work on my magazine. I decided to leave, and Dad tried to _ the decision at first, as any good father would. When he realized I had made up my mind, he said, ""Richard, when I was 23, my dad persuaded me to go into law. And I've always regretted it. I wanted to be a biologist, but I didn't pursue my dream. You know what you want. Go fulfill it."" As it turned out, my little publication went on to become Student, a national magazine in the U.K.. My wife and I have two children, and I'd like to think we are bringing them up in the same way Dad raised me."	['He had a dream to fulfill']
Some birds ant because ant's secretions _ .	"Every so often, birds, just like humans, do what it takes to feel really, really good. The bird version is to sit on an anthill so that hundreds of ants climb all over their bodies, or even better, some birds pick up mouthfuls of pressed ants and rub themselves all over. Afterwards, the birds either eat the ants or set them free. Scientists call this ""anting."" It's a common bird practice, and is especially done by the smarter birds. Ravens do it. Magpies do it. However, birds aren't the only animals that use anting --- squirrels, cats, and hedgehogs have all been observed doing the same sort of thing! Why birds ""ant"" is something of a mystery, but one thought is acceptable. Ants have defensive secretions , chemical weapons they use to fight off other insects and bacteria. So pressed ants help the birds drive the insects away. Similarly, if you cover your body with them, you can move through the forest without worrying about being bitten by insects. Plus, ants are cheap. They are around. However, we have a better explanation. Birds ""ant"" a lot in spring and summer. For many birds, that's the season for birds to change feathers. So maybe ant secretions are like bath oil; they comfort the skin during feather replacement. A British scientist once declared ""the purpose of anting the stimulation and comfort of the body,"" and that the general effect ""is similar to that gained by man from the use of outside stimulants, and perhaps also smoking."" And like cigarettes, anting can become a habit. Another study compares anting to ""the human habits of smoking and drug taking,"" and says, ""it is enjoyed for the feeling of excitement it results in. So once experienced, it is difficult to stop."" That's why you often see mother birds shouting at their babies who come near their first anthill. ""Stay away from there, child... Don't touch those ants!"" they cry. I don't speak Raven. Or Magpie. But I have been a parent. So some things I know."	['can remove unwanted insects']
According to the passage, the more we learn _	Scientific Progress Most scientific progress is the result of careful consideration of work that has already been done. The wonderful world which lies before us today has been put up by hardworking men with clear heads and inventive mind, and these who follow them along life's road will improve on their efforts. It is sometimes necessary to question and even to disbelieve some of the statements made by experts. Action or experiment can often end an argument or achieve a breakthrough. When men were wondering whether it was possible to reach India by sailing westwards from Europe, and whether there was any land on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Christopher Columbus decides to act. He gathered some men, invited them to go on board his three ships, and set out across the dangerous waters of the Atlantic Ocean. He was successful in finding land, but it was not India. The result of his action was that the arguments came to the end. Any young man who wishes to do research must be courageous enough to question old beliefs and do some original thinking about them. Although we seem to know so much, there are many things we don't know. Even when we pull an atom to pieces, we do not really know what the pieces are, we often do not reach the reality behind what we discover, and the more we learn, the better we realize our ignorance.

From the passage, we can conclude _ .	"Sometimes successful health campaigns can have quite unexpected reactions. The years of warnings about skin cancer mean that Britons are happy to cover themselves in sunscreen or stay out of the sun altogether, but it also means that most of us are not getting enough vitamin D. Scientists announced yesterday that Britons need to increase to three times the amount of vitamin D they get per day. They called on food producers to fortify their products with more of the vitamin and suggested people should consider taking supplements to keep levels up. They also suggested getting out in the sun for short periods more often, but they warned against ""sun bingeing"". The government does not publish official advice on the amount of vitamin D people should take due to a lack of research, says Dr Birgit Teucher of the Institute for Food Research. But in the US, the government recommends 5 micrograms a day. By that count, Dr Birgit Teucher said that around 90% of Britons between 19 and 64 would be lacking in the vitamin because they only took around 3 micrograms a day. Vitamin D is important for absorption of calcium by the body, which is needed for healthy teeth and bones. A lack of it can lead to serious diseases in both children and adults. The vitamin can be found in some foods but it can also be obtained from chemicals in the skin reacting to sunlight. Dr Barbara Boucher said adults should get 5 to 25 micrograms a day. Shortage of vitamin D may be linked to diseases such as muscle weakness, high blood pressure and rickets . Dr Birgit Teucher gave several reasons for the lack among Britons. Increasing numbers of office-based jobs mean a lack of exposure to the sun; and the rise of becoming overweight means that vitamin D--which is fat soluble is increasingly stored in body fat, where it cannot be accessed readily. Professor Brian Wharton of the Institute of Child Health said that children in particular needed to have enough vitamin D to prevent rickets. Professor Graham Bentham, an environmental scientist at the University of East Anglia, added that babies who were only breast-fed probably need to take supplements in case their mother was vitamin D lacking. Those drinking milk were likely to be OK, thanks to the fortification of the drink. The scientists called on food producers to fortify milk, bread and breakfast nutrient to enable people to get their daily amount of the vitamin. Prof Graham Bentham added that 30 minutes of sun exposure to the face and forearms between April and October would be _ . Outside these months, the sun is not strong enough in Britain for the body to produce its own vitamin D. But Prof Graham Bentham warned against spending too long in the sun. ""Sun bingeing is well known to be dangerous,"" he said. ""In any case, vitamin D transformation in the skin switches off after a while so short frequent amounts are better for vitamin D formation."""

The author gives the example of FinalThoughts.com to make the point that _ .	"Today, there's hardly an aspect of our life that isn't being upended by the tons of information available on the hundreds of millions of sites crowding the Internet, not to mention its ability to keep us in constant touch with each other via electronic mail. ""If the automobile and aerospace technology had exploded at the same pace as computer and information technology,"" says Microsoft, ""a new car would cost about $ 2 and go 600 miles on a small quantity of gas. And you could buy a Boeing 747 for the cost of a pizza."" Probably the biggest payoff, however, is the billions of dollars the Internet is saving companies in producing goods and serving for the needs of their customers. Nothing like it has been seen since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when power-driven machines began producing more in a day than men could turn out in nearly a year. ""We view the growth of the Internet and e-commerce as a global trend,"" says Merrill Lynch, ""along the lines of printing press, the telephone, the computer, and electricity."" You would be hard pressed to name something that isn't available on the Internet. Consider: books, health care, movie tickets, construction materials, baby clothes, stocks, cattle feed, music, electronics, antiques, tools, real estate, toys, autographs of famous people, wine and airline tickets. And even after you've moved on to your final resting place, there's no reason those you love can't keep in touch. A company called FinalThoughts.com offers a place for you to store ""afterlife e-mails"" you can send to Heaven with the help of a ""guardian angel"". Kids today are so computer literate that it in fact ensures the United States will remain the unchallenged leader in cyberspace for the foreseeable future. Nearly all children in families with incomes of more than $75,000 a year have home computers, according to a study by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. Youngsters from ages 2 to 17 at all income levels have computers, with 52% of those connected to the Internet. Most kids use computers to play games (some for 30 hours or more a week), and many teenage girls think nothing of rushing home from school to have e-mail chats with friends they have just left. What's clear is that, whether we like it or not, the Internet is an ever growing part of our lives and there is no turning back. ""The Internet is just 20% invented,"" says cyber pioneer Jake Winebaum. ""The last 80% is happening now."""	['almost anything is available on the Internet']
You can read faster _ .	Reading is a good hobby for all kinds of reasons. First, reading is fun. You can always keep yourself happy if you like reading. You will never feel bored or tired. Next, you can read a book anywhere-- in a car, on a plane, or even in the bathroom. All you need is a book! Another good reason for reading is that it is useful. If you read as a hobby, you will get better and better at it. And you will read faster and find it easier to understand what you read. As you reading skills improve, you will probably find your schoolwork becomes much better. Some people say that reading is out of date . This is not true. You can read on computers, and the better you read, the better your computer skills will be. Good readers may become writers, too. They always have more things to write about. Reading is a wonderful hobby. Why not start reading right now?	['if you read as a hobby']
What is the best title for the passage _ ?	"""Oh, my God! Did I really just send that text?"" Most people have said something that they wish they could take back. And if they had paused to think about it first, they probably would have acted differently. Pausing doesn't pay off just when you speak. Scientific studies have shown that making a habit of pausing before you do something can actually have a big impact on how your life turns out. In making decisions we rely on two areas of the brain. One area creates and processes emotions; the other governs logical thought. The type of decision, how we feel about it, and how prepared we are to handle it help determine which brain area has the most influence. But our age also plays an important role. Thinking through the consequences of one's actions is actually harder for teens because the area controlling logical thought is not fully developed until around age 25. This is why teens often feel an intense emotional drive to act impulsively--it's how their brains are structured! Though this tendency to act without considering the outcomes can lead to problematic situations, impulsivity during the developmental years evolves because it makes teens more open to new experiences and ideas. This openness helps teens become independent adults. The key to making impulsivity work for you--instead of against you--is to train your brain by practicing pausing. This doesn't mean you stop taking risks or being open to new experiences. But you won't know if the risk is worth it until you think it through. Deciding to take a risk based on logic shows self-control, not impulsivity. What are different ways to pause? You might take a deep breath, count to 10, or ask, ""Is this worth it?"" Different strategies work for different people. Whatever works for you, keep doing it! By practicing pausing, you can actually change your brain. This means that over time, pausing, instead of immediately reacting, becomes your ""natural"" response. And with this change, people are on their way to enjoying the life rewards that come with high levels of self-control--even if they weren't natural--born pausers!"	['Push the Pause Button']

51. The officer was strict _ .	"A very strict officer was talking to some new soldiers whom he had to train. He had never seen them before, so began, ""My name is Stone, and I'm even harder than stone, so do what I tell you or there'll be trouble. Don't try any tricks with me, and then we'll get on well together."" Then he went to each soldier one after the other and asked him his name, ""Speak loudly so that everyone can hear you clearly,"" he said, ""and don't forget to call me 'sir'."" Each soldier told him name, until he came to the last one. This man remained silent, and so Captain Stone shouted at him, "" when I ask you a question, answer it! I'll ask you again: What's your name, soldier?"" The soldier was very unhappy, but at last he replied, ""My name's Stonebreaker, sir,"" he said nervously ."	['with any of his soldiers, new or old.']
According to Sigmund Freud's theory,we can infer that _ .	"Why do we laugh and get amusement from so many different things,from puns to pratfalls? Why are some things funny to some people and not to others? How is that while a successful joke can cause pleasure,a sick one can cause serious harm? Over the centuries,various scholars have attempted to produce a universally agreed-upon theory of humor.Plato and Aristotle introduced the superiority theory,the idea that people laugh at the misfortune of others.Their theory seems to explain teasing,but it doesn't work well for knock-knock jokes.Sigmund Freud argued for his relief theory,the concept that humor is a way for people to release psychological tension and reveal their inner fears and desires.His theory works well for dirty jokes,less well for most puns. The majority of humor expels today agree with the incongruity theory,the idea that humor arises when there's a gap between what people expect to happen and what actually happens.Incongruity has a lot going for it -- jokes with unexpected funny lines,for example,fit well.But scientists have found that in comedy,unexpectedness is overvalued. With the goal of developing a new,more satisfactory explanation,I produced ""the gentle violation theory"",the idea that humor arises when something seems wrong or threatening,but is actually OK or safe.A dirty joke,for example,trades on moral or social violations,but it's only going to get a laugh if the person listening is open enough to consider the subject OK to talk about.Similarly,puns can be seen as linguistic violations that still make grammatical sense. And while most humor theories have struggled to account for tickling ,or just avoided the phenomenon altogether,my theory accounts for even this kind of laughter.Tickling involves violating someone's physical space in a gentle way.People can't tickle themselves -- because it isn't a violation."	"[""telling dirty jokes is a relief of one's nervous feelings '""]"
Which of the following is NOT true?	Penguins live together, but each pair has a little piece of ground of their own. When a penguin wants to walk through its neighbor's ground, it must ask for permission . If it does not, it will have to fight. Penguins come and go all day. They fight for fish and look after their children. All penguins are good parents--the male penguins are perhaps the best parents in the world. They choose their wives in the dark They can only hear them--not see them. Then the female penguins lay their eggs and go away for about two months. The males look after the eggs. If the eggs get cold, there will be no chicks. There is no food. The snow falls and the wind blows--sometimes at 150 kilometers an hour. The penguins do not move. When the females return from the sea, they will not remember their husbands. It doesn't matter. Only one thing-- their eggs. Male penguins never fight--unless a penguin leaves a chick for a minute. Then they fight because they all want it. They are strange and wonderful birds.	['Female penguins take care of the eggs.']
To Adrian Fernandez, _ is the most important.	"Food or friends? Lip salve or iPod? What is the most important thing in the US teenagers' lives today? Let's take a look. Some find that they can't do without people. ""My biggest need is my friends. Without them, I wouldn't do much,"" said Adrian Fernandez, a 14-year-old boy. With others, food always comes first. ""I do not think that I could live without chili con carne . I eat it every day. And if I didn't have it, it's all I would think about,"" said Max Wu, an 8th-grade boy. Sometimes, the things teenagers can't do without are strange. Take 14-year-old girl Hannah Sacchini for example. ""I cannot live without lip salve, especially in winter,"" said Hannah Sacchini. ""I go mad if my lips get dry."" Of course, today everybody uses mobile phones and computers. Some teens can't live without these high-tech things. Justin Beck, a 15-year-old boy, feels like this: ""I would not be able to live without my iPod. I use it for so many different things. I always have it with me,"" he said. So, now we know the things US kids really must have. What about you and your classmates? What can't you live without? ,. (10)"	['a friend']
The example of Finland is used to illustrate _ .	We've reached a strange--some would say unusual--point. While fighting world hunger continues to be the matter of vital importance according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more people now die from being overweight, or say, from being extremely fat, than from being underweight. It's the good life that's more likely to kill us these days. Worse, nearly l8 million children under the age of five around the world are estimated to be overweight. What's going on? We really don't have many excuses for our weight problems. The dangers of the problem have been drilled into us by public-health campaigns since 2001 and the message is getting through--up to a point. In the 1970s, Finland, for example, had the highest rate of heart disease in the world and being overweight was its main cause. Not any more. A public-health campaign has greatly reduced the number of heart disease deaths by 80 per cent over the past three decades. Maybe that explains why the percentage of people in Finland taking diet pills doubled between 2001 and 2005, and doctors even offer surgery of removing fat inside and change the shape of the body. That has become a sort of fashion. No wonder it ranks as the world's most body-conscious country. We know what we should be doing to lose weight--but actually doing it is another matter. By far the most popular excuse is not taking enough exercise. More than half of us admit we lack willpower. Others blame good food. They say: it's just too inviting and it makes them overeat. Still others lay the blame on the Americans, complaining that pounds have piled on thanks to eating too much American-style fast food. Some also blame their parents--their genes. But unfortunately, the parents are wronged because they're normal in shape, or rather slim. It's a similar story around the world, although people are relatively unlikely to have tried to lose weight. Parents are eager to see their kids shape up. Do as I say--not as I do.

Which of the following statements is TRUE to the passage?	"""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"" is a popular saying in the United States. Other countries have similar sayings. It is true that all of us need _ We cannot work all the time if we are going to keep good health and enjoy life. Everyone has his own way of relaxing. Perhaps the most popular way is to take part in sports. there are team sports, such as baseball, basketball, and football. There are individual sports, also, such as golf and swimming. In addition hiking, fishing, skiing, and mountain climbing have a great attraction for people who like to be outdoors. Not everyone who enjoys sports events likes to take part in them. Many people prefer to be onlookers, either watching them on television, or listening to them on the radio. When there is an important baseball game or boxing match it is almost impossible to get tickets; everyone wants to attend. Chess, card-playing, and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by many people. It doesn't matter whether we play a fast game of ping-pong, concentrate over the bridge table, or go walking through the woods on a brisk autumn afternoon. It is important for every one to relax from time to time and enjoy some form of recreation."	['Sometimes those who enjoy sports events like to take part in them, too.']
The sky looks blue mainly because the color blue in the sunlight _ .	"A recent survey of 2000 parents in Britain showed that they are often afraid of science questions asked by their curious children only because they have no idea what the answer is. Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits ""raised area"" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months."	['cannot pass through space successfully']
The news mentioned in the very beginning is intended to _ .	The news that China bans time-travel TV dramas and movies got a lot of attention on the Internet. Yet, time travel in China is a bit different from time travel in common sense. It is anything but science fiction and always goes backwards in time. There is minimum imagination involved--no ever-ending circles that mess up present and future, no advanced technology, no new social orders or new human forms from the twenty--whatever century, everything is a known historical fact when you travel through in China. It is not even called time travel; rather the Chinese people refer to it as time crossover. Time crossover has been an extremely popular theme for online novels for years (in fact, it is an indispensable part of China's online culture), and didn't get picked up by TV and the big screen until recent two years. Most of time-travel dramas and movies are adapted from popular online novels and like in other cases adaptations are never better than the original books. The main plot of time-travel novels or TV dramas can be very well summarized in one sentence: from nobody to somebody. Time travel in China is more about escaping from the reality than about realizing wild dreams. In China, there is no need of time machine either. People travel backwards in time via the possession of antiques presence at historical places of interest encounter of life-threatening accidents or simple a look into the mirror. Some time-travel novels even start with ''I wanted togo back to history so much that one morning when I opened my eyes I was back.'' Technology is not relevant at all. Though China is not short of histories to go back to, people have their own preferences and it is pretty much a gender thing.If the main character is male then he usually goes back to special times in history when he is able to help build up or tear up a dynasty. A typical example is A Step Into the Past , the first time-travel TV drama in China, which tells the story of how a SWAT member helps to unite China and build up Qin Dynasty. On the other hand, female characters primarily go back to Qing Dynasty partly because Qing Dynasty has the most number of princes to fall in love with. YongZheng Emperor is the favorite. As can be seen in Startling by Each Step , a Qing time crossover classic, a girl goes back to Qing Dynasty and falls in love with YongZheng Emperor and his brothers.	['introduce the topic']

The main reason for the fishing company to fish in the far sea was that _ .	"It is well known that the Japanese people's love of fish is almost as a bee's interest in honey. As fish populations were decreasing, fishing companies were forced to fish further and further away from the shore. Then they had a big challenge -how to keep the fish fresh for longer. So they decided to keep the fish stored in freezers on the boats. But the public did not like frozen fish. So again the fishing companies had a new bigger challenge. What they decided to do was to have fish tanks on their boats. After catching fishes, they would put them in the tanks and keep them living there until they got back to shore. But in this protected environment, lacking predators ,the fish stopped moving around. The Japanese public felt these dull fish did not taste fresh, which had an unpleasant effect upon sales. Once again the fishing companies had an even bigger challenge. Stop for a minute! Before we go any further, I would like to ask ""What are your challenges? How do you handle an unexpected challenge?"" May I think it this way that you should try to attack your challenges? Conquer them with a Swiss Army knife. Take the most proper and simple tool that you can adopt to deal with your situation. Now back to our story. How did the Japanese finally figure out the fresh fish problem?Sharks! You might think the same. Sharks were caught and put into the tanks with other fishes. Don't sharks eat fish? Well, they do eat a few fish, but they did also keep more fish active and alert . The fish stay fresh because they are challenged. _ to offer yourself a challenge in your own business and career."	['the fish resource near the shore was on the decrease']
The sign at a Korean university is written in _ .	"There is a sign at a Korean university asking tourists not to step into the grass to take photos. The sign is not written in Korean or English; it is written in Chinese. These signs, and signs in other countries warning Chinese tourists about their behavior, have shamed many Chinese who worry about the image of the country. Over 70 million Chinese tourists made overseas trips last year and spent $102 billion, more than the $84 billion spent by American and German tourists. For many Chinese tourists, it was their first trip abroad and they didn't know about foreign ways. And some of these tourists took their bad habits from China with them. Wang Yang, a Chinese deputy prime minister , said, ""They(the tourists) speak loudly in public, carve words or numbers on tourist attractions, cross the road when the traffic lights are still red and spit anywhere. It damages the image of the Chinese people and has a very bad influence."" Before you travel to a foreign country, it's important to learn some things about the country and its culture. You are guests in the country and it's important to respect your hosts. As more and more Chinese visit foreign countries, their behavior will certainly change and those shameful signs will, hopefully, disappear."	['Chinese']
What can we learn about Gilbert?	"My son Gilbert was eight years old and had been in the Cub Scouts only a short time. Once he was handed a sheet of paper, a block of wood and four tires and told to return home and give them all to his father. That was not an easy task for Gilbert to do. The piece of paper was a set of instructions about how to build a wooden racing car. Gilbert's father laughed when he read the instructions. The block of wood remained untouched as the weeks passed. Finally, I stepped in to see if I could figure it all out. Having no skills, I decided it would be best if I simply read the instructions and let Gilbert do the work. And he did. Within days, his block of wood was turning into a pinewood racing car. Then the big night came. With his pinewood racing car in his hand and pride in his heart we headed to the big race. As the race was done in elimination fashion , you could keep racing as long as you were the winner. Finally, it was between Gilbert and the fastestlooking car there. As the race was about to begin, Gilbert asked if they could stop for a minute, because he wanted to pray. Then the race stopped. Gilbert prayed in earnest for a very long minute. The Master came up to Gilbert and asked the obvious question, ""So you prayed to win, Gilbert?"" My young son answered, ""Oh, no Sir. It wouldn't be fair to ask God to help you beat someone else. I just asked him to make it so I don't cry when I lose."" Children seem to have wisdom far beyond us. Perhaps we spend too much of our prayer time asking God to control the race, make us the champion, or remove us from the struggle, when we should be seeking God's strength to get through what lies in our way."

To prevent accidents, a drivers Ed car _ .	"In America, drivers' education is part of the regular high school curriculum. Every student in his or her second year of high school is required to take a class in driver's education. However, unlike other courses, it is not given during the regular school year. Instead it is a summer course. The course is divided up into two parts: class time for learning laws and regulations and driving time to practice driving. Class time is not unlike any other class. The students have a text from which they study the basic laws they must know to pass the written driving test that is given to anyone wanting to get a driver's license. Driving time is a chance for the students to get behind the wheel (steering wheel) and practice starting steering, backing up, parking, switching lanes, turning corners, and all the other maneuvers required to drive a car. Each student is required to drive a total of six hours. The students are divided up into groups of four. The students and the instructor go out driving for two hour blocks of time. Thus, each student gets half an hour driving time per outing. The instructor and ""driver"" sit in the front seats and the other three students sit in the back. Drivers Ed cars are unlike other cars in which they have two sets of brakes, one on the driver's side and one on the other side where the instructor sits. Thus, if the student driver should run into difficulties the instructor can take over. The car also has another special feature. On the top of the car is a sign that reads: STUDENT DRIVER. That lets nearby drivers know that they should use extra caution because the student driver is a beginning driver, not very experienced and prone to driving slowly. After the student has passed the driver's education course and reached the appropriate age to drive (this age differs in every state but in most cases the person must be 16 years old), they can go to a designated state office to take their driver's test, which is made up of an eye examination, a written test, and a road test. The person must pass all three tests in order to be given a driver's license. If the person did well in his or her driver's education class, he or she will pass the test with flying colors and get a driver's license."	['has two sets of brakes']

What's the author's attitude towards her having diabetes now?	Mom noticed that something was wrong when I started getting so thirsty, I'd have a lot to drink before bed, which was unusual for me. One time, I opened a big container of apple juice and kept refilling my glass. Before I knew it, I'd drunk the entire container! My mom call my doctor. I then had a few blood tests, and the results were certain ------ I had diabetes, which meant that the amount of sugar in my blood was very high. That can be dangerous, so I had to learn how to control my blood-sugar level. My eating habits had to change in a big way. With diabetes, I can't eat a lot of sugar or carbohydrates. I have to figure out exactly how much sugar I plan to eat, and then I get an injection of insulin before the meals to help my body process the food. Also, I test my blood-sugar level often. I'm always trying to keep my blood sugar at a healthy level. The level can drop when I exercise, but that doesn't keep me out of gym class or off the basketball court ------ I just keep some juice boxes around to _ my blood sugar if I need to. It's a lot of work ------ and not a lot of fun ------ to keep track of everything, but I've gotten used to my new habits. I was a little scared at first because I wasn't sure how my life would change. Once I knew what I needed to do, though, it wasn't a big deal. My life is different now from what it was before, but it has become completely regular to me.	['Positive.']
How does a scientist usually test a theory?	On a hot summer day, ice-cold watermelons serve up a delicious treat. Sure, the rosy flesh quenches your thirst . But now there are more reasons than ever for people to reach for a slice of watermelon. Meet Dr Alison Edwards. She is a scientist at the Agricultural Research Service. Scientists are people who come up with new ideas called theories . They usually do scientific research to test their new theories. That's how they find out if a new idea is a good one, or if the new idea will bring an even better idea. At her lab, Dr Edwards recently learned more about the secrets of why watermelons are good for you! Dr Edwards has known for a long time that watermelons have vitamin C. But recently she learned that watermelons also have lycopene . It is something that gives tomatoes and watermelons their rosy red colour. What's so special about the lycopene in watermelons? Dr Edwards says that watermelons and tomatoes both have lots of lycopene. It seems that your body can use the lycopene from watermelons more easily than the lycopene from raw tomatoes. In fact, the lycopene from tomatoes is more easily absorbed inside your body once they have been cooked.	['By doing scientific research.']
69. Which of the following is NOT true according to Paragraph 4?	Lack of exercise is considered a risk factor for cancer. There is considerable evidence that inactivity is connected with increased risk for lung cancer, breast cancer, etc. In the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study, more than 32,000 people (25,000 men and 7,000 women) were given a preventive medical examination that included a machine exercise test to measure physical fitness. They were given a physical fitness score, with one being the lowest and five being the highest fitness level. Then these people were followed for an average of 8 years. During this time, 179 men and 44 women died of cancer. Data from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study show people have lower rates of cancer with higher levels of physical fitness. Studies from the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas suggest that men with high fitness levels are less likely to die of cancer. The Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study also found that fitness level was more important than weight in predicting longevity . While results showed that fitness and normal weight are the ideal combination, researchers found that men who were fat but performed well in the machine performance had just a slightly increased all-cause death rate, including cancer, compared to the more slim men. The fat, but fit, men particularly lived longer than the slim, but flabby , men. These statistics called for a warning to the overweight: The first health goal for the overweight should be to become as fit as possible at their current weight.	['Slim men are more likely to live longer.']
What's the main idea of this passage?	Most children like chocolates, candies and other kinds of sweet food. Sometimes they put a lot of sugar into their food. They don't know that sugar is bad for their teeth. Children also like fast food. It is _ delicious than home cooking, and children can take it away and eat it anywhere. Other children like to eat too much meat. Fast food or too much meat doesn't help _ a strong and healthy body. Children grow fast. They need to eat more eggs, milk, corn ,fruit, vegetables and other healthy things. Eggs and milk are good for their bones. Corn gives them energy. Fruit and vegetables give them vitamins . Children should eat an egg, and have about 200ml of milk every day. It's best to drink milk after eating bread in the morning. They should eat 150g of corn to give them energy, too. They should also eat an apple or some other fruit with their breakfast. Eating enough vegetables is important for lunch and supper.	['Children should eat more healthy foods.']
We can infer that _ .	"*Ms Tan, you've referred to your new novel as your eighth book. That's because it took me six or seven attempts at a second novel before I started and completed this one. *Why do you think you had so many false starts? I would say that my reasons were wrong. I was trying to prove that I wasn't just a mother-daughter storyteller, or I was trying to prove that I didn't just have to write about things that were strictly Chinese or Chinese-American. Those were never the right reasons for writing those early stories. And I could never come up with other better reasons for continuing them. *What kept you going on this book? This book was different because it was based on my mother's real life. The reason for writing it became more personal and emotional. AfterThe Joy Luck Clubcame out, my mother was always explaining to people that she wasn't any of the mothers in that book. And at one point she said to me, ""Next book tells my true story."" And then she started telling me things I never knew before. She also told me many, many stories, because my mother doesn't generalize . The book really grew out of that. *Have you ever visited China? Yes. I've been there twice: about three years ago and then again last November, both times with my mother and my husband. *Was it difficult to understand the Chinese-American dialect without sounding like a parody ? No, because it's the language I've heard all my life from my mother. She speaks English as it's direct translation from Chinese. But it's more than that. Her language also has more imagery than English. *Can you think of an example? Somebody might say to me, ""Don't work so hard. You'll kill yourself."" My mother will say to me,""Why do you press all your brains out on this page for someone else?"" So it's very vivid. That's the way she talks. *Have many readers told you that the Chinese mother in your book reminded them of the typical Jewish mother? Many people have told me that. I think the mother-daughter relationship is very intense in both cases. Culturally there is an acceptance that mothers have the power to tell their children, especially their daughters, how to conduct their lives --- not simply up until the time they are 18, but for the rest of their lives. However, when children grow up in a different culture from their parents',they tend to keep more secrets from their parents. The children think, ""They just wouldn't understand that I had to do this."" And that can really create a gap, and it can grow as the number of secrets grows."	"[""Tan' s mother is a good storyteller""]"
If you expect the uses to work properly, _ .	With about 10 million new iPhone 6s ordered in the initial days on the market, a lot of old iPhones are bound to be thrown into the dustbins. Sure, you could sell, donate or recycle your old iPhone, but you probably will not. And there are better things to do with it. One creative example: At the Missouri University of Science and Technology, a biology class is making old iPhones into microscopes. Using less than $10 worth of supplies, the old phones are mounted onto a lens and can magnify an object to 175 times its size. Here are 5 smart-and-cheap uses for old iPhones. Music for your car Take your music library on the road. Some cars are equipped with docking ports for iPhones and have dashboard screens so you can choose your favourite music hands-free. Or you can just use the cigarette lighter for power. Remote Control Televisions, speakers and other devices now have apps that allow users to make their iPhones into fashionable remotes. Carm Lyman, 42, of Napa, California, transformed his iPhone 4 into a remote for his household sound system after his iPhone 5 arrived. Lyman can control the audio levels and activate speakers in various parts of his home as well as access different music services. Cookbook No need to go through recipe books or hunt around for other devices when you have a kitchen iPhone. Download a cookbook app, such as My Recipe Book (99 cents) or Big Oven (free), and just leave the device on the kitchen counter. It takes up almost no space and will hold far more recipes than any book. Baby Monitor Sure, you can spend $100 or more on a baby monitor, or you can just set your old iPhone up to watch video of your baby in real time as well as hear and even talk to him or her. Cloud Baby Monitor ($3.99) also allows parents to receive the signal on a wireless network or on WiFi so they do not have to be within a certain number of feet of the monitor. Vehicle Tracker Whether you need to find your car if it is stolen, record where you have traveled, or spy on your teenage driver, the built-in GPS in your phone can be used as a tracking device. An app like InstaMapper ($2.99) lets you watch the vehicle in real-time and have a record of it. Keep in mind that the phone can still dial 911, even if it does not have cellphone service, Smith said. You can also use your old phone as a back-up in case your new model suffers irreparable harm. That said, the battery of a phone that sits in a drawer unused could be exhausted to the point where it is no longer workable.	['some extra work must be done to your phone']
On the fight day, _ .	Spain is famous for its tomato festival, called La Tomatina. It happens in a small town Hanoi on the last Wednesday of August every year. During the festival there are all kinds of activities, but the most exciting part is the tomato fight. It takes place at the end of long celebration . You are encouraged to throw tomatoes in the fight. There're many stories about how the festival began. One of the stories goes that during the 1940's, some friends started a tomato fight, while another story is about a local band. Anyway, everyone in Bunol seems to have a different story. Before the tomato fight, there are parades ,musical bands, street parties and so on. On the day of the fight, shopkeepers cover their windows and doors in order to keep away from the tomato fight. At the same time, thousands of tourists and local people come to the town square together. Then large trucks full of tomatoes arrive. From theback of the large trucks, a great town band start to throw tomatoes at others. Then the crowds fight back, throwing the tomatoes at anything and anyone. Soon the streets are in the sea of red tomato juice. Everyone is supposed to obey a small number of rules: You must squash the tomato before throwing it and you are allowed to throw nothing but tomatoes. It is usually over in less than half an hour. Everyone then sets off to the river to clearup. Sounds like fun!	['lots of tourists and local people take part in the fight']
Which of the following statements is true according to Golden?	"Garry Golden is a futurist. Futurists are scientists who analyze the way the world is today and use that information.to predict what the world will be like in the future. Golden focuses on the study of transportation. He spends his days studying the relationships between cars, subways, and trains. But he's most excited about imagining the way these relationships will change in the future. Many public transportation supporters dislike big cities because they spend hours driving from one side of the city to the other. And there aren't enough buses and. subways. However, Golden sees a trend toward fewer cars' in the future. He explains, ""Cities have a cost of car ownership, which is a challenge. All these vehicles cost the city in services, in having to repair roads and other things. ""Cars also take up a lot of space. Golden points out that having so many parking spaces is wasteful. Much of the time the parking spaces sit empty. What is the solution?""I think cities will make new laws to limit the number of cars people can have ,"" says Golden. ""Instead, people will use taxis, subways, and buses. New technology, like smartphones, can make these forms of public transportation even better. Imagine if everyone had a smartphone and used them to signal when they wanted to ride the bus. Buses could change their route to meet people's requests."" How soon would these changes come? Golden admits that it will take several years. Cities can be slow to change. Also, new systems of transportation can be expensive. ""But it's coming,"" he says. ""The trend of the empowered city will be here soon. "" The other trend that excites Golden is electric cars. Golden especially believes in the future of electric cars that have sensors to understand the world around them. ""If we have cars that can communicate with one another, they can adjust speeds to cut down on traffic jams,""he says. Rush hour in big cities would be much less painful. One challenge is that it is hard to cheaply produce batteries that are strong enough for these cars. But Golden argues we could, also make cars out of strong plastic composites . The cars would then be much lighter and much cheaper to make. Golden remains positive about the future. ""There are so many exciting developments ,""he says. ""In thirty years we will live a different world. """	['Future buses can receive signals and change their routes accordingly:']
To speed up your reading, you should _ .	So much to do, so little time.So much information, so little time to read.In this age there is more information than ever before.There is not enough time to read everything we want to read.However, you can take in and understand more information in shorter time through speed-reading.This article will not make you read 3,000 words per minute, but it will show you how to increase your speed greatly.You will also learn the basic techniques of speed reading, along with the dos and don'ts of speed-reading. When you first learned to read, you would say the word out loud and sound it out.Then you might whisper the word because people can become annoyed when you read aloud.The stage you are now at is saying the word in your head.Most people tend to read this way.Saying the word in your head will cut your reading speed tremendously . How do you calculate your reading speed? The speed is measured by how many words per minute you can read.Get some reading material, preferably a book.Find out how many words are on the page.Time yourself one minute.Start your timer and start reading.When the timer sounds, stop at once.If you counted 500 words on the page and you read half of the page, then you are probably reading at 250 words per minute. The first thing about speed-reading is looking at the word and recognizing it.Don't say the word in your mind, just look at it and recognize its appearance.Later you will recognize groups of four words or more to increase your speed.This is the first and most important step in speed-reading. The next step is technique.As with any other skill, speed-reading requires technique.You should first be sitting up straight with your book on a horizontal surface, such as a table or desk.Next, should be able to see the entire page.This is necessary if you want to recognize clumps of words.Lastly, _ .It's hard to read with a lot of noise.Find a quiet place to read.This will help your understanding of the text.You need something to guide your eyes while reading.Then right, you should use your hand.Remember when you were little, you would read using your finger.That is a great technique, only now you're using your hand to underline each line.Move your finger smoothly across page.No need to go rush, start out slow.Keep your eyes focused on words as you recognize them while using your hand as a guide.This will increase your speed. The third step is practice.Practice makes perfect.Set time intervals.Read using different techniques, but make sure you understand what you're reading.

What's the author's attitude towards technology?	For Canadians, backpacking Europe is a special ceremony signifying a new life stage. Unlike package tours, backpacking is a struggle, full of discovery and chance connections. It is about focusing on something different from our own lives and losing ourselves in a new world, if only for a moment. Well, that's what backpacking Europe is supposed to do. That's what it used to do before modern communications, social media, and commercial hostelling . Older Canadians would not recognize the Europe that they backpacked in the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s. Far from a rough adventure into foreign cultures, the European experience has been _ in part by today's technology. A few years ago, I took my then 60-year-old father on a backpacking trip across part of Europe and Turkey. As he is an experienced traveler and someone who possesses a strong sense of adventure, I decided that we'd travel on a budget, staying in hostel dorms. For him, backpacking through Europe in 1969 was about independence and struggle. But two things surprised him at the end of our journey. First was how technology-based backpacking had become: Young people were so directly connected to home that they were hardly away in any meaningful sense. Second, the lack of connections we made with locals. Instead of making us feel closer to a place, he found commercial hostelling actually made us more alienated . But there was some room for hope. While technology takes our attention away from the beauty and history before us, there were also ways in which it helped us to connect with our surroundings. Websites like Airbnb have made it easier to stay with enthusiastic locals. Couch Surfing helps organize meet-ups between locals and travelers. The online marketplace Dopios offers a chance to meet locals through enjoyable experiences like a personalized city tour. Backpacking can never be the way it was for our parents' generation. But doing a little study of history and culture before leaving, and bravely getting rid of any electronic devices while traveling, will help give young travelers a taste of the glory days.

It is implied that _ .	Most employers say that they wish to employ the right person for the right job. A recent report by Britain's Independent Institute of Manpower Studies, however, disagrees with this. The report states that most employers wish to avoid employing the wrong person. Rather than looking for the right person, they are looking for applicants to turn down. The report also suggests that in Britain and in many other parts of the world the selection methods used to pick out the right person for the job certainly do not match up to those used to judge a piece of new equipment. Employers used three main selection methods: interviewing, checking resume or application forms and examining references. Most of the employers asked in this survey stated that these selection methods were used more for weeding out unsuitable applicants rather than for finding suitable ones. Interviews were considered to be more reliable than either resume checks or references from past employers. Research, however, proves otherwise. Interviewers' decisions are often strongly influenced by their earlier judgment of the written application. Also different employers view facts differently. One may consider applicants who have frequently changed jobs as people with broad and useful experience. Another will see such applicants as unreliable and unlikely to stay for long in the new job. Some employers place great importance on academic qualifications whereas the link between this and success in management is not necessarily strong. Some employers use handwriting as a standard. The report states that there is little evidence to support the value of the letter for judging working ability. References, also, are sometimes unreliable as they are not very important while checks on credit and security records and applicants' political opinions are often the opposite. The report is more favorable towards trainability tests and those which test personality and personal and mental skills. The report concludes by suggesting that interviewing could become more reliable if the questions were arranged in a careful, organized system and focused on the needs of the employing organization.

You are not supposed to chat on your cell phone _ .	"Read our guide because ---trust us--- you don't want to be the one everyone's rolling their eyes at. GO RIGHT AHEAD: GOLDEN RULE: Home is pretty much the only place where you can safely blab about anything without having to consider the needs of the people around you. HANDLE WITH CARE in these places: Waiting rooms: People here tend to be feeling anxious about their news --- not yours. Shopping: Chatting while you're in line will slow down checkout and make other shoppers angry. GO RIGHT AHEAD: Make calls quickly and quietly, and be respectful of those forced to listen. DON'T DO IT in these places: Museums/libraries/churches: There are places we go for peace and quiet --- it's not proper to disturb others. Movies and plays: People pay to hear someone other than you perform. Elevators/ bathrooms/ beauty salons/ public transportation: No one around you can escape. Why force them to listen to your chitchat? Restaurants: People come here partly to get away from ringing phones and enjoy their conversations , so don't subject them to yours. GO RIGHT AHEAD: Put your phone on vibrate if you must get a call but always wait until you are outside before you start talking. While driving a car: It's rude to put other drivers in danger. So instead of going by the Golden Rules above, use a voice-activated phone --- and use it as little as possible.

The purpose of the passage is to _ .	It might sound ridiculous that goal setting could actually hold you back from completing tasks and dreams you may have. But it seems like everyone tells you should be setting goals for everything you want to accomplish, short term and long term. Goals can help you sometimes, but in some cases they just lead to constant frustration and they actually bring you down. Let's look at this a little closer with an example. A lot of people might set forth as a goal. Many people jump online and are looking to start a business online as a way to make money from home and let's say they set a goal to make $10,000 in their first month. They do this because they seem tons of people making large sums of money in very little time so they think, $10,000 a month, that shouldn't be too hard. But what happens when you only bring in $1,000 in your first 30 days online? If this is pure profit you might still be happy but this is nowhere near reaching the goal you originally set out to meet. So naturally you would feel like you failed to reach your goal and you may be a little disappointed in yourself. If you continue not to reach this goal month in month , it starts to add up and really weighs on you. I'm not saying that they are bad and you shouldn't set them but you need to realize that you should not be emotionally attached to your goals. An alternative approach would be to set certain milestones for when you want to accomplish things and start out small. Build your confidence by accomplishing smaller feats and if you overproduce, then it will be a nice surprise. You have to have some sort of end result in mind but break it down in to a day by day task. It makes it a lot easier for you to handle by just knowing everyday you have to complete a few small tasks and over time the snowball will roll into great things.

What can be inferred from the fact that most of the astronauts' urine is recycled?	Zero gravity looks cool. But what about the thing no one likes to talk about? Yes, that is right: going to bathroom. Zero gravity makes this everyday task quite a challenge. Astronauts have to be toilet-trained all over again. The Apollo astronauts raised themselves off the seat of their chairs and stuck a clear plastic bag to their back sides with sticky strips. A second astronaut watched closely to be sure no waste matter escaped the seal. (You would not want that stuff floating around the cabin!) When the deed was done, the astronaut cleaned up with a piece of plastic attached to the inside of the bag, removed the bag, dropped a disinfectant pill in with the waste matter, and put the whole thing, sealed, into a special container. Donald W. Rethke, an engineer for Hamilton Standard Space Systems, developed a more private way to answer nature's call: the space toilet. It is somewhat like the kind of toilet one would find on commercial airplanes --- with unique adaptations for zero gravity, of course. For instance, it has thigh bars that keep the astronaut from floating off the seat. The astronaut (male or female) defecates in a bag and urinates in a hose. Solid and liquid wastes are kept separated because at least 85% of the urine is recycled and, yes, after careful filtration, used for drinking and other purposes. (Water is always in demand in space.) A vacuum sucks the waste materials into the toilet, where the waste is compacted into hamburger-like patties for easy storage. Although not exactly like an earthbound visit to the toilet, it is at the very least much more private than in the early days of space travel.	['Water is limited on the space shuttle.']
According to the passage, playing music in restaurants is to _ .	Have you ever thought about why malls, restaurants, and even theaters have music? Well, to understand this, you simply just look back at how you felt when you heard music in these places. Music is known to improve the mood of people. Often music helps us pay attention to what we are doing. Music helps patients feel good and helps them recover faster and better. Depression is a state of mind that most of us experience at some point of time. There are some periods in our life when everything seems difficult. It seems that everything is getting worse and we have no control over our life. Studies have shown that music can be an important mood lifter in such situations. Music also plays a great role in making us feel less nervous or worried. Anxiety can often cause loss of sleep and other illnesses. Music is often known as an international language. We may not know the language another person is speaking, but most of us respond to music in the same way. Music can often be the best way to connect with someone. Music is one of the best ways to improve your moods, but this can depend largely on the kind of music you listen to. While happy music can certainly make you feel better, sad music can further lower your spirits. Listening to classical music can often make you feel a lot more powerful, while soft music can be the perfect way to relax at the end of a long way. If you want to use music to change the way how you are feeling, you need to understand the role of it, learn to recognize the kind of music that lifts your mood and helps you feel better. Once you realize the kind of music you can use, you can use it to change the way you feel. The right kind of music can be the perfect way to help us feel happier.	['make customers feel good']

You may already know your career path or you may have no idea at all of what you want to do. Both situations are fine! If you are diligent, the right opportunity will be ready for you. Young adulthood means greater freedom and more choices. You will probably begin to want to do things independently of your family/ care-givers. Try not to shut your family out of your life and remember to be considerate even though you are older and are capable of looking after yourself. Your family have been with you since you came into this world and they will be around you when you leave this world. It is also perfectly natural in this time of transition to want to spend more time with your friends than your family. Choose your friends wisely. Real friends are rarer than hen's teeth. A true friend will stand with you, whatever the circumstances are. This period of transition is a part of the circle of life. There are some people who will be with you throughout the life's journey and there will be some people with whom you part and go separate ways. Leaving school/college can be hard. The reality is that you may not ever see all of your classmates again. Sure, there may be reunions and you will keep in touch with some of them. But the fact is you will need to leave some of them behind as you move forwards on the path that you feel is right for you.	['reunions with schoolmates are not within the foreseeable future']
Which of the following is NOT TRUE about Edgar Allan Poe?	"Throughout the centuries, various writers have contributed greatly to the literary treasure trove of books lining the shelves of today's libraries. In addition to writing interesting material, many famous writers, such as Edgar Allan Poe, were larger-than-life characters with personal histories that are as interesting to read as the stories they wrote. Poe's rocky life included being driven off from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1831 and an ongoing battle with alcohol. Yet, despite heavy gambling debts, poor health, and terrible unemployment, Poe managed to produce a body of popular works, including ""The Raven"" and ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue."" Herman Melville, author of Moby Dick, once lived among the man-eaters in the Marquesas Islands and wrote unusual tales inspired by his years of service in the U.S. Navy. Dublin-born Oscar Wilde was noted for his charismatic personality, his outrageous lifestyle, and creating witty catchphrases such as, ""Nothing succeeds like excess."" D.H. Lawrence wrote shameful novels that were often cut, and Anne Rice led a double life writing bestselling horrible novels under her real name and using ""A.N. Roquelaure"" for the lowbrow unhealthy novels she penned on the side. Nonconformist author and naturalist Henry David Thoreau once fled to the woods and generated enough interesting material to fill his noted book Walden. Thoreau wrote on the issue of passive resistance protest in his essay ""Civil Disobedience"" and served time in jail for refusing tax payments in protest of the United States government's policy towards slavery. American short story writer O. Henry's color1ful life was ruined by tragic events, such as being accused and sentenced for stealing money from an Austin, Texas bank. Despite his success selling his short stories, O. Henry struggled financially and was nearly bankrupt when he died. As diverse as these famous authors' backgrounds were, they all led unconventional lives while writing great literary works that will endure throughout the ages. The next time you read an interesting book, consider learning more about the author by reading his or her biography so you can learn about the unique life experiences that shaped his or her writing."

What's the best title for this passage?	A taxi hit a truck. A policeman spoke to the taxi driver and to the truck driver. He also spoke to Tom. He was a witness . This is what they said. TRUCK DRIVER: I was driving from the airport to Newton. A car crossed the road, so I slowed down. I did not stop. A taxi hit the back of my truck. Nobody was badly hurt but both cars were damaged. TAXI DRIVER: I was driving behind a truck a few kilometers from Newton. The truck stopped suddenly. The driver did not give me a warning. I was driving very slowly. I could not pass the truck because there were two cars coming near from Newton. My taxi hit the truck, and some glass cut my left hand. TOM: I was watching the traffic about a kilometer from the airport. A truck was going to Newton. It was not going very quickly. There was a taxi about two hundred meters behind the truck. It was going fast. When the truck slowed down, the taxi hit it. The taxi driver was not looking at the truck. He was looking out of the window at something. My friend saw the accident, too.

The breakthrough of the writer's treatment came when _ .	Growing up, I knew I was different. My father had left and he never came back. As I later discovered, the abandonment triggered my anxiety attacks. I feared being alone, unwanted, unpopular, and unloved. My first attack came in a ninth-grade class: The teacher asked me to walk in front of the class, but I couldn't do it- I was soaked in sweat, shaking. My symptoms began every morning from the moment when I stepped inside the school building. Throughout my childhood, I was no stranger to the doctor's office. My mother tried everything she could in hope of a breakthrough. There were times I thought suicide could be the only way to make the pain stop. By age 16, I had shut down socially. Most of my peers were going to parties, playing sports, and dating. But I was a prisoner in my own home. Then one Sunday morning, my wake-up call came from a magazine article. Freddie Prinze, Jr. was on the cover. The article detailed the pain of losing his father at a young age. I felt as though I were reading my own life story. The only difference? He was now a success. That article inspired me to explore a new treatment option for myself. I wanted to turn my life around as well. So I hit the library and the Internet, and I began to realize how my negative thoughts controlled my physical well-being. Immediately, I made a plan to take charge of my life. Shortly after following the items I had listed, I was able to stop seeing a therapist. I never returned to high school, but I did go to college. After graduation, I pursued a career in television news. My relationships have changed for the better, too. I've made new friends and reconnected with many from my past The anxiety isn't completely gone, but whenever it returns, I know the feeling will pass, and know I have the power to change my life, only if I will give myself a chance.

The writer will agree with the opinion that _	Successful students have good study habits. They have these habits in all of their lessons. Read about each study habit. Work to develop any study habit you do not have. Try not to do too much studying at one time. If you try to do too much studying at one time, you will get tired easily and your studying will not be very effective. Taking short breaks will help get back your mental energy. Try to study at the same times each day. Studying at the same times each day makes it become a regular part of your life, just like sleeping and eating. When a study time comes up during the day, you will be mentally prepared to begin studying. Set clear goals for their study times. Goals will help you stay focused and check your progress. Simply sitting down to study has little value. You must be very clear about what you want to get during your study time. Start studying when planned You may not start your studying on time because you don't like a task or think it is too hard. If you do this, you are _ . If you procrastinate for any reason, you will find it difficult to get everything done when you need to. You may rush to make up the time you wasted getting started, resulting in careless work and mistakes. Work on the task they find most difficult first. Your most difficult task will require the most effort. Start with your most difficult task since this is when have the most mental energy. Review their notes before beginning a task. Reviewing your notes can help you make sure you are doing a task correctly. Also, your notes may include information that will help you complete a task. Review their schoolwork over the weekend.

"Who did the first American ""diner"" serve?"	"Many people like to eat out because they can eat quickly and the food is not expensive. Some families go to fast food restaurants. But in the past people went to diners. Do you want to know the story of the first American diner? In 1872, a man named Walter Scott had the first ""diner"". It was not really a diner. It was only a simple food cart . People on the street walked up to the cart to buy food. The cart served late-night workers who wanted a cup of coffee and a late night meal. The meal was a sandwich or boiled eggs. In 1887, Samuel Messer Jones built the first big enough diner to allow customers to come inside. However, they had no chairs to sit down. Three years later, people built diners with counters and stools and people sat down while they were eating. Before long, many diners stayed open around the clock. In other words, people were able to eat in a diner at any time. Diners changed in other ways, too. The earliest menu which only included sandwiches and coffee became bigger. Soup and dishes were added to the menu, and a breakfast menu appeared, too. In addition, diners were no longer carts on wheels. Diners today are usually buildings with large windows, shining counters and stools, tables and chairs, where people can eat all three meals."	['Late-night workers.']
What is mainly described in the passage?	The year is 2094. It has been announced that a comet is heading towards the Earth. Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the Earth. On 17 July, a piece four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion. About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the sea bed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards from the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned. Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes are set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. Could it really happen? Will we meet the same end?	['An event of imagination.']

She sat down beside him.""You're always playing on the computer. You spend more time on this machine than on your homework. "" Today more and more families have computers. Parents hope computers can help their children improve their study at school. But many of their children use computers to play games and watch videos instead of studying. We often see that computer net bars are crowded with people, especially young boys. They spend a lot of money competing with the computerized machines. The more they lose, the more they want to win. The result is that they don't want to work or study. In some countries, even scientists hate computers. They say computers cause millions of people to lose their jobs or cause them a lot of trouble. Computer game addiction is a serious problem in social life. Something has to be done to solve the problem."	['She felt worried.']
People infected with the influenza A(H7N9) virus may suffer from _ .	About influenza A(H7N9) virus What is the influenza A(H7N9) virus? Influenza A H7 viruses are a group of influenza viruses that normally spread among birds. The influenza A(H7N9) virus is one smaller group among the larger group of H7 viruses. Although some H7 viruses (H7N2, H7N3 and H7N7) have sometimes been found to infect humans, no human infections with H7N9 viruses have been reported until recent reports from China. What are the main signs of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus? So far, most patients with this infection have had severe pneumonia . Signs include fever, cough and shortness of breath. However, information is still limited about the full area of disease that infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus might cause. How did people become infected with the influenza A(H7N9) virus? Some of the confirmed cases had connections with animals or with an animal environment. The virus has been found in a pigeon in a market in Shanghai. It is not yet known how persons became infected. The possibility of animal-to-human spread is being looked into. Is it safe to eat meat like chicken and pork products? Influenza viruses are not spread through eating well-cooked food. Because influenza viruses are made inactive by normal temperatures used for cooking (so that food reaches 70degC in all parts), it is safe to eat properly prepared and cooked meat. Diseased animals and animals that have died of diseases should not be eaten. In areas experiencing outbreaks, meat products can be safely eaten only if they are properly cooked and properly handled during food preparation. The eating of raw meat and uncooked blood-based dishes is a high-risk practice and should be discouraged. Is it safe to travel to China? The number of confirmed cases in China is very low. WHO does not advise the application of any travel measures with respect to visitors to China, nor to persons leaving China. Are Chinese products safe? There is no evidence to link the present cases with any Chinese products. WHO advises that people should not fear to trade them at this time.	['hard breathing']
According to the text, the researchers think that _ .	"As more people use smart phones to pay bills and store personal information, strict password security has become more important than ever. A new study shows that free - form gestures - sweeping fingers in shapes across the screen of a smart phone--can be used to unlock phones. These gestures are less likely to be observed and reproduced by others than traditional typed passwords. ""All that it takes to steal a password is a quick eye,"" said one of the researchers of the study. ""With all the personal information we have on our phones today, improving their security is becoming increasingly necessary."" In developing a secure solution to this problem, the researchers studied the practicality of using free - form gestures. With the ability to create any shape in any size and location on the screen, the gestures were popular as passwords. Since users create them without following a template, the researchers predicted these gestures would allow for greater complexity. The researchers carried out a create - test - retest experiment where 63 people were asked to create a gesture, recall it, and recall it again 10 days later. The gestures were captured on a recognizer system designed by the team. Using this data, they tested the complexity and accuracy of each gesture using information theory. The result of their analysis is that people are favorable to use free - form gestures as passwords. To put their analysis into practice, the researchers then had seven students in computer science and engineering, each with considerable experience with touchscreens , attempt to steal a free - form gesture password by observing a phone user secretly. None of them were able to copy the gestures with enough accuracy. The gestures appear to be extremely powerful against attacks. Though the testing is in its early stage and widespread adaptation of this technology is not yet clear, the research team plans to continue to analyze the security and management of free - form passwords in the future. They believe this is the first study to explore free - form gestures as passwords. They will soon publish their findings."	['better ways of setting passwords should be developed']
What does Moore think of the search for endangered amphibians?	"Have you seen a yellow-and-black salamander ? How about a scarlet frog? Scientists haven't spotted either species in more than 20 years. What happened to them? Are the creatures still out there, or are they extinct? Those are questions that scientists hope to answer. They recently set out around the world in search of those and other long-missing amphibians. An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Frog, toads , and salamanders are amphibians. The experts are looking for about 100 species. They are searching at least 14 countries on five continents. They will look for the salamander in North America. They hope to find the scarlet frog in South America. They're also looking for species in Africa, Asia and Australia. Scientists are hopeful that they'll find the amphibians--and soon! If the creatures are out there, they may need help. Many amphibians are endangered. The animals face many dangers including pollution and diseases. People cut down the forests where they live. ""If researchers can find the missing creatures, they might be able to figure out how to save them,"" explains expert Robin Moore. He began searching for the amphibians earlier this month. ""This search will tell us a lot about how amphibians are doing,"" Moore told WR News. ""I don't know what we will find, but that makes the search even more exciting."" Lost in the Wild Scientists' hunt for missing amphibians is under way. Read about some of the species they hope to find. Turkestanian salamander This salamander is a mystery to scientists. Experts found a few of them more than 100 years ago, but none have been seen ever since. Gastric brooding frog Experts first discovered this frog in 1914 in eastern Australia. It may be extinct because of disease and habitat loss. Rio Pescado stubfoot toad Last sighting: 1995, in South America Scientists hope to find this spotted toad in rivers and rainforests in Ecuador. The animal faces threats including pollution and disease."	"[""It's interesting.""]"
Which of the following statements most probably agrees with Dawna Markova's view?	"Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on auto-pilot and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. ""Not choice, but habit rules the unreflecting creatures,"" William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In the ever-changing 21st century, even the word ""habit"" carries a negative meaning. So it seems contradictory to talk about habits in the same context as innovation . But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop new habits, we create parallel paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks. Rather than dismissing ourselves as unchangeable creatures of habit, we can instead direct our own change by consciously developing new habits. In fact, the more new things we try, the more creative we become. But don't bother trying to kill off old habits; once those _ of procedure are worn into the brain, they're there to stay. Instead, the new habits we deliberately press into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads. ""The first thing needed for innovation is attraction to wonder,"" says Dawna Markova, author of The Open Mind. ""But we are taught instead to 'decide', just as our president calls himself 'the Decider'."" She adds, however, that ""to decide is to kill off all possibilities but one. A good innovational thinker is always exploring the many other possibilities."" ""All of us work through problems in ways of which we're unaware,"" she says. Researchers in the late 1960s discovered that humans are born with the ability to approach challenges in four primary ways: analytically, procedurally , collaboratively and innovatively. At the end of adolescence, however, the brain shuts down half of that ability, preserving only those ways of thought that have seemed most valuable during the first decade or so of life. The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, meaning that few of us use our innovative and collaborative ways of thought. ""This breaks the major rule in the American belief system--that anyone can do anything,"" explains M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book This Year I Will ... and Ms. Markova's business partner. ""That's a lie that we have preserved, and it fosters commonness. Knowing what you're good at and doing even more of it creates excellence."" This is where developing new habits comes in."

This passage mainly tells us about _ .	Language students often think they have memory problems. They worry because they can't remember words. In fact, the problem usually isn't with their memory. The problem is with how they study. To remember words better, you need to understand how memory works. There are two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. When you see, hear, or read something, it goes first into short-term memory. But short-term memory lasts for only a few seconds. You will only remember something longer if it goes into long-term memory. Y _ . How can you do this with vocabulary? The answer is to work with the word and think about the word in new ways. You can do this by writing new sentences that include it. Even better, you can invent a little story about the word, with people or places that you know. Another way is to make a picture in your mind with the word. For example, if the word is height, you can think of the tallest person you know and try to guess his or her height. All of these activities are good ways to think about words. They make the meaning of words stronger in your long-term memory. And they give a way to find a word when you need it.

What does the guide dog learn to do during the training?	Guide dogs help blind people who cannot get around by themselves.Although Yorkshire terriers and poodles are good companion dogs,guide dogs are chosen from lager breeds such as German shepherds,golden retrievers,and Labrador retrievers.The young dogs are raised by families until they are eighteen months old.During this time,they get lots of love and attention,but they are also taught to obey.Then the dogs go to a special school where,for four months,they work with a sighted trainer,an individual who can see.The dog forms a close relationship with this person who teaches it how to follow directions such as right,left,straight ahead,and stop.The young dog also learns to watch out for dangerous traffic and wait until it is safe to cross a busy street. When the dog is two years old,it starts training with the blind person it will live with. The dog and its new owner make many trips from downtown to where the blind person lives so the dog becomes familiar with the normal atmosphere.During the training,a sighted trainer always remains with them. A blind person who is getting a guide dog for the first time will train for about a month. If the individual has had a dog before,the training takes about three weeks.After the training,the blind person depends on the guide dog for between seven and twelve years.At that point,the working dog become a family pet and the owner needs to train with a younger guide dog.

From the passage we can learn that Pure Brightness Festival in 2014 will be on _ .	"Pure Brightness Festival, also known as Tomb-sweeping Day in China, falls on the 4thor 5thof April each year. It was started in the Han Dynasty. On this day, whole families, young and old, with flowers visit the graves of their ancestors to pay their respects. Following the custom, tomb sweepers clean and tidy the graves, decorate them with flowers. They burn paper money made for the dead, set off firecrackers and bow before their ancestors' tombstones. On this day, they don't cook. Only cold food is served. However, tomb sweeping is not the only activity during Pure Brightness Festival. This day is also a time for people to enjoy themselves. Other activities include spring outing, flying kites, planting trees, tasting tea and so on. In April, everything in nature takes on a new look. Trees turn green, flowers come out and the sun shines brightly. So it is a good time to be out to appreciate the beauty of nature. People fly kites not only in the daytime but at night. In the dark, some people fly kites with lanterns, which are called ""God's lanterns"". They plant trees because young trees which are planted during this period are easy to grow up. And they enjoy tea because the tea produced around the festival is said to have good quality."	['either April 4 or April 5']
Which of the following should take the blame for the bad eating habit?	"After moving to the United States, immigrant groups trying to fit in tend to choose high-calorie, fatty foods in an attempt to appear more American, a new study finds. That's one reason why immigrants approach U.S. levels of obesity within 15 years of moving to America. The researchers also did an experiment that measured whether or not the threat of appearing un-American influenced respondents' food choices.After being questioned about their ability to speak English,75 percent of Asian-Americans identified a typical American food as their favorite. Only 25 percent of Asian-Americans who had not been asked if they spoke English did the same. When their American identity was called into question during a follow-up study, Asian-American participants also tended to choose typical American dishes, such as hamburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches, over more Asian fare. In that experiment, 55 Asian-Americans were asked to choose a meal from a local Asian or American restaurant. Some participants were told that only Americans could participate in the study. Those who chose the more typical American _ ended up consuming an extra 182 calories, including 12 grams of fat and seven grams of saturated fat . ""People who feel like they need to prove they belong in a culture will change their habits in an attempt to fit in,"" said Sapna Cheryan, an author of the study and assistant professor of psychology at the University of Washington. ""If immigrants and their children choose unhealthy American foods over healthier traditional foods across their lives, this process of fitting in could lead to poorer health,"" Cheryan added. Social pressures, the study concluded, are at the heart of the problem. ""In American society today, being American is associated with being white. Americans who don't fit this image even if they were born here and speak English feel that pressure to prove that they're American,"" said Cheryan."	['The pressures from society']
The children didn't have to go to school because _ .	Our first winter in Canada was the happiest we have experienced. We were living in the countryside then and had just arrived from Hong Kong that autumn. One evening in mid December snow began to fall. When we looked out of the window and saw that it was snowing, we all cheered. It was the first snow we had ever seen and we were excited. We could hardly wait for the snow to stop so that we could go out to play. Next morning when we woke up, it was still snowing. We switched on the radio and learned that more than ten inches of snow had falled during the night and that since the roads were blocked there would be no school that day. We jumped up and down for joy and begged mother to let us go outside to play in the snow. She said we could go out after breakfast if we dressed ourselves warmly and promised to come back as soon as we felt cold. When we went out, the snow had almost stopped. The roads , paths, gardens, and playing grounds were all hidden under a white blanket of soft snow. It was the most beautiful sight we had ever seen. Just then, we saw some neighbour's children coming out to play. We ran over to join them. Together we built a snowman and a snow house. After that, we took turns sliding down a hill on a large piece of cardboard. We were having so much fun when supper time came. Mother almost had to force us to go in and eat.

The author wrote this text _ .	"It was the day after Halloween when my grandmother was admitted to the hospital with the worst headache she'd ever had. While posing in our costumes the night before, we knew something was wrong, just not how wrong. Grandma's house was the central gathering place of my family. Sunday lunches, birthday dinners, Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas -- all were our traditions, with her as hostess. While my parents were busy running their small business, there were many nights when Grandma fed me and put me to bed in her spare room, until they came to get me. I spent my summers at Grandma's and I went everywhere with her. I couldn't imagine a time when she wouldn't be around me. Then November 1, 1991 began her month-long stay in the hospital--she suffered from a rare infection called nocardia asteroides. After being born in the year of the Great Depression, living through World War II, raising three kids, and being widowed at the age of 48, Grandma never expected to live into her seventies. The infection in her brain seemed to confirm that she wasn't long for this world. But that's not the end of her story. A team of doctors successfully removed the abscess , and Grandma even made it into a local medical journal. Her doctor called her ""the brain lady"". Grandma celebrated her 85thbirthday in March this year. In the almost 23 years since her recovery, she's seen two of her four grandchildren get married and welcomed three great-grandsons. Although they damage something in her house, she loves it when my two boys come over. And while I know they make her day, seeing her love blossom for another generation makes my day too. Happy Grandparents' Day to my amazing grandmother!"	['in honor of Grandma']
The streets will be less crowded because _ .	A kind of little cars may take the place of today's big ones many years later. If everyone drives such cars in the future, there will be less pollution in the air. There will also be more space for parking in cities, and the streets will be less crowded. The little cars of the future will cost less. Driving will be safer, too, since these little cars can go only 65 kilometers an hour. The cars of the future will be fine for going around a city, but they will not be useful for a long way. Little cars will go 450 kilometers before they need to stop for more gasoline . If big cars are still used with the small ones, two kinds of roads will be needed in the future. Some roads will be needed for the big, faster cars and other roads will be needed for the small, slower ones. ,.	['future cars will be smaller']
According to the passage, which of the following is true?	On October 12, 1987, some Chinese scientists were working at the computers to look for information they needed. Suddenly they saw a lot of very bright spots( )crossing the computers' screens. At the same time the computers were working much slower. To find out what was happening they stopped their work to check some parts of the computers. To their horror , they found out that most of their stored information was got rid of( ) by computer viruses! Obviously all these computers had been infected( ) by computer viruses. It is said that the computer viruses were made by a group of young man fond of playing tricks. They all had excellent education. They created the viruses just to show their intelligence. These kinds of computer viruses are named Jerusalem( )Viruses. These viruses can stay in computers for a long time. When the time comes they will attack the computers by lowering the function , damaging their normal programs or even getting rid of all the information. We now come to know that Jerusalem Viruses often attack computers on Fridays and that they are spreading to a list of computers. Among the countries that suffering computer viruses are Britain, Australia, Switzerland and the U.S. But till now, how to get rid of the terrible remains a problem.

The writer's advice is _ .	"Do you sometimes argue about what seems to you to be a simple fact ? Do you argue whether it's cold outdoors or whether the car in front of you is going faster than the speed limit ? If you get into such arguments, try to think about the story about the six blind men and the elephant.The first blind man who felt the elephant's trunk said it was like a snake.The second who felt the elephant's side said it was like a wall, while the third said it was like a spear as he touched the animal's tusk.The fourth, who had hold of the elephant's tail insisted that it was like a rope.The fifth man said it looked like a tree as he put his arm around one the elephant's legs. The sixth, who was tall and got hold of the elephant's ears, said it was like a huge fan. Each man's idea of the animal came from his own experience.So if someone disagrees with you about a ""simple fact"", it's often because his experience in the matter is different from yours. To see how hard it is for even one person to make up his mind about a ""simple fact"", try this simple experiment.Get three large bowls.Put ice water in one.Put hot water in the second.Put lukewarm water in the third.Now put your left hand in the ice water.Put your right hand in the hot water.After thirty seconds, put both hands in the lukewarm water.Your right hand will tell you the water is cold.Your left hand will tell you it's hot !"

If a black man married a white woman 50years ago, the worst result was that _ .	"For generations here in the deepest South, there had been a great taboo : publicly crossing the color line for love. Less than 45 years ago, marriage between blacks and whites was illegal, and it has been forbidden for much of the time since. So when a great job about an hour's drive north of the Gulf Coast attracted him, Jeffrey Norwood, a black college basketball coach, had reservations. He was in a _ relationship with a woman who was white and Asian. ""You're thinking about a life in South Mississippi?"" his father said in a skeptical voice, recalling days when a black man could face mortal danger just being seen with a woman of another race, regardless of intentions. ""Are you sure?"" But on visits to Hattiesburg, the younger Mr. Norwood said he liked what he saw: growing diversity. So he moved, married, and, with his wife, had a baby girl, who was counted on the last census as black, white and Asian. Taylor Rae Norwood, three, is one of thousands of mixed-race children who have made this state home to one of the nation's most rapidly expanding multiracial populations, up 70 percent between 2000 and 2010, according to new data from the Census Bureau. In the first comprehensive accounting of multiracial Americans since statistics were first collected about them in 2000, reporting from the 2010 census, made public in recent days, shows that the nation's mixed-race population is growing far more quickly than many researchers had estimated, particularly in the South and parts of the Midwest. That conclusion is based on the bureau's analysis of 42 states; the data from the remaining eight states will be released soon. In North Carolina, the mixed-race population doubled. In Georgia, it grew by more than 80 percent, and by nearly as much in Kentucky and Tennessee. In Indiana, Iowa and South Dakota, the multiracial population increased by about 70percent. Census officials estimated the national multiracial growth rate was about 35 percent since2000 according to the known result, when seven million people ----- 2.4 percent of the population chose more than one race."

It can be inferred that Colin's sister hoped that Colin would _ .	"There are many idioms in English. An idiom is a phrase that we can't understand from the meaning of each word. The following are some of them. As the crow flies When a bird flies from place to place, it takes the most direct route. But when people drive, they have to follow roads and often go farther. When people give a distance ""as the crow flies"", they mean the shortest distance between the two points, not the distance you would have to travel by following roads. As Dan and his mum drove along the river, they could see the beach on the opposite side. Dan asked ""How far is it to the beach?"" ""It's only about a quarter of a mile as the crow flies"" his mother said. Blow hot and cold In one of Aesop's Fables, a man blows on his fingers to warm them up and then blows on his soup to cool it down. In both cases, the man is opening his mouth, but what comes out is different. If a person says one thing and later says the opposite, we say that the person is blowing hot and cold. ""Is Felicia going to try out for the soccer team this year?"" Stacy asked. ""I don't know,"" Tricia replied."" Last week she was saying yes, but this week she's saying no. She's really blowing hot and cold."" Break the ice Nowadays people use the phrase to refer to ending an awkward silence by beginning a conversation. It was the first day of summer camp. The four girls began to make their beds in silence. None of the girls knew each other, and no one knew what to say. Finally, one of them broke the ice by saying"" Hey, where's everybody from?"" Bury the hatchet In native American culture, when two nations agreed to end their war, they buried the hatchet. So to bury the hatchet is to make peace with someone else. Colin could not excuse his sister for breaking his tennis racket. Finally, his sister said, ""Colin, can't we bury the hatchet?"""	['forgive her mistake']
The text is most likely to be read _ .	This is not a diet. It's a simple way to lose weight. You don't have to give up the food you love or join a gym. You just follow some habits thin people have. Keep them, and you'll become thin. *Wake-up When you wake up in the morning, sit up slowly without using your hands. With legs straight out, lean forward until you feel sore in your back. It will use up 10 calories. *Start with soup Order a clear soup, and have it before the main food. In this way, you'll feel fuller, so you'll eat less when the main food comes. *An apple or more a day Apples are full of fiber and water, so your stomach will want less. Studies show that people who eat at least three apples or pears a day may lose weight. *Talk it up Every time you use the cell phone, stand up and walk around. Heavy people sit on average two and a half hours more each day than thin people. This skill is very important and standing up and walking around will burn up 50 or more calories. Use these skills, and you will have a big weight loss.	['in a magazine']

Which of the following is WRONG about the young woman?	"A young woman was diagnosed with a terminal illness and given three months to live. So as she was getting her things ""in order"", she asked her pastor to come to her house to discuss her final wishes. With everything in order, the pastor was ready to leave when the young woman suddenly remembered something very important to her. ""What's that?"" asked the pastor. ""I want to be buried with a fork in my right hand."" The pastor stood looking at the young woman, not knowing what to say. ""That surprises you, doesn't it?"" the young woman asked. ""Well, to be honest, I'm puzzled by the request,"" said the pastor. The young woman explained, ""In all my years of going to church meetings and dinners, I remember that when the dishes of the main course were being cleared, someone would always lean over and say, 'Keep your fork.' It was my favorite part because I knew that something better was coming, like chocolate cake or apple pie,some dessert like that. Something wonderful! I just want people to see me there in that casket with a fork so that when they ask you why I have a fork, you can tell them: 'Keep your fork--the best is yet to come.'"" The pastor hugged the young woman good-bye. He knew that the young woman had a better grasp of heaven than he did. She had a better grasp of what heaven would be like than many people twice her age, with twice as much experience and knowledge. At the funeral people were walking by the young woman's casket and they saw the pretty dress she was wearing and the fork placed in her right hand. Over and over, the pastor heard the question ""Why does she have a fork?"" And over and over again he smiled. So the next time you reach down for your fork, let it reminded you of this young woman gently. Send the message to everyone you consider a friend even if it means sending it back to the person who sent it to you. And, keep your fork!!"	['She wants her friends to remember her forever.']

What changed James' view towards life?	In one of the old buildings near our school,one could see an old man sitting by a large window on the first floor.His name was James.During the three years at schoo1, I had hardly ever found him missing from his usual position. He was a high-ranking government official and lived happily with his wife.Once there was a bus accident,in which a number of passengers were seriously injured and were taken to the hospital for treatment.James was responsible for the rescue operation.It was a big hospital,but James was shocked to notice how ill-equipped it was.There were no enough life-saving drugs and life--supporting equipment. The injured and their companions had to struggle there.James attempted to help.However,though he emptied his pockets,many of them died that day. That was a turning point in his life.He made a decision to devote his life to helping others, particularly the poor and needy patients and their companions.He began spending much of his income on these people.Since this required a lot of time and energy,he found it difficult to fulfill his official duties and therefore chose to retire,which,in turn,reduced his income considerably. His wife was deeply worried. Most of the time,James was out and paid least attention to home affairs.Meanwhile,as he was spending a lot helping others,she had to struggle even to meet the household expenses.Though she was not opposed to his helping the poor,she urged him not to overlook his own life and home,but it had no effect on him.One day they had a heated argument and in the end she left him,never to return.Though he continued with his work, _ was a great blow and did serious harm to his health and enthusiasm and was soon forced to stay indoors.That was when he took his position by the window,spending his time looking outside. A few weeks after my graduation,I returned to school,only to find the buildings gone.I heard that they were torn down.All the people left except James.He refused to go and the next morning,he was found at his usual place by the window,dead.

Why did Joyce often buy a doll for her as a birthday present every year?	"Amy was looking for a gift for her little daughter. Suddenly she stopped before a store of dolls.

When Amy was a little girl, she got her first doll from Joyce for her birthday. Then the second, the third...A doll a year from Joyce never arrived late. ""Why always a doll?""

Which of the following is TURE according to the passage?	"Ask any student which subject he or she hates most. 9 out of 10 students will answer ""math"". No matter which country you visit, no matter which grade you are in, you may not learn art, geography, chemistry or Chinese, but you always learn math. Why is this so? How come so many students hate math, and yet cannot avoid learning it in school? Jenny Sanders, a high school student in California, asks, ""What good do we get from learning math? We can use computers to compute numbers, and we can use computers to store information. I think learning math at school is a waste of time."" However, there is much more to math than just learning to add and subtract numbers. In fact, math is not so much about calculation as it is about learning to think logically and solving problems. Of course, Jenny was right that we can use computers to do calculations, but how would we even know how to use the computer if we can't think logically? In short, computers are only tools when solving problems. For example, imagine you are a cook and must serve dinner to 100 guests. How should you divide your resources so that you can get the job done most efficiently ? In situations like this, the ability to think logically will get you to a reasonable answer and solve your problem."	['90%of the students hate learning math.']
Which of the following is right according to Peggy Blumenthal?	"China is now sending more college students to study in the United States than any other country. A new report shows a 23 percent increase in the number of Chinese students coming to the U.S. The latest edition of the annual Institute of International Education(IIE)and another US institute found a 5 percent rise in the number of international university students in the US compared to one year ago. There are now over 157, 000 Chinese students at U.S. colleges and universities. Aisa accounted for four of the top five countries and regions to take advantage of the US higher education system. ""Increased numbers of students from China, particularly at the undergraduate level, largely accounts for the growth this past year,"" the report stated. ""They really enroll in a full range of US higher education,"" said Peggy Blumenthal, senior counselor to the president of IIE, the group that made the report. ""20 years ago, students from China only knew of a handful of US insitiutions, but now, they are enrolling in our community colleges, in our small liberal arts institutions, in the research universities. Really spread across the country,"" she said. Chinese mainland was in the number one spot, while India was the number two country of origin. South Korea was third and Canada was number four. China's Taiwan held the number five spot. Saudi Arabia was in sixth with a 44-percent increase, while Japan was seventh, down 14 percent. Blumenthal attributes the increase in the number of Chinese students heading to US colleges to limited university places in China, as well as a feeling from students and their parents than they want a ""unique"" educational experience. China's family planning policy, says Blumenthal, has also meant that families can concentrated resources on a single child. The University of California at Los Angeles has one of the largest Asian student populations of any college in the United States."

What is the author's aim in writing this passage?	I am not just a successful architect . I also like to play the piano. In my spare time I often turn some dry musical symbols into beautiful music. Many years ago, while I was in a university studying architecture, I worked in a workshop. During the break I found an old piano in the corner of the room. With the allowance of the boss I sat down to have a try. Following my fingers the keys danced brilliantly and at the same time beautiful music flew out and then to every part of the room. All my workmates suddenly stopped talking and made their ears ready for my music. After graduation, I began to devote myself to my profession. All my musical talent was wasted into zero. Then one evening we went to a concert at which Mr. Stevenson, one of the ordinary workers in my company, sang us some beautiful songs. His musical talents made us all surprised. We all enjoyed ourselves with his beautiful voice so much that we even thought him a professional singer. I was also reminded of my musical talent. I began to train in a training center. My teacher was strict with me. He encouraged me to train every weekend and each time he asked me to play better than the last. Now I can proudly say I am also a successful pianist because every time I played on the stage fresh flowers and warm clapping would come from my audience. So I say, my friends, don't busy yourself with your work too much. Find some time to develop your potential talent and your life will become more wonderful.

Which of the following statements is True according to the passage?	"Bringing a giraffe into the world is _ . A baby giraffe is born 10 feet high and usually lands on its back. Within seconds it rolls over its legs under its body. Then the mother giraffe rudely introduces its children to the reality of life. In his book,A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson. The mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling . When it doesn't get up, the process is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time on its shaky legs. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off its feet again. Why? She wants it to remember how it got up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety. Another writer named Irving Stone understood this. He spent a lifetime studying greatness, writing stories about such men as Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin. Stone was once asked if he had found something that runs through the lives of all these great people. He said, ""I write about people who sometime in their life have a dream of something. They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere. But every time they stand up again. And at the end of their lives they've realized some small parts of what they set out to do ."""	['Irving Stone spent a lifetime studying and writing stories about great people.']
While meeting with Alec, Rebecca feels _ during the whole course.	"A tall figure appeared from the dark door of the tent. It was a smoking young man about twenty three or four. He had an almost black face, though smooth. His moustache was black with curled points. There was an unusual force in his face, and in his daring rolling eyes. cef Rebecca still stood hesitating like a swimmer about to make his dive, hardly knowing whether to return or move forward. ""Hi, my beauty, what can I do for you?"" said he, approaching. Realizing that she was quite at a loss, the man spoke in a gentle voice, ""Never mind. I am Mr. Thackeray. Have you come to see me or my mother?"" This scene differed greatly from what Rebecca had expected. She had dreamed of an aged and dignified face. She told herself to be calm and answered ""I came to see your mother, sir."" ""I am afraid you cannot see her-she is ill in bed,"" replied the representative of the house; for this was Mr. Alee Thackeray, the only son of the noble family. ""What is the business you wish to see her about?"" ""It isn't business-it is-I can hardly say what!"" ""Pleasure?"" ""Oh no. Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem..."" Rebecca's sense of a certain ridicule(,) was now so obvious and strong that, despite her general discomfort at being here, her rosy lips curved towards a smile, much to the attraction of the young man. ""It is so foolish"", she murmured. ""I fear I can't tell you!"" ""Never mind; I like foolish things. Try again, my dear,"" said he kindly. ""Mother told me to come,"" Rebecca continued; ""and, indeed, I was in the mind to do so myself. But I did not expect it would turn out like this. I came...sir, I came to tell you that we are of the same family as you."" ""Ho Ho! Poor relations?"" ""Yes."" ""Rossetti?"" ""No. Thackeray."" ""Ay, ay; I mean Thackeray."" ""Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield; but we have several proofs that we are Thackeray. The local scholars hold the view that we are, and...and we have an old seal and a silver spoon marked with the same castle as yours.

"When did the author get in touch with ""Information, Please"" again after he moved to Boston?"	"When I was quite young, I discovered that somewhere inside the telephone lived an amazingperson - ""Information Please"" and there was nothing she did not know. One day while my mother was out, I hit my finger with a hammer. The pain was terrible, but there was no one home to give me any sympathy. I walked around the house, finally arriving at the telephone! Quickly, I called ""Information Please"" and told her what happened. She told me to open the icebox and hold a little piece of ice to my finger. After that, I called ""Information Please"" for everything. When my pet bird died, I told ""Information Please"" the sad story. She tried to comfort me, she said quietly, ""Paul, always remember that there are other worlds to sing in."" Somehow I felt better. Another day I was on the telephone, ""How do you spell 'grateful'? "". All this took place in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. When I was 9, we moved to Boston. A few years later, on my way to college, my plane put down in Seattle. I had about half an hour or so between planes. Without thinking, I dialed my hometown operator and said, ""Information, please."" Surprisingly, I heard the small, clear voice I knew so well, ""Information."" I hadn't planned on this but I heard myself saying, ""Could you please tell me how to spell 'grateful'?"" There was a long pause. Then came the soft-spoken answer, ""I guess your finger must have healed by now."" I laughed. ""So it's really still you,"" I said, ""I wonder if you have any idea how much you meant to me during that time."" I told her how often I had thought of her over the years and asked if I could call her again. ""Please do,"" she said, ""Just ask for Sally."" Three months later I was back in Seattle. A different voice answered me. I was told that Sally passed away five weeks before. Before I could hang up she told me that Sally left a message for me--""Tell him I still say there are other worlds to sing in. He'll know what I mean."" I thanked her and hung up. I knew what Sally meant. Never underestimate the impression you may make on others. Whose life have you touched today?"	['When his plane stopped in Seattle for half an hour.']
The old man refused the boy to go fishing with him again because _ .	"He was an old man who fished alone in a small boat on the sea and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.

But after forty days without a fish, the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone with another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his boat empty. The sail looked like the flag of failure forever. The old man was thin with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck.

In which part of a magazine would you probably read the passage?	Pearl Buck(1892--1973)was born in Hillsboro, West Virginia. She grew up in China, but was educated at Randolph-Macon Woman's College. After her graduation she returned to China and lived there until 1934 with the exception of a year spent at Cornell University, where she took an MA in 1926.Pearl Buck began to write in the twenties; her first novel, East Wind; West Wind, appeared in 1930.It was followed by The Good Earth (1931),Sons(1932),and A House Divided(1935),together forming a trilogy on the stories of the family of Wang. The Good Earth stood on the American list of bestsellers for a long time and earned her several awards, including the Pulitzer Prize and the William Dean Howells Medal. She also published The first Wife and Other Stories(1933),All Men are Brothers(1933),The Mother(1934),and This Proud Heart(1938).The biographies of her mother and father, The Exile and Fighting Angel, were published in 1936 and later brought out together under the title of The Spirit and the Flesh(1944). Pearl Buck's works after 1938 are too many to speak about. Her novels have continued to deal with the differences between East and West. Her interest has spread to such countries as India and Korea. Pearl Buck was active in many charity organizations; in particular she set up an organization for the adoption of Asian-American children and took an active interest in children with low IQ.

The author moved to Canada after graduating from girls' high school because _ .	When I was born, my parents immediately noticed something wrong. My feet were deformed , pointing inward and curling under. I wore casts and foot braces in my first two years to correct the problem. Yet I learned to balance and walk in casts. Soon after the last set of casts came off,Mom enrolled me in dance classes as therapy for my feet. I, however,quickly decided to try something else. Not far from my house was an ice rink in the mall. There,local skaters would perform ice shows. I wanted to try skating. I started taking group skating lessons. Performing on ice came naturally. For me,skating has never been about beating others. It's been about being my personal best. I progressed through various levels rapidly and gave my first ice performance at age seven. Soon I started winning local and regional competitions. That's because being on the ice has always been the one place I can truly express my emotions. _ I began seriously training when I was nine years old. After graduating from girls' high school,I moved to Canada. Saying goodbye to my family and friends made me homesick,but I knew deep down that I had to leave and train full-time to give my dreams a chance at reality. I went to compete in the Olympic Games in 1992.I was the first of the final six skaters on the ice. My long performance started well,but I slipped while landing one of my easiest triple jumps,and my hand touched the ice. I didn't want to make two mistakes in a row,so next I did a jump with just two spins to play it safe. As I neared the end,I had one more jump. I landed it perfectly. When medals were awarded,I found myself on the top step,the gold hanging around my neck and America's national anthem playing. Words can't describe the overwhelming mixture of emotions I felt.

You may find this text in a magazine about _ .	"How many times do you check your Moments or Facebook page in a day to see whether your latest post has got another ""like"" or ""thumbs up""? Although you might be embarrassed to admit how many times you do this, don't worry. Psychological findings have shown it's completely normal. In fact, the pleasure we derive from getting a ""like"" is equal to that of eating chocolate or winning money, and we can't help wanting more. According to the findings of the UCLA Brain Mapping Center, which observed 32 teens aged between 13 and 18, the feedback circuit in the teens' brains are particularly sensitive, and the ""social"" and ""visual"" parts of their brains were activated when they received ""likes"" on a social network. The research also showed that though the thumbs up might come from complete strangers, the good they derive from it worked equally. So does it mean we should try our best to win as many thumbs up as possible? Not necessarily so if we know the reasons behind our desire for attention. In ""Why do people crave attention"" by M. Farouk Radwan, he explained several cases in which people naturally longed for attention. Radwan said people who were an only child, who were used to being the center of attention in their house, may try to reproduce these conditions. Feeling ""overlooked and unappreciated"" might also lead you to be eager for attention. Other times, the state of being jealous or wanting to cover your mistakes may also contribute to such longings. In fact, too much desire for attention can create anxiety, and in turn ruin your happiness even when you get it. So what can we do about it? The answer is quite simple. ""If people could adopt goals not focused on their own self-esteem but on something larger than their self, such as what they can create or contribute to others, they would be less sensitive to some of the negative effects of pursuing self-esteem,"" wrote psychology professor Jennifer Crocker in the Journal of Social Issues."

To Ben Elton , Mayall's death is rather _ .	"British actor and comedian Rik Mayall died at 56 in London . As one of the leading lights of Britain's comedy scene in the 1980s , he is best known for starring roles in hit TV series Blackadder , The Young Ones , The New Statesman and Bottom . His agent, Kate Benson told CNN Mayall died suddenly ; she did not know the cause of his death. Mayall first found widespread fame in student sitcom ""The Young Ones,"" which ran for two years on the BBC, and was later shown on MTV in the United States. The series focused on the lives of four roommates at ""Scumbag College."" Writer and comedian Ben Elton told the Press Association Mayall had "" changed his life "" by asking him to work on The Young Ones . "" He always made me cry with laughter , now he's just made me cry . "" In the 1990s, Mayall played a role in Bottom , a series about two unemployed flat mates who spend most of their time attacking each other violently with anything that comes to hand . Mayall also branched out into movies , taking the lead role in 1991's Drop Dead Fred , in which he played the imaginary friend of Phoebe Cates , returning years later to cause trouble in the now grown-up Cates' life . Mayall survived a bike accident in 1998; he was unconscious for five days after the crash, on his farm in Devon, southwest England, and developed epilepsy as a result of the severe head injury he suffered in the accident . In an interview several years later, he joked that he ""beat Jesus"" by coming back from the hell . He said the accident left him more aware of being alive. House star Hugh Laurie, who worked with Mayall on Blackadder, took to Twitter to recount a story about his co-star: ""A young girl, stricken with terminal cancer, once asked Rik Mayall for an autograph.

Could the thief find any money? _	"Balzac was a great French writer. But he was very poor before he became famous. He lived in a dirty, wet room and was often worried about food. All his friends were very poor and they could not help him. One night it was very cold. The wind blew and it was snowing heavily. Balzac went to bed early but couldn't fall asleep. He didn't get any food before he went to bed. He thought and thought, but he couldn't have a good idea. At midnight he saw a man climb in through the broken window. The man began to steal something on his bookshelf. Balzac got up quietly and said, ""Don't waste time, my friend! I couldn't find any money in the daytime. How can you find some in the dark?"""

What did Edwards see first after being struck down by a lightning?	Something strange was unbelievable. Take Robert for example. After the terrible car accident, his whole world had been completely dark and quiet for almost ten years. The loss of sight and hearing made him try many times to put end to his life. His family especially his wife did their best to tend and comfort him. By and by he finally regained the courage to live on. On a hot summer afternoon he was taking a walk with a stick near his house when a thunderstorm started suddenly. He stood under a large tree in order not to get himself wet. Unfortunately he was struck down to the ground by a lightning. The witnesses thought him dead but he woke up some 20 minutes later lying face down in muddy water below the tree. He felt that he was trembling badly, but when he opened his eyes ,he didn't dare to believe that he saw a plough( )lying near the wall. When Mrs Edwards came running up to him, she shouted their neighbours for help. And he saw her and heard her voice for the first time in nearly ten years. The news of Robert's regaining his sight and hearing quickly spread in his area. And many doctors came to prove the truth of the news. Most of them said that he gained sight and hearing again obviously from the knock of lightning; none of them could give convincing reasons, however. The only reasonable explanation given by one doctor was that, since Edwards lost his sight and hearing as a result of sudden shock in a terrible accident, perhaps the only way for them to regain was by another sudden shock.

The author develops the text mainly by _ .	"In a growing number of English classes, teachers are leaving the classic novels on the shelf and letting students select the books they read. Supporters say that the new approach, called reader's workshop, helps develop a love for reading in students who are bored by classic literature. They argue that the best way to motivate students to read more is to offer them more choices. _ , however. They worry that students who choose trendy, less challenging titles over the classics won't be exposed to the great writing and key themes of important works of literature.Student reporters Donald and Sarah express their ideas about this new approach. Donald thinks that we should turn the page. Students should be allowed to select the books they read in English class. He says he and his classmates are allowed to pick their own books in class. That makes them more focused, and they look forward to class time. Tristin, a classmate of his at Clinton Middle School agrees. ""I'm reading books that I want to read, which makes class more fun and interesting,"" he says. Offering students a choice may also improve test scores. Studies by Professor John Guthrie of the University of Maryland found that students in grades 4 through 6 who had some choices in the books they read showed improved reading comprehension skills during testing. Giving students the chance to decide what they read helps build a lifelong love for reading. Isn't that what we want for our students? Sarah holds a different view. She thinks teachers know more about books than students do. When an English teacher assigns a book, he or she keeps in mind the reading level of most students in the class. Students who choose their own books might be cheating themselves by picking books that are not up to their reading level or that are too difficult. Furthermore, a whole class can discuss a book it reads together. That makes it easier for some kids to understand what they are reading. ""The students wouldn't be able to hold a meaningful conversation if they were all reading different books,"" says Kristin, an English teacher at Fleetwood Area Middle School. ""If they read the same book, their conversations would be more in-depth."""	['making comparisons']
What can we learn from the passage?	"That warm day was the only day of the week without rain. I opened the door, took a seat and began to enjoy the wonderful sunshine. Suddenly, I noticed that the house near mine had been sold. An elderly lady was in front of the door, with some beautiful flowers beside her. I walked to her. She looked to be in her early eighties and had the prettiest white hair. ""Hi! My name is Karmen,"" I said smiling brightly at the old lady. She smiled back and said, ""Hello, Karmen. I'm Henrietta."" Her voice was very strong for someone at her age. Later, I learned she was alone and had no family or relatives to help her. From that day on, I often visited her and helped her with her housework and sometimes she gave me some delicious food. A year passed, and I considered Henrietta to be one of my best friends. One day, I walked over for my morning visit and knocked on the door, but there was no answer. I knocked again, and she still didn' t _ . So I let myself in, using the key she had given me. I checked her living room and then her kitchen. I finally went into her bedroom, and she was lying peacefully on her bed. Beside her there were two notes. One was her will, which said all that she had would be given to me. The other was a thank-you note. I went to her bedside and cried sadly. Though several years have gone by, I still miss her deeply. Whenever I look at the beautiful flowers in front of her house, I remember the wonderful friendship we had."	['The writer got on very well with the old lady.']
Which is NOT the means of Olympic flame transportation mentioned in the passage?	"The Olympic Flame from the ancient games was reintroduced during the 1928 Olympic Games. An employee of the Electric Utility of Amsterdam, lit the first Olympic flame in the Marathon Tower of theOlympic Stadiuminprefix = st1 /Amsterdam. The modern practice of moving the Olympic Flame via a relay system from Olympia to the Olympic venue began with the 1936 Summer OlympicsinBerlin,Germany. The relay, captured in Leni Riefenstahl'sfilm, ""Olympia"", was part of the Nazi propaganda machine's attempt to add myth and mystique to Adolf Hitler's regime. Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as the perfect way to illustrate his belief that classicalGreecewas an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich. Although most of the time the torch with the Olympic Flame is still carried by runners, it has been transported in many different ways. The fire traveled by boat in 1948 to cross the English Channel, and it was first transported byairplanein 1952, when the fire traveled toHelsinki. All carriers in the torch relay toStockholm, where these events were held instead, traveled on horseback. Remarkable means of transportation were used in 1976, when the flame was transformed to a radio signal. From Athens, this signal was transmitted bysatellitetoCanada, where it was received and used to trigger alaserbeam to re-light the flame. In 2000, the torch was carried under water by divers near theGreat Barrier Reef. Other unique means of transportation include aNative Americancanoe, acamel, andConcorde. In2004, the first global torch relay was undertaken, a journey that lasted 78 days. The Olympic flame covered a distance of more than 78,000 km in the hands of some 11,300 torchbearers, traveling to Africa and South America for the first time, visiting all previous Olympic cities and finally returning toAthensfor the2004 Summer Olympics. Another means of catching attention has been the lighting of the fire in the stadium. At the 1992 Barcelona Games,ParalympicarcherAntonio Rebolloshot a burning arrow over the cauldron from a platform at the opposite end of the stadium. Two years later, the Olympic fire was brought into the stadium ofLillehammerby aski jumper."	['By swimming.']
When was the baby deaths rate for both boys and girls equal?	"China has announced it's abolishing its one-child policy. What difference has it made, statistically speaking? 400 million births prevented The one-child policy, officially in place since 1979, has prevented 400 million births. Parents have faced fines and other punishments for having more children. The majority of the decrease in China's fertility rate happened in the 1970s. It dropped from 5.8 children per woman in 1970 to 2.7 in 1978. Despite the one-child policy the rate had only fallen to 1.7 by 2013. 21:28-baby deaths rate Since the one-child policy was introduced, baby girls have become more likely to die than boys. In the 1970s, according to the United Nations, 60 males per 1, 000 live births died under the age of one. For girls the figure was 53. In the 1980s, after the one-child policy became official, the rate for both was 36. By the 1990s, 26 males per 1,000 live births died before the age of one - and 33 girls. The 2000s saw 21 boys per 1,000 live births dying and 28 girls. 1.16 boys born for every girl Sexually selective abortions have been considered as a major cause of China's unusual imbalance. Gietel-Basten, associate professor in social policy at Oxford University, says the births of many girls are not registered if parents have broken the rule by having two children, adding officials often turn a blind eye. It's estimated there are now 33 million more men than women in China. 4: 2: 1 families With the ageing of China's population and the continuation of the one-child policy, a ""4: 2 :1"" home is the description given to households in which there are four grandparent, cared for by two working age parents, who themselves have one child. By 2050, it's predicted that a quarter of China's population will be 65 or older. The predicted decline in the number of people of working age is thought to have persuaded the government to drop the one-child policy."	['In the 1980s.']

What's the author's purpose in the passage?	"The day my fiance fell to his death, it started to snow, just like the bottom hadn't fallen out of my world when he fell off the roof. His body, when I found it, was lightly covered with snow. It snowed almost every day for the next four months, while I sat on the couch and watched it pile up. One morning, I shuffled downstairs and was surprised to see a snowplow clearing my driveway and the bent back of a woman shoveling my walk. I dropped to my knees, crawled through the living room, and back upstairs so those good Samaritans would not see me. I was _ . My first thought was, how would I ever repay them? I didn't have the strength to brush my hair, let alone shovel someone's walk. Before Jon's death, I took pride in the fact that I rarely asked for help or favors. I defined myself by my competence and independence. How could I respect myself if all I did was sit on the couch everyday and watch the snow fall? Learning how to receive the love and support that came my way wasn't easy. Friends cooked for me and I cried because I couldn't even help them set the table. ""I'm not usually this lazy,"" I swept. Finally, my friend Kathy sat down with me and said, ""Mary, cooking for you is not a burden. It makes me feel good to be able to do something for you."" Over and over, I heard similar words of comfort from the people who supported me during those dark days. One very wise man told me, ""You are not doing nothing. Being fully open to your grief may be the hardest work you will ever do."" In many ways I have changed for the better. I have been surprised to learn that there is incredible freedom that comes from facing one's worst fear and walking away whole."	['To tell us to walk out of hardest work confidently and bravely.']

Beethoven was a talented child in music. People at that time thought he was as clever as Mozart. His father wanted to make money from his talent, so he told him to practice and play all the time. If he didn't do that, his father would be angry with him and beat him. Beethoven was very short and ugly.

The recent study shows blind people are better at telling_.	"Where is that noise coming from? Not sure? Try living with your eyes closed for a few years. Blind people are better at locating sounds than people who can see, a new study says, Without the benefits of vision the ears seem to work much better. Previous studies have shown that blind people are better than others at reaching out and touching the sources of sounds that are close by. Researchers from the University of Montreal wanted to see if blind people were also better at locating sounds that are far away. Twenty-three blind people participated in the study. All had been sightless for at least 20 years. Fourteen of them had lost their vision before age 11. The rest went blind after age 16. The experiment also included 10 people who could see but were wearing blindfolds. In one task, volunteers had to pick the direction of a sound coming from about 3 meters away. When the sound was in front of them or slightly off center in front, both groups performed equally well. When sounds came from the side or the back, however, the blind group performed much better than the blindfolded group. The participants who had been blind since childhood did slightly better than those who lost their sight later. Recognizing the locations of distant sounds can be a matter of life-or-death for blind people, say the researchers. Crossing the street, for instance, is much harder when you can't see the cars coming. Still, the researchers were surprised by how well the blind participants did, especially those who went blind after age 16. In another experiment, the scientists also found that parts of the brain that normally deal with visual information became active in locating sound in the people who were blind by age 11. These brain parts didn't show sound-location activity in the other group of blind people or in the sighted people. The scientists now want to learn more about the workings of brains of ""late-onset"" blind people."	['the locations of distant sounds']
Which of the following is NOT mentioned as a way to measure the time?	"How should one invest a sum of money in these clays of inflation ?

Here I am going to offer some advice on collecting antique clocks, which I personally consider are among the most interesting of antiques. I sometimes wonder what a being from another planet might report back about our way of life. ""The planet Earth is ruled by a mysterious creature that sits or stands in a room and makes a strange ticking sound. It has a face with twelve black marks and two hands. Men can do nothing without its permission, and it fastens its young round people's wrists so that everywhere men go they are still under its control. This creature is the real master of Earth and men are its slaves ."" Whether or not we are slaves of time today depends on our culture and personality, but it is believed that many years ago kings kept special slaves to tell the time. Certain men were very clever at measuring the time of clay according to the beating of their own hearts. They were made to stand in a fixed place and every hour or so would shout tire time. So it seems that the first clocks were human beings. However, men quickly found more convenient and reliable ways of telling the time. They learned to use the shadows cast by the sun. They marked the hours on candles, used sand in hour- glasses, and invented water-clocks. Indeed, any serious student of antique should spend as much time as possible visiting palaces, stately homes and museums to see some of the finest examples of clocks from the past. Antique clocks could be very expensive, but one of the joys of collecting clocks is that it is still possible to find quite cheap ones for your own home. After all, if you are going to be ruled by time, why not invest in air antique clock and perhaps make a future profit ?"	['Keeping slaves busy day and night.']
Students in the old system may spend _ years at college to get bachelor's degrees.	"A growing number of college students are applying to take entry tests for medical and dental schools among increasing graduate unemployment in Korea. ""I've decided to apply for the test to enter a medical college to become a doctor, changing from my original plan to prepare for a lawyer qualification exam in order to get a more stable job in the future,"" said a 24-year-old college graduate, Lee, who majored in business administration during his undergraduate schooling. The new medical and dental school system is getting popularity, attracting an increasing number of students every year since its appearance in 2004, as it is open to all college graduates regardless of their previous majors. The Education Development introduced the new medical and dental education system, in which college students with bachelor's degrees are allowed to study medicine or dentistry by taking the Medical Education Test (MET) and Dental Education Test (DET). Ten medical schools and six dental colleges that have used the new system have received 4,377 applications for the entrance exams. Applicants are getting younger compared with those in their 20s representing 76.9 percent of the total. The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests. Under the existing medical and dental education system, students should take a two-year premedical course followed by a four-year medical course. Students graduating under the new medical or dental education system are given master's degrees, while those graduates who studied under the previous system have bachelor's degrees."	['six']
We know from the text that scientists at the time of the Roman Empire believed in _ .	"Renaissance is a French word. It means ""rebirth"". It's a strange name for a period of history. What was exactly "" reborn"" during the Renaissance? To answer this question, we need to look back at the time of the Roman Empire. At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison. By the time of the fourteenth century, however, some parts of the Christian Church were becoming less strict about their ideas and there was a new state of mind among artists, doctors and scientist. People wanted to find out more about the world by studying it. This attitude of investigation had been common in classical scholars, and it was 'reborn' during the Renaissance."

What does the writer ask us to do?	"Do you want to spend a holiday in space? Dennis Tito, a businessman, has become the world's first ""space tourist"". He went on a 10-day visit to the International Space Station. He paid 14 million pounds for his journey. A year later, Martin, a musician from an American band, wanted to do the same. He was only 22 years old and probably very rich too. He had to go for a lot of training to see whether he was fit enough to travel. He is still waiting for his holiday of a lifetime. Many people believe that this is only the start of something new. We made interviews among teenagers from around the world and the following is what they said about space travel. ""It's a great idea. I hope space travel will be common in about 50 years' time. I'd really love to do it and I think Mr. Tito was very lucky."" (Kate from Australia) ""I would like to see our beautiful Earth from space. There are lots of secrets to explore in space and I would go into space if I could."" (Ben from China) ""I think space travel is really bad for the environment. Maybe in the future they will make a cleaner way of travelling but until they do, I don't want to go. We should look after our own planet first.""(Richard from Canada) ""It must be very boring and dangerous to sit in that small space shuttle . I'd rather take a plane and go to another place on earth."" (Lisa from the UK) So, as you can see, many of our teenagers had different opinions. Whether you like it or not, space travel is going to become an important thing in the future. We are looking forward to hearing your opinions."	['To share our opinions about space travel.']
Which of the following sentences is NOT right?	When someone walks into a room wearing bright colours, everyone seems to take notice. Beautiful bright colours can easily draw our attention. Fresh roses can cheer us up when we're feeling blue. Dressing up in colourful clothing can bring us into a more positive mood. What shall I wear today? What colour should I choose? Dressing yourself for the day is quite important whether you know it or not. Our moods often show what our bodies end up wearing. When you look in the mirror after you dress, train yourself to notice how you feel when you see yourself. Notice your mood. If you are not feeling yourself, could the colour of what you are wearing irritate your nervous system? Did you never notice that before? We all know that dark colours can tell lies. They can make you look and feel older than you really are. That is why baby clothes never come in dark colours. To the mind, dark colours seem easier to hold power, but to the heart and feeling level, they don't help your heart to open. Bring happy colours and happiness to go hand in hand. Bright happy colours open your heart, calming your nervous system. Some advice: If you work around people who wear black, try to find a happy colour to look at to replace the picture of dark colours in your mind. At night, wear soft clothes in light colours to help your nervous system calm down and smooth it out, preparing yourself for sleep. Don't dress children in dark colours because their nervous systems are just beginning to feel.	['We should dress children in dark colours.']
The passage tells us _ .	When we meet another person for the first time, we are actually flooded with new information. Almost at once, we notice his appearance, style of dress, and manner of speech. Furthermore (besides), as we listen to what he has to say and observe the things he does, we begin to form some ideas of what kind of person he is and what he intends to do. As you know from your own experience, though, we do not only gather these separate pieces of information. Instead, we go further and combine them into a unified picture. In short, we form an overall impression of each person we meet--an impression that can be favorable (making people like) or unfavorable. But how precisely (exactly) do we perform this task? How do we combine so much different information into a clear first impression with such quick speed? A great deal of research has been performed on this question, and results point to the following answer: we perform this task through a special type of averaging . Expressed very simply, our impressions of others seem to represent a weighted average of all information that can be gathered about them. That is, they reflect a process in which all information we have about others is averaged together--but with some facts, or input receiving greater weight than others. As you can readily see, this makes good sense. For example, in forming an impression of a new boss you would probably be affected to a much greater degree by how this person gives you orders (whether respectfully or not) than by the color1 of his or her eyes. The fact that not all information about other persons affects our impressions of them to the same degree, raises an important question. Just what kinds of input receive the greatest weight? Again research provides some revealing answers.	['what kinds of input receive the greatest weight are not clear now.']
A big rock concert can make young people _	Most young people like to go to rock concerts these days. They like the loud and exciting sound of the music and they enjoy the excitement of a big concert. Rock stars usually have a different style. Their music is exciting and different, and the way they dance and dress makes them popular with young people. The words of rock songs are usually quite simple, but the music itself is complex . But some rock stars have problems after they become famous. They don't know what to do when they suddenly succeed, and often they start to drink or to take drugs . Then their health becomes bad. Some like Elvis Presley , died very young because of drugs.

What would be the best title for the passage?	""" Yeah! Auntie is here! "" screamed my husband's niece and nephew together. "" Let me get the door!"" "" No, let me !"" Each one's goal was to get there first and open the door for their Auntie, Me! I couldn't get enough of them, of their youthful love of life, and their excitement every time I visited! To be honest, it was partially because of the Surprise Travel Bag that I carried in. It was a tradition that I started when they were young. Each time I went to see them, I would take a large bag filled with toys, coloring books, candy, magic markers and ""games"". The contents were different but the rules were not. They included: one may get a turn to choose what activity we would do; another may take a turn to go first when we played a game; ..... We shared the treats after the games and cleaned up after we played . Then, sadly, they watched the Surprise Travel Bag go away with their Auntie. Now my niece and nephew have grown into young adults. They spend most of their visits listening to their iPods, messaging on their phones.... I completely forgot that I had put my two Surprise Travel Bags in the basement until my husband found them this weekend. I held the bags tightly in my arms, remembering our laughter and fun-filled get-togethers. My big decision now is to whom I will pass the Surprise Travel Bags so that the fun that the bags help to create can continue."	['The Surprise Travel Bags']
What mistake do women drivers most probably make while driving?	"High heels, coffee cups and dogs have been regarded as three of the most dangerous things to have in a car. The seemingly harmless items have been responsible for more than 13 million crashes and near misses on Britain's roads. While men were responsible for the greater number of accidents reported, women played their part by driving in high heels. Putting fashion over function meant 44 percent of female motorists had been prevented from using the pedals correctly by their high heels--with those aged 25 to 34 accounting for most of the incidents reported. Those keen for a caffeine kick while driving can also create an accident if they leave empty coffee cups lying around their vehicle. Twenty percent of those surveyed admitted they had crashed their car or had a near miss after a deserted coffee cup or empty drink bottle rolled under their brake pedal . However, it is not just wearing and eating that cause a threat from inside the car, man's best friend could also cause a catastrophe if not safely secured. One in eight motorists claimed to have had a scrape or near miss on the road due to their dog's wandering freely, climbing into the front seat or trying to escape through the windows. The accidents meant drivers took their eyes off the road for more than three seconds each time, according to the poll of 2,000 British motorists. The survey has found drivers will pick up an average bill of PS261.47 for the damage caused by every crash. Londoners were the most at risk of an accident closely followed by motorists in the West Midland and Wales. Janet Connor, a managing director, said many accidents could be avoided if people cleaned their cars regularly, as one in ten drivers involved in crashes admitted to driving inside a mountain of debris. She said, ""The possible dangers and distractions outside the car are well known but as the evidence suggests, those within the car are often forgotten."""	['They wear shoes with high heels.']
The writer learnt from Rebekah that a parent's real concern should be _ .	"I opened my new patient's chart and headed for her room. My son, Eric, had just brought home a disappointing report card, and my daughter, Shannon, and I had argued again about her getting a driver's license. For the next eight hours I wanted to throw myself into helping people who I knew had much more to worry about than I did. Rebekah, mother of three lovely little girls, was only 32, admitted for chemotherapy after breast-cancer surgery, When I gave her an injection, Rebekah shut her eyes tightly and murmured a prayer until it was over. Then she smiled and squeezed my hand. ""Before you go, could you get my Bible from the table?"" I handed her the worn book. ""Do you have a favorite Bible verse?"" she asked. ""Jesus wept. John 11: 35."" ""Such a sad one,"" she said. ""Why?""""It makes me feel closer to Jesus, knowing he also experienced human sorrow."" Rebekah nodded thoughtfully and started flipping through her Bible as I shut the door quietly behind me. During the following months, her hospital stays became frequent and she worried about her children. One day when I entered her room, I found her talking into a tape recorder. She picked up a notebook and held it out to me. ""I'm making a tape for my daughters, "" she said. I read the list on her pad: starting school, confirmation, turning 16, first date, graduation. While I worried how to help her deal with death, she was planning for her children's future. She usually waited until the early hours of the morning to record the tapes so she could be free from interruptions. She filled them with family stories and advice,trying to cram a lifetime of love into a few precious hours. Finally, every item in her notes had been checked off and she entrusted the tapes to her husband. I often wondered what I would say in her place. My kids joked that I was like an FBI agent, with my constant questions about where they'd been and who they'd been with. Where, I thought, are my words of encouragement and love? It was three o'clock one afternoon when I got an urgent call from the hospital. Rebekah wanted me to come immediately with a blank tape. She was breathing hard when I entered her room. I slipped the tape into the recorder and held the microphone to her lips. ""Ruthie, Hannah, Molly, this is the most important tape."" She held my hand and closed her eyes. ""Someday your daddy will bring home a new mommy. Please make her feel special. Show her how to take care of you. Ruthie, honey, help her get your Brownie uniform ready each Tuesday. Hannah, tell her you don't want meat sauce on your spaghetti. Molly, don't get mad if there's no apple juice. Drink something else. It's okay to be sad, sweeties. Jesus cried too. He knows about sadness and will help you to be happy again. Remember, I'll always love you. I shut off the recorder and Rebekah sighed deeply. ""Thank you, Nan, ""You'll give this one to them, won't you?"" she murmured as she slid into sleep. A time would come when the tape would be played for Rebekah's children, but right then, after I smoothed Rebekah's blanket, I got in my car and hurried home. I thought of how my Shannon also liked her sauce on the side and suddenly that quirk, which had annoyed me so many times, seemed to make her so much more precious. That night the kids didn't go out; they sat with me long after the spaghetti sauce had dried onto the dishes. And we talked, without interrogations, without complaints,late into the night."	['having encouraging and loving talks with children.']
The main idea of the passage is_.	"Men weigh up potential partners almost instantaneously based on their appearance because their ""ancient"" genetic preference for attractive mates leads them to, experts claim. According to research, a woman with an attractive face is taken by men to be fertile and able to continue the family line, appealing to the man's survival instinct. In contrast women take longer to decide their feelings for a man because they need to weigh up whether he will be a committed partner who will provide for them well - part of their survival programming. They tested men and women's preference towards looks by conducting a series of tests on 20 women and 20 men, making them perform tasks while recording their brain activity. While the subjects were doing the task they were shown a series of photographs of faces of the opposite sex, ranging from attractive to ugly. Men were easily distracted when they saw a pretty face but women stuck to the task. Prof van Vugt said: ""Men definitely have the most wandering eye but it is because they have evolved to pay attention to cues of fertility and one of those cues is facial beauty - it's not that men are shallow."" But we found they do make snap judgments about women, much earlier than was previously thought. They make that decision on whether a woman would be a good mating partner in milliseconds. This is something very ancient and a way of helping men find the best mate to produce children. Women were not distracted by attractive male faces because women need more proof of whether a man is a good mate. ""Women make that decision on behaviour, whether a man is trustworthy and committed. They make their decision much later than men."""	['that men love beauty because of gene']
From the passage we can infer that _ .	"Today in schools, it's not unusual for students to sit in the same kind of desks in the same kind of classrooms as their parents did. Schools have made progress by making use of computers and PDAs in the classroom, yet one design company believes that changes are needed, so they describe what a future classroom may look like. ""Kids are being taught to sit at these wooden desks that are basically designed for writing,"" said Mark Dziersk, the senior vice president of the design. ""They're being lectured in a structured environment."" The solution is a ""customizable education system"" called Gooru that reorganizes the classroom and replaces books, desks, pens, and so on. The three-part technology system consists of an interactive PDA called the GooBall, a backpack and a removable LCD screen for each student. Students can sit, stand or lie down when using the devices, and are not limited to desks. The idea was presented at last month's South by Southwest Interactive Conference. While some educators think the idea is interesting, they doubt whether schools will pay for the expensive and complicated system. The GooBall is an interactive communication device with six layers of learning software. The device monitors a student's heart rate and body temperature and uses GPS to track where they are. It includes instant messaging, a compass, a watch, and a topic-specific alert system that directs a student to related articles and books about whatever they are studying. Students can also choose an animal icon to show their personality. The backpack houses the main power supply for the system and holds some personal items. The pocket keeps items locked tight with a fingerprint security zipper. The portable screen functions like a laptop, providing wireless Internet access and streaming video. It also has a touch screen interface. ""I think it's an excellent idea,"" said Gary Tankard, a sixth-grader who has seen the prototype . ""I'm sure that 90 percent of kids would really like to have it."""	"[""students don't need a key to unlock the device""]"
According to the passage,we know Richard died because _ .	"A young British sailor was missing at sea yesterday in similar circumstances to the way his father died five years ago. The dinghy ,used to take Richard Smith,21,to his yacht ,was discovered empty, floating in seas off the Caribbean island.An air and sea search was carried out but he has still not been discovered . Richard's mother, Bicknell,said from her home in Hampshire,""It's so much coincidence.Richard always carried a photograph of his father attached to a poem,which included the date of his disappearance."" ""Now, it's very strange because all they have found is Richard's dinghy.We need to know this time what has happened one way or another.If you know at least you can go through the grieving process ."" In November 1996,Mr. Smith's father, Charlie,was sailing in the Tasmen sea between the Australian mainland and the island of Tasmen with his new wife.They lost radio contact with the shore and they, together with their yacht were never seen again,and their disappearance remains a mystery. Richard is described a talented and experienced sailor who has crewed for the champion ocean racer.He had sailed to the. Caribbean in November to crew ocean racing yachts for entertainment.He ended the evening drinking in the Abracbabra bar but left after local police closed it for being too noisy. About 2 am the following day Richard headed back for his dinghy.He started its outboard motor before giving all elderly woman a lift to her yacht after her dinghy had gone missing.It was the last time he was seen."

Which of the following students is most likely to be focused?	"At a primary school in a small town in the east of South Carolina, second-grade teachers Garneau and Lynne are convinced that separating elementary-age boys and girls produces immediate academic improvement in both genders . David Chadwell, South Carolina's expert of single gender education says, ""Boys and girls learn, hear and respond to their surroundings differently.We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know."" Male and female eyes are not organized in the same way, he explains.The organization of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction.""Boys understand the world as objects moving through space,"" he says. The male eye is also drawn to cooler colors like silver and black.It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy colorful family, like girls do in their class. The female eye, on the other hand, is drawn to warmer colors like red, yellow and orange.To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boy's class.Using descriptive phrases and lots of colors in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention. Boys and girls also hear differently.""When someone speaks in a loud tone, girls understand it as yelling,"" Chadwell says.""They think you're mad and can shut down."" Girls are more sensitive to sounds.He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices.Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited. A boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 69 degrees Fahrenheit.Stress in boys, he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused.Girls are more focused when seated in a warmer room around 75 degrees Fahrenheit.Girls also respond to stress differently.When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts , leaving them feeling nervous or anxious. These differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds.""Single gender programs are about making the best use of the learning."""	['A standing boy who is faced with stress']
"According to the text,the expression ""get one's act together"" _ ."	"A woman from Japan was telling a friend about her trip to the United States.The woman had visited major businesses and investment companies in New York City and Chicago. ""I studied English before I left home,""she said.""But I still was not sure that people were speaking English."" Her problem is easy to understand.Americans in business are like people who are in business anywhere.They have a language of their own.Some of the words and expressions deal with the special areas of their work.Other expressions are borrowed from different kinds of work such as the theater and movie industry. One such saying is ""get your act together"". When things go wrong in a business,an employer may get angry.He may shout,""Stop making mistakes.Get your act together."" Or,if the employer is calmer,he may say,""Let us get our act together."" Either way,the meaning is the same.Getting your act together is getting organized.In business,it usually means to develop a calm and orderly plan of action. It is difficult to tell exactly where the saying began.But,it is probable that it was in the theater or movie industry.Perhaps one of the actors was nervous and made a lot of mistakes.The director may have said,""Calm down,now.Get your act together."" Word expert James Rogers says the expression was common by the late 1970s.Mister Rogers says the Manchester Guardian newspaper used it in 1978.The newspaper said a reform policy required that the British government get its act together. Now,this expression is heard often when officials of a company meet.One company even called its yearly report,""Getting Our Act Together."" The Japanese visitor was confused by another expression used by American business people.It is cut to the chase. She heard that expression when she attended an important meeting of one company.One official was giving a very long report.It was not very interesting.In fact,some people at the meeting were falling asleep. Finally,the president of the company said,""Cut to the chase."" Cut to the chase means to stop spending so much time on details or unimportant material.Hurry and get to the good part. Naturally,this saying was started by people who make movies.Hollywood movie producers believe that most Americans want to see action movies.Many of their movies show scenes in which the actors chase each other in cars,or in airplanes or on foot. Cut is the director's word for stop.The director means to stop filming,leave out some material,and get to the chase scene now. So,if your employer tells you to cut to the chase,be sure to get to the main point of your story quickly."	['was commonly read by readers in a newspaper in 1978']
Which of the following is NOT Benjamin's invention?	"Benjamin Franklin was born on January 17,1706 in Boston,America. In his life he built a successful printing and publishing business in Philadelphia;he conducted scientific studies of electricity and made several important discoveries;he was a diplomat and statesman;he helped establish Pennsylvania's first university and America's first city hospital;he also organized the country's first subscription library . Franklin was also _ in America as an inventor until Thomas Edison. Ben had poor eyesight and needed glasses to read. He got tired of always taking them off and putting them back on,so he decided to figure out a way to make his glasses let him see both near and far. He had two pairs of glasses cut in half and put half of them together. Today,we call them bifocals .Another invention of his,an iron stove,allowed people to warm their homes. He loved to learn about new things. He also thought it was important to make life better with the things that he invented. Electricity was one of the things he experimented with when he retired from his business. Ben discovered that lightning and electricity were the same thing. The lightning rod was an important invention that we still use today to protect buildings and ships from lightning damage. Franklin preferred to have his inventions used freely for the comfort and convenience of everyone. Thomas Jefferson,the third president of America,called Benjamin Franklin ""the greatest man of the age and country in which he lived"".To Benjamin Franklin there was no greater purpose in life than to ""live usefully""."

What can not be found in Kolonaki?	With thousands of years of history and mythology in its area, prefix = st1 /Athens--named for the olive-tree-loving Athena---is more than a concrete jungle.

Why do Mother Hen and her children want to look for food?	"Mother Hen's family is very poor. They don't have lots of money to buy food. Mother Hen often takes her children out to look for food.

What can be learned from the passage?	"Have you ever had the strange feeling that you were being watched? You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you! Parapsychologists say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a ""sixth sense"" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments. In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them. For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed. Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at. If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments, said baker, ""I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves."""	['The subjects do not have a sixth sense in the experiments.']
What difference did the wallet make to Glenn?	"Two classic car collectors from the US state of Idaho found the wallet after it fell out of the back of a vintage car they were planning to restore. After an Internet search they found and contacted the owner, Glenn Goodlove. Mr. Goodlove said he probably lost the wallet in the back seat of his 1946 prefix = st1 /Hudsoncar while kissing a girl when he was home on leave from the US Navy. Jon Beck, 61, and Chuck Merrill, 72, bought the now-vintage vehicle in Idahoafter placing an ad in a local newspaper to buy a classic car in need of restoration. Driving the car home after buying it, the collectors stopped at a restaurant and saw something from below the back seat. ""Like a couple of kids, we thought we had a goldmine,"" Mr. Beck said. Instead, they found some small change -- the leather wallet held a $10 bill, Mr. Goodlove's military ID, his social security card, his driver's license and several jewellery receipts from 1952. But they were all in the name of Glenn Putnam. After searching online, Mr. Beck discovered that Mr. Putnam had since changed his name to Glenn Goodlove and moved to San Diego,California. He called Mr. Goodlove, asking to speak to a man who used to drive a '46Hudson. ""There was a silence for about 15 seconds,"" Mr. Beck told the Twin Falls Times-News. ""Then he said, 'Who is that?'"" Mr. Goodlove, now 75, says he did not even remember losing the wallet, but the find has brought memories of his youth inEverett,Washington, flooding back. ""I could see the house and the car and the town and all the good stuff from living there,"" he said. ""They've been flowing ever since he talked to me."""

The author asked her mother to write her a letter _ .	"When I learned that my 71-year-old mother was playing Scrabble--a word game--against herself, I knew I had to do something. My husband suggested we give her a computer to play against. I wasn't sure my mother was ready for it. After all, it had taken 15 years to persuade her to buy an electric cooker. Even so, we packed up our old computer and delivered it to my parents' home. And so began my mother's adventure in the world of computers. It also marked the beginning of an unusual teaching task for me. I've taught people of all ages, but I never thought I would be teaching my mother how to do anything. She has been the one teaching me all my life; to cook and sew; to enjoy the good times and put up with the bad. Now it was my turn to give something back. It wasn't easy at the beginning. There was so much to explain and to introduce. Slowly but surely, my mother caught on, making notes in a little notebook. After a few months of Scrabble and other games, I decided it was time to introduce her to word processing . This proved to be a bigger challenge to her, so I gave her some homework. I asked her to write me a letter, using different letter types, colors and spaces. ""Are you demanding this with your kindergarten pupils?"" she said. ""No, of course not,"" I said. ""They already know how to use a computer."" My mother isn't the only one experiencing a fast personal growth period. Thanks to the computer, my father has finally got over his phone allergy . For as long as I remember, and time I called, my mother would answer, Dad and I have had more phone conversations in the last two months than we've had in the past 20 years."

Why did Mike hate Christmas?	"A small, white envelope has peeked through the branches of our Christmas tree for the past 10 years. It has no name, no identification, no inscription . My husband Mike hated Christmas. He hated the overspending and the crazy running around at the last minute for the gifts given in desperation because you couldn't think of anything else. So one year I searched for something special to give Mike. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin was 12 and was on the school wrestling team. Shortly before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team of poor kids. They were dressed in ragged sneakers, and presented a sharp contrast to our boys in their golden uniforms and sparkling new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without helmets . Their team obviously could not afford them. We beat them hands down . Mike shook his head sadly. ""I wish just one of them could have won,"" he said. Mike loved kids and enjoyed coaching football and baseball. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a sports store and bought a load of wrestling headgear and shoes. I sent them anonymously to the poor team. On Christmas Eve, I placed a small, white envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me. Mike's smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year. In the years that followed, I sent a group of mentally handicapped youngsters to a hockey game, and a check to a pair of elderly brothers whose home had burned to the ground the week before Christmas. The white envelope became the highlight of Christmas. Mike died last year, but on Christmas Eve I still placed an envelope on the tree. The next morning it was joined by three more. Each of our three children had placed a white envelope on the tree for their dad. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us. By Nancy W. Gavin"	['He felt the Christmas spirit was lost in commercialized gift buying.']

""There's a certain amount of knowledge you have to have when you enter in a specific grade, and I didn't have it."" Alvarez says,""Every class I used to go in, I was like, 'Do I know this? I don't know this.'"" It was a shameful attitude, he tells his former English teacher, Antero Garcia, 29. ""You were determined to help me, but what was I willing to give? I could have actually tried."" For his part, Garcia wants to know how he could have reached out to Alvarez better, but Alvarez says Garcia had always been helpful. ""I mean, you could cheer me up, and then I see other students doing way better,"" Alvarez says,""So then, I get nervous. I get stuck, and then _ ."" He felt the situation was hopeless.

At the end of his life, what J.Paul Getty cares about most is the success in _ .	"As you probably know, J.Paul Getty was one of the richest and moat successful American industrialists in history.Quite ambitious from an early age, Getty made his first million at age 23 in 1916.He later went on to found the Getty oil company, In 1957, Fortune magazine named him the richest living American and in 1966, the Guinness Book of Records named him as the world's richest private citizen. Although he is highly regarded by vast numbers of people for his financial success, as a younger man, his drive to acquire power and money had a _ l impact on other aspects of his life, particularly in his relationships with women.He was, at one point quoted assaying ""A lasting relationship with a woman is only possible if you are a business failure."" He married five times, having children with four of these wives.He couldn't seem to keep a marriage going for very long.His obsession with having a fortune and power alienated each of his wives, eventually driving them away. His marriage with his first wife Jeanette lasted for only three years, with Allene for two years, Adolphine, four years, Ann, four years, and finally Louise, nineteen years. Perhaps as a young man, Getty was willing to pay whatever price for financial success.Yet Paul came to feel some regret in regard to his life priorities as he approached his later years when he Wrote: ""I hate and regret the failure of my marriages.I would gladly give all of my millions for just one lasting marriage success."" At the end of Getty's life, all of the wealth that he had got meant very little to him.It was only then that he became wise enough to understand what really mattered most.Despite all of his accomplishments, he died with great regret. It' s a sad story and a cautionary tale for those of us who may have chosen to make career building our highest priority , thereby ignoring our relationships.Like any other living organism, relationships require care and attention in order to grow.Even the strongest relationships will he damaged, if there is not enough care."

The writer wrote this article mainly to _ .	"They lived thousands of miles apart, and both died in 1616. This has led to a lot of studies comparing their works,which are still important to this day. To mark the 400th anniversary of Tang Xianzu and William Shakespeare's deaths, an exhibition called Dialogue Across Time and Space: Homage to Tang Xianzu and William Shakespeare is being held across 26 Chinese Cultural Centers in different countries from Sept 1 to December. Shakespeare's plays are always found in the British school curriculum, while Tang's best-known opera, The Peony Pavilion , continues to be performed worldwide. Both were ""great men in the circle of world drama', according to Aoki Masaru, who put the work of Shakespeare and Tang together in his 1943 book A History of Chinese Literary Thought. Both shared a love for a journey of self-discovery. The difference is that Shakespeare's work shows people of all backgrounds and classes, while Tang's dramas come form a more aristocratic background. Tang's lines were sung mostly in family theaters. Shakespeare, however, had to sell tickets to whoever would buy them. That probably affected their writing styles. Though few can touch Shakespeare's range and richness of work, there is one area in which Tang's work may have been better. That's in the use of dreams, not only to tell a story, but also to explore ideas. The Peony Pavilion is set in the world of the characters' dreams, especially Du Liniang, the young lady who has not seen or gotten to know Liu Mengmei when she falls in love with him. After Liu has dreamed of her, he finds her portrait three years after her death and can't stop thinking about her. But for Du, a dream is a path to the freedom that young women of ancient China normally didn't have - the freedom to love someone without their families getting in the way. Shakespeare also famously used the stage to look at Philosophy in A Midsummer Night's Dream . But in a sense, the dream was Tang's stage."

Beijing will experience sandstorms every March and April mainly because of _ .	Until late April, northern China had experienced eight severe sandstorms this year alone, worsening the air quality in half the region's cities. This year's sandstorms are considered more severe than before. Not only are they increasing in frequency and having more serious effects on air quality, but they are also occurring earlier in the season and affecting a wider area. The timing of the first sandstorm moved up by a week this year, and the sandstorm-affected area has extended beyond 3 million square kilometers. The reason for the frequent dust storms is worsening desertification in China's northern areas, caused by a combination of warm, dry weather and the rapid spread of agriculture. The dust-affected area is likely to expand to the northeast in the near future as a large area of grassland in Inner Mongolia's northern plain turns rapidly to desert. Due to its lack of rainfall and overall surface dryness in the spring, Beijing experiences sandstorms every March and April. The most recent sandstorm hit the capital on April 17 and was the worst in five years. For about 40 days every year, the pollutants cannot be diffused, as the city's location makes it a natural container for accumulating sand and dust. Rapid urban development is affecting Beijing's air quality as well. To _ the dust from hundreds of new construction sites, authorities have issued rules asking builders to cover all working areas, pack down loose dirt, and wash vehicle tires when leaving the sites.

Which of the following is right?

We know from the passage that in the 1800s _ .	Important changes took place in the lives of women in the 19th century. When men went out from their farms to cities to seek jobs in industry, peasant women had to take over the sowing, growing, and harvesting of the fields as well as caring for cattle and raising their children. When women also moved to the cities in search of work, they found that it was increasingly separated by sex and that employment opportunities for women were limited to the lower-paid jobs. Later in the century, women in industry gathered mainly in cloth-making factories, though some worked in mining or took similarly difficult and tiring jobs. In the 1800s, service work also absorbed a great number of women who arrived in the cities from the country. Young women especially took jobs as servants in middle-class and upper-class homes; and as more and more men were drawn into industry, domestic service became increasingly a female job. In the second half of the century, however, chances of other service work also opened up to women, from sales jobs in shops to teaching and nursing. These jobs came to be done mainly by women. For thousands of years, when almost all work was done on the family farm or in the family firm, home and workplace had been the same. In these cases, women could do farm work or hand work, and perform home duties such as child care and preparation of meals at the same time. Along with the development of industry, the central workplace, however, such as the factory and the department store, separated home from work. Faced with the necessity for women to choose between home and workplace, Western society began to give particular attention to the role of women as homemakers with more energy than ever before.	['more and more women began to work in domestic service']
Alfred gained confidence in learning arithmetic _ .	"Alfred Alder, a famous psychiatrist, had an interesting experience. When he was a small boy he got off to a poor start in arithmetic. His teacher got the idea that he had no ability in arithmetic, and told his parents what she thought in order that they would not expect too much of him. In this way, they too developed the idea, ""Isn't it too bad that Alfred can't do arithmetic?"" He accepted their mistaken estimate of his ability, feeling that it was useless to try, and that he was very poor at arithmetic, just as they expected. One day he became very angry at the teacher and the other students because they laughed when he said he saw how to do a problem which none of the other students had been able to solve. Adler succeeded in solving the problem. This gave him confidence. He rejected the idea that he couldn't do arithmetic and was determined to show them that he could. His anger and his new found confidence stimulated him to go at arithmetic problems with a new spirit. He now worked with interest, determination, and purpose, and he soon became extraordinarily good at arithmetic. He not only proved that he could do arithmetic, but he learned early in life from his own experience that, if a person goes at a job with determination and purpose, he may astonish himself as well as others by his ability. This experience made him realize that many people have more ability than they think they have, and that lack of success is as often the result of lack of knowledge of how to apply one's ability, lack of confidence, and lack of determination as it is the result of lack of ability."	['after he managed to find a solution to a difficult problem']
Faced with such a situation, the lady _ .	Recently we've had a popular department store open in our area. It's been the talk of the town for months. On about the third day of the grand opening, I thought I'd stop by to check it out. I noticed right away that the parking area was very busy. As I was about to exit my car, a lady was about to enter her car to leave. She was parked on the opposite side of me and there was a four way stop behind our parking areas. As the lady tried to back out to leave, some of the shoppers were extremely rude to her. They shouted and beeped their horns at the lady and she had a look of terror on her face. She looked at me and threw up both of her hands as if she didn't know what to do. I gestured for the lady to put her window down and I told her that she was doing just fine. She smiled and seemed to relax. I then became her rear view mirror as it was hard for her to see behind her while backing out of the parking space. As I watched for safety, she was able to back out enough to drive forward. At this point, she was smiling broadly!She thanked me many times. I felt that many of the other drivers weren't sympathetic enough toward. I was happy to help that lady. Besides that, who knows, we may have avoided a potential accident with this simple act of patience and kindness.	"[""seemed scared and didn't know how to deal with it.""]"
What is the best title of the passage?	"It's a Friday night. Your girl friends are out at a bar and your boyfriend is playing soccer with his mates. Two text messages later, you're eating pizza and watching action movies with three guy friends. Perfect. ""Guy friends"" have the potential to enrich your life in ways that female friends and boyfriends just can't. For starters, they provide an insider's perspective on how men think, feel and behave. When dealing with male relatives, coworkers and even boyfriends, another man's point of view can be incredibly useful. Three hours spent analyzing a situation in a cafe with your girlfriends can't compete with a quick chat to a guy friend. Many women find that time spent with male friends can be a liberating and somewhat refreshing break from spending time with the girls. Without the judgmental gaze of other females, there is less pressure to dress up and compete for attention. Traditionally, girl-guy friendships are seen as hard to maintain. Most relationships between males and females that we come across in our day-to-day lives, whether in movies or books, are romantic by nature. These cultural images make girl-guy friendships seem impossible. Yet in reality, as gender roles loosen and equality becomes a norm in the workplace, it has become much more common for platonic friendships to blossom. ""The belief that men and women can't be friends comes from another era in which women were at home and men were in the workplace, and the only way they could get together was for romance,"" explains psychologist Linda Sapadin to Psychology Today magazine. ""Now they work together and share sports interests and socialize together."" ""My boyfriend has met all of my guy friends so he's quite accepting of me hanging out with them,"" says Nellie. ""Because we've been dating so long, there's a level of trust where he knows I will make the right decision when choosing who to be friends with. ""He understands that the kind of time that I spend differs between guys and girls. When I'm out with the girls, we're gossiping or talking about clothes but when I'm spending time with the guys, it's different. I think their carefree and 'whatever goes' attitude can sometimes be exactly what I need."""	['Platonic friendship can be fun and liberating.']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Many students are under great pressure this term. There is some advice on studying and preparing for exams. Sciences Ask students what is the most difficult course, and most of them will give you the same answer: mathematics. This is also true for Dai Shuang, a 14-year-old student at No.1 Middle School. He says, ""It's so difficult that I get a headache whenever I think about the math exam."" According to Dai, studying this course is not easy. He usually studies math by himself and spends most of his free time reading math books and doing exercises. _ Qin Xia, a math teacher, offers some advice. ""Most students fear mathematics because they think the class is too difficult or boring."" he says, ""These students don't listen carefully in classes or even sleep."" In Qin's opinion, they can try to take notes. And they'd better ask teachers for help. It's difficult for students to teach themselves math, which will waste a lot of time. Besides, doing a lot of exercises is also important. Arts Zhu Tianjiao, a 13-year-old student at Megan Middle School, is very nervous because she doesn't know how to improve her English. _ Xia Bingcong, a top student at Tsinghua University shares some of her learning experiences. According to Xia, memorizing, listening and reading are important in language learning. ""Studying on a daily basis is the best choice."" Xia says."	"[""It's necessary to study English every day.""]"
What should be done to make more girls do sports according to Valerie Dunsford?	"Girls should take part in competitive sport to build confidence, the leader of a group of girls' schools will argue this week. Helen Fraser, director of the Girls Day School Trust (GDST), will tell the group that sport can help girls cope with failure. ""All girls and not just the sporty ones should take physical exercise"", Ms Fraser will say. Research that girls are far less active than boys is worrying, she argues. Ms Fraser will tell the group that she backs ""sport for all"". ""That's why I love it when our schools have A, B ,C and D teams and beyond"", she will say. The GDST draws on research from the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation which suggests only a quarter of girls in England meet basic levels ( )of activity each week. One in five girls do no activity at all, twice the proportion of boys, the research suggests. Ms Fraser says other research suggests that more than 80% of women business leaders played sports while growing up. She uses the examples of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, once a skater and tennis player, while the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, was in the French national swimming team. Ms Fraser says Olympic medallists like Jessica Ennis, Katherine Grainger and Nicola Adams are excellent role models for young women but says women's sport needs more money and more news reports.. Valerie Dunsford, head of Sheffield High School, part of GDST, said it was important to offer a large number of sports to attract different types of girls. ""Not everyone wants to be out playing the hockey "", said Ms Dunsford."	['Offering different kinds of sports to them.']
How does the writer feel about the pretty young lady?	"On Christmas morning, I went to the Cockhedge Mall. People there were all busy buying their last minute requirements. I needed to buy a birthday card for my son-in-law whose birthday is the 29th of December. Picking up a few more things as well as my cared I went to join the line for the express checkout which was for people who only had a few items in a basket and not a trolley load. This line was next to the Customer Service desk. Seemingly waiting quite a long time, I was jogged out of my thoughts by a voice behind me making comments on the things I bought. It was so funny when I realized that she was describing the contents of my basket. The owner of the voice was a very pretty young lady. I said to her that I was going to buy a box of Christmas cookies but the only ones left were not to my liking. The lady told me that just opposite Cockhedge in Superdrug they had lots of cookies. I said, ""I'm not going to bother now. I had enough of shops and I'm going home."" The assistant from the Customer Service came across at this time saying ""If there is anyone in the line with a few items in their basket, none of which needed to be weighed, I will check out their groceries at the desk."" Because I had the sprouts which needed to be weighted, the young lady accepted the offer and walked away waving goodbye. Eventually my turn came at the checkout. I was walking away when I met my new friend once again who handed me a beautiful box of Christmas cookies. With a big hug she said ""Hope you have a lovely Christmas."" She had been into Superdrug to buy me the cookies while I was still queuing in Cockhedge. What a generosity to a stranger! I was so surprised you could have knocked me down with a feather.

According to the passage, what is the problem that public schools are facing?	"As thousands of communities in the USA -- especially in the South -- became booming gateways for immigrant families from Central and South America during the 1990s and the early years of the new century, public schools struggled with the unfamiliar task of serving the large numbers of English learners arriving in their classrooms. Education programs needed _ . ""We had no teaching resources suitable for English learners here before. We had to develop them all ourselves,"" a Texas principal said. Throughout the country, districts had to train their own teachers to teach English to non-native speakers or recruit teachers from elsewhere. School staff members had to figure out how to communicate with parents who spoke no English. But even as immigration has slowed or stopped in many places, and instructional programs for English-learners have matured, serving immigrant families and their children remains a work in progress in many public schools, especially those in communities that are skeptical, or sometimes unwelcoming, to the newcomers. One of the biggest challenges educators face, is communicating effectively with parents who don't speak English -- an issue that, in part, has contributed to recent complaints of discrimination by Latino students in some cities. ""The parents' role is very important for the success of these students, but it's also one of the most difficult things we've had to tackle ,"" said Jim D. Rollins, the president of the Springdale school district, where the 19,000-student school system has gone from having no English-learners 15 years ago to more than 7,500 now. ""You have to make it a priority and work on it, work on it, and work on it."" Aside from the practical challenges, such as finding bilingual staff members, guiding districts through such dramatic changes requires school leaders to bridge difficult political and cultural divides. For school leaders in the South, especially in the last few years, this difficult job has been made harder still by the negative attitudes of some locals towards immigrants."

At first the author's attitude towards the wife of the couple was _ .	"One afternoon I toured an art museum while waiting for my husband to finish a business meeting. I was looking forward to a quiet view of the wonderful works.. A young couple viewing the paintings ahead of me chatted nonstop between themselves. I watched them a moment and decided she was doing all the talking. I admired his patience for tolerating her constant words. Disturbed by their noise, I moved on. I _ them several times as I moved through the various rooms of art. Each time I heard her constant talking, I moved away quickly. I was standing at the counter of the museum gift store doing some shopping when the couple approached the exit. Before they left, the man reached into his pocket and pulled out a white object. He turned it into a long cane and then tapped his way into the coatroom to get his wife's jacket. ""He's a brave man,"" the clerk at the counter said, ""Most of us would give up if we were blinded at such a young age. During his recovery, he made a promise his life wouldn't change. So, as before, he and his wife come in whenever there's a new art show."" ""But what does he get out of the art?"" I asked, ""He can't see."" ""Can't see! You're wrong. He sees a lot. More than you or I do,"" the clerk said, ""His wife describes each painting so he can see it in his head."" I learned something about patience, courage and love that day. I saw the patience of a young wife describing paintings to a person without sight and the courage of a husband who would not allow blindness to change his life. And I saw the love shared by two people as I watched this couple walk away arm in arm."	['bored']

The children who suffered from polio _ .	When Elizabeth Kenny was a little girl, she fell off a horse and hurt her arm. Mrs. Kenny took her to a doctor in Toowoomba, Queensland. In the doctor's, Elizabeth saw many bottles of medicine standing in a row. Since then, she wanted to be a nurse. As soon as she was old enough, Elizabeth was trained in a hospital. After working for some time, she made a surprising discovery. Among her patients were some children who had lost the use of their legs because of polio ( ) . Kenny tried putting hot cloth on their legs and washing them in a special way. The results were great. The children were able to use their legs again. Most doctors would not believe that children could get well in such a simple way. Gradually, however, she became famous. From 1993 on people from many parts of the world brought their children to Australia to receive treatment by this wonderful nurse. She was invited to America where her methods were used in many hospitals. Money was collected to build Kenny foundations which were for polio patients. Kenny died in 1952, but she will long be remembered for her fight against polio.	"[""couldn't walk""]"

What made Holiday develop a new way of controlling tempo?	Billie Holiday was an American jazz singer and songwriter. Nicknamed Lady Day by her loyal friend and musical partner, Lester Young, Holiday was a great influence on jazz and pop singing. Her voiced style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of controlling tempo . Above all, she was admired for her deeply personal and direct approach to singing. Billie Holiday was born Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her father, Clarence Halliday (Holiday), a musician, did not marry or live with her mother. Her mother had moved to Philadelphia when thirteen, after being driven away from her parents' home in Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore for becoming pregnant. With no support from her own parents, Holiday's mother arranged for the young Holiday to stay with her older married half sister, Eva Miller, who lived in Baltimore. During her final period of separation from her mother, Holiday began to perform the songs she learned while working in the brothel . By early 1929, Holiday joined her mother in Harlem. Their landlady was a sharply dressed woman named Florence Williams, who ran a brothel at 151 West 140th Street. In order to live, Holiday and her mother had to work there. Holiday had not yet turned fourteen at that time. On May 2, 1929, the house was raided , and Holiday and her mother were sent to prison. After spending some time in a workhouse, her mother was released in July, followed by Holiday in October, at the age of 14. She co-wrote a few songs, and several of them have become jazz standards, notably God Bless the Child, Don't Explain, and Lady Sings the Blues. She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by others, including Easy Living and Strange Fruit. Her early career is hard to track down exactly. But, she later gained work singing in local jazz clubs before being spotted by a talent scout , John Hammond, in 1933, aged 18. Her voice and recordings are loved for the depth of emotion and intensity she could bring to classic standards. Her range of voice was not the greatest, but, her extraordinary gravelly voice was soon to become very famous and influential. She was an important icon of the jazz era and influential in the development of jazz singing. In the late 1930s she began singing a civil rights song called Strange Fruit--a song which told the tale of a lynching of a black man in the deep south. It was very controversial for that period and it was not played on radios. It was recorded for Commodore records and she performed it many times over the next 20 years. In early 1959 she found out that she had cirrhosis of the liver. The doctor told her to stop drinking, which she did for a short time, but soon returned to heavy drinking. By May she had lost twenty pounds, friends Leonard Feather, Joe Glaser, and Allan Morrison tried to get her to check into to a hospital, she put them off. On May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to Metropolitan Hospital in New York suffering from liver and heart disease. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying, and her hospital room was raided by authorities. Police officers were stationed at the door to her room. Holiday remained under police guard at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959.Billie Holiday had difficult life experiences which influenced her attitude towards life. She experienced many violent relationships. She also became increasingly dependent on various drugs which contributed to her early death in 1959, aged just 44.	['Her voiced style.']
"The sentence ""it's out of the question"" means "" _ ""."	We're trying to decide where to go on our vacation this summer. We usually go to the Lake Arrowhead for a few weeks, but we'd like to go somewhere else this year. We're tired of doing the same thing summer after summer. Some friends of ours suggested that we go to Hawaii. That would be wonderful! I'm sure we'd enjoy a trip like that, but of course _ . In the first place, it would be rather expensive, and in the second place, there wouldn't be enough time. If we're lucky enough to save some money between now and next summer, and if I'm lucky enough to get four weeks of vacation instead of two weeks, maybe we can go to Hawaii next year. As a matter of fact, if we wanted to plan a trip like that, it might be advisable to stay home this summer and not go any place. That's one way we could begin to save some money for next year's trip. Also, if we were to stay here, I could offer to work instead of taking two weeks off; then maybe my boss would suggest that I be given four weeks' vacation next summer instead of two weeks.

Today,the British royal still represents _ of the UK.	In certain countries of the world,the king or queen is still the head country. The UK is one of these countries. So that does the British royal family represent for the British people today? Well,a large number of things. The royal family are of course a part of British history and tradition. They still have an important and meaning for many people today. It just wouldn't feel the same if there were no royal family. In addition to that,the queen has important formal duties: *as head of the state,the Queen represents the UK on visits other would leaders to visit the UK. *as head of the armed force,only the Queen can declare when the UK is at war or when the war is over. *as head of the Church of England. Not just the Queen,the royal family spend a great deal of their time traveling up and there should be royal family. Sometimes the press and media criticize the royal family as well. One criticism is that the British people should not have to pay for the royal through their taxes. Another is that the Buckingham Palace should be open to the public more often,in order to pay for the building repairs that are necessary.	['history and tradition']
What can we learn about caterpillars' warning structures from the text?	"Some caterpillars' warning signals may have evolved from walking. A team, writing in the journal Nature Communications, reported that the hair-like structures the creatures use to make sounds evolved from legs. The team studied caterpillars which use these structures to communicate their ownership of leaves. This means the caterpillars are able to ""tell"" strangers to go away without risking injury in conflicts. ""These are really interesting caterpillars,"" said Dr. Jayne Yack from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, who led the research. ""They make signals using hair-like structures which are on their back ends."" The caterpillars drag these structures across the leaf to make scraping sounds when strangers enter their ""leaf shelters"". ""When they make this signal, the strangers leave,"" explained Dr. Yack. ""It's like saying 'I'm here, get out of here --I already own this leaf'."" The scientists looked at other species within the same group of caterpillars and created a ""family tree"" of the creatures. They used chemical markers to work out the relationship between the animals, showing which in the group were the more ancient species and which species evolved more recently. ""Those more ancient species actually don't have these sound-producing structures. They have legs that they use to walk towards strangers,"" said Dr. Yack. These more ancient species, she explained, walk towards strangers and try to attack them. ""They can kill each other in the conflicts,"" Dr. Yack added. She said that the evolution of the scraping show had allowed the caterpillars to solve their conflicts without fighting. ""So our idea is that these signals actually avoid damage to both sides --they solve conflicts in a more 'friendly' way."" The study also provides a map of an evolutionary path that many other biologists are exploring."	"[""They may have evolved from caterpillars' legs.""]"
A person wearing dentures_.	Losing a baby tooth can be fun for a kid. You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning. And then you can watch your new permanent tooth grow in its place. But if a permanent tooth falls out, that's a problem. There isn't another one under the gum that can replace it. Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures. Dentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth. Dentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth. Dentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little _ if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won't have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings. People usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums. Diseased gums aren't strong and healthy, so teeth can get loose and fall out. Older people often have many cavities that have been filled over the years, and these fillings can weaken over time, leading to more tooth decay.

Which of the following is the real reason for Morri competing on the city swim team?	"Every school has an ugly girl. In my primary school, it was me. From first grade through fourth, I had to wear heavy orthopedic shoes because of my weak ankles. I sounded like overweight elephant wearing bricks whenever I took a single step. ""Hey, Bigfoot!"" ""Geez, you're going to start an earthquake!"" Then in sixth grade I had to start wear glasses. Mom asked for the least expensive ones and that made me look like a fool. ""Four eyes!"" ""Couldn't you cover up more of your faces? Why stop at the eyes?"" In Seventh, I started competing on the city swim team, thinking that if I got a killer body, nobody would notice my face. Wrong again. I loved being fast and winning ribbons now and then, but now I had red, wet eyes from the chlorine in the pool. I also did not develop a killer body. I changed my strategy at Eighth grade, the last year of middle school. I offered my help to anyone who needs. I worked for other girls, so they could hang out with their friends. My new program began to work. People who would never have acknowledged my existence before were suddenly seeking me out. I'd been feeling pretty good until one day I went to Christine's house to help her fill envelopes. Going into each envelope was invitation to Christine's birthday party; it was a big event at a fancy hotel. Complete with dinner. She asked me to help her address these envelopes. There was no envelope for me. My heart was broken. I tried to escape from all the eyes. High school had to be better, right? Yes and no. Now that I'm here, I know there are still lots of shallow people judging you on what you're wearing or how cool your hair is , but there are also kids who talk to you because they liked your answers or just as you're kind, honest, and a good friend. I still do kind things because I like the feeling I get when I am helping people. I, with my friends, went to Children's hospital, playing games and reading to the sick kids. I still had wet red and not a smart look, but you cannot tell me I am not beautiful. Every time I visit hospital, five-year-old Terry grasps my hand, ""Morri, you are so nice. I want to grow up to be just like you."""	"[""To shift others' attention from her face.""]"
It's better to buy	"Say you're in the wine store and you want to buy something new. You have nothing to go by outside of the label. Will the label tell you anything you should know? Here's some general advice: Vintage. This is the first thing we look for ourselves. You don't need to care whether 2001 or 2002 was a better year in the Sierra Foothills. The vast majority of wines at the store are meant to be drunk right away, so you make sure the wine isn't too old, particularly if you're buying it expecting lively, fresh fruitiness. We often see five-year-old Pinot Grigio and two-year-old Beaujolais Nouveau at stores, for example, so as soon as we see that kind of age on wines like those, we know we can skip them and move on(and possibly not shop there again). Alcohol content. Too many wines have too much alcohol, which leaves them unbalanced. Sure, there are some classic wines with high alcohol levels, but many of today's regular table wines--Merlot, Chardonnay--have levels at 15% or above. Some of those might be terrific, but if we had nothing else to go on, we'd look for alcohol content at about 14% and below. The more specific the better. A wine that says it's from Napa is probably a better bet than a wine that simply says it's from California. Unfortunately, this will also probably be reflected in the price, so this might not tell you much about value, If you care enough to know a few of famous vineyards for producing high-quality grapes, they might help you make an educated guess about quality. Old vines. Theoretically, older vines produce fewer, but more flavorful grapes, but the problem is that no one has defined what an ""old vine"" is, so anyone can put this on the label. Just ignore it. A phone number. You'd be surprised many small-production wines these days include a phone number on the back and an invitation to call the winerY, which is a sign of a highly personal winerY. We have called those numbers many times over the years and it's amazing how often the winemaker or winerY owner answers the phone."	['the wine from famous vineyards']
This passage is a/an _ .	"When talking about colds, maybe some people say it is very common. During the cold winter days, many people will complain the cold winter makes them catch a cold, and what they feel upset are not only the headache, cough but also the runny nose. It is so embarrassing when they forget to take a handkerchief or tissue along with them. Want to stay away from colds? Put on a happy face. Compared to unhappy people, those who are cheerful and relaxed are less likely to suffer from colds, according to a new study. It's possible that being happy helps the body fight illnesses, say the researchers from New York University. ""It seems that positive feelings may reduce the danger of illness,"" said the study's chief researcher Sheldon Cohen. In an earlier study, Cohen found that people who were cheerful and lively caught coughs and colds less often. People _ were also less likely to tell their doctors that they felt ill. In this study, Cohen has interviewed 193 adults every day for two weeks. During the interviews, the people told researchers that they were given colds by doctors and had to stay alone in a room for six days. The results showed that everyone in the study was equally likely to get ill. But for people who said they felt happy during the research period, their illness are less serious and lasted for a shorter time. Cohen believes that when people experience positive feelings, their body may produce a chemical that helps fight illness and disease. So if you are worried about your health, look on the brighter side more often."	['newspaper report']

KITCHEN 36% of people in the south-east say cleaning the cooker is their hated task. 68% of those in the north-east spend more than six hours a week cleaning their homes -- especially the kitchen -- in sharp contrast to the 49% of Welsh and West Country folk, who put their hands up to cleaning for under an hour. BEDROOM 18% believe cleaning starts here: that's the percentage of women who clean wearing their dressing gowns. 51% of women in the north-west may be staying in bed and giving their husband a cuddle --as a thank-you for helping them clean. In other places, there are far fewer helpful men. LIVING ROOM 32% of women in the north-east turn up the stereo to help make the dusting more fun. Almost six in 10 women agree, however, that cleaning is seriously energetic exercise.

It can most likely be inferred from the passage that _ .	"WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) --U.S. President Barack Obama confirmed on Saturday at the White House that China can have confidence in the American economy. ""Not just the Chinese government, but every investor can have absolute confidence in the _ of investments in the United States,"" Obama said. ""There is a reason why even in the midst of this economic downfall you have seen actual increases in investment flows here in the U. S.,""he said. Obama also noted the U. S. will push for stricter regulation of the financial industry ""front and center"" at the upcoming Group of 20Summit in London ,ending an argument between the Europe and the United States over whether more focus should be placed on financial regulatory reform. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said earlier Friady he is ""a little bit worried ""about the safety of Chineseassets in the United States ,urging the U. S. government to ensure the security of those assets. China has invested its hugeforeign exchangereserves in low-risk but low-yield assets ,such as U. S.government bonds ,to play it safe .

The best title of the passage is _ .	"Every evening, 15-year-old Rashida returns home from school, changes out of her uniform, and rushes to a neighboring farm to help her mother harvest vegetables. Her father is disabled, so the modest profit the two of them earn must cover food, clothing and other necessities for all seven children and their parents. Despite having precious little time to study, Rashida is one of the top students at her junior secondary school. But with so much responsibility on her small shoulders, she admits that it is sometimes hard for her to imagine a more promising future. Last year, Rashida was invited to join 155 other girls at Camfed Ghana's first Girls' Career Camp, a program designed to inspire girls growing up in the country's Northern Region to dream big, and to support them to pursue those dreams. ""We organized this camp because we wanted to let girls know that even if they are struggling with poverty, their lives will not be defined by limitations,"" says Dolores Dickson, Camfed Ghana's Executive Director. Over the course of five days, the camp led the junior and secondary school students through a range of experiences and career opportunities that were entirely new to them. Dr. Agnes Apusiga, a lecturer from the University of Development Studies, ran the workshop on goal-setting and career choices, describing the universities and training colleges in Ghana that could help them achieve their dreams. Participants then visited the University for Development Studies, where they toured the medical school and science labs. Another highlight was a workshop at the computer lab at Tamale Secondary School. Many of the girls had studied information technology from a book but had never before seen a computer. ""When the girls arrived at camp, they were not ambitious, because they didn't have any idea what the world held for them,"" says Eugenia Ayagiba, Project Officer with Camfed Ghana. ""Many had scarcely traveled beyond their own villages."" ""I think the most important thing that happened at the camp is that we opened a window of hope for a group of girls coming from backgrounds of poverty,"" says Eugenia. For Rashida, who has been laughed at in the past by her schoolmates because of her father's disability, the experience was important. ""She told one of the camp mentors that when she is at school, she often feels like a misfit, and she prefers to keep to herself,"" says Eugenia. ""But at the camp, it was different. She made friends with girls who have similar struggles. She took part in every single activity, every single game. On the last day, she said to her mentor, ""The camp has challenged me to study hard. Now I see that there is light at the end of the tunnel."""	"[""Girls' Career Camp""]"
Which of the following can greatly influence our success in our daily life according to the passage?	Our interpersonal skills have a great effect on success in our daily lives. This appears not only in the workplace where we can make more money or enjoy our job more, but also shows itself in marriage, raising a family and the ability to reach goals in almost every area of life. Interpersonal skills come into play when our flight is cancelled and we need to make other arrangements. _ come into play when a marriage is threatened by financial challenges or infidelity . Our communication skills even matter when we are in traffic and we need to make a decision about how to respond to other drivers. Communicating with others becomes inseparable from having a good day, or a bad day not only in how we begin communication, but in how we react to the communications of others who are having a difficult time. It can make a difference in saving a marriage or getting a divorce, celebrating a rise or getting fired, and even having your eggs cooked as the way you like at the local restaurant. Many wise men and women have stressed the importance of dealing with others in a skillful manner. Getting feedback from others can be of great value in improving our interpersonal communication skills. Often, however, others are not skilled at giving feedback. When we get negative results, they rarely include the details we need in order to improve our interpersonal skills. Since life improves so much with greater communication skills, getting feedback and an opportunity to improve would be not only life-saving for pilots, but labor-saving for the rest of us.

Why do some employers hesitate to allow remote working?	"Digital technology -- email and smart phones especially -- have vastly improved workers' ability to be productive outside of a traditional office. Even so, most white-collar work still happens in an office. One reason is that, according to findings of a new survey of office workers conducted by Wakefield Research for the IT company Citrix, most bosses are doubtful about remote working. Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it and only 35 percent say it's tolerated. Skeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while ""working"" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner. It is true, however,that working at home makes people much more efficient , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush. The fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker. More broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who have worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home. Under such circumstances, smart firms need to find ways to let their employees have enough flexibility to manage their time efficiently."	['They fear losing control of their workers.']

Why did the writer have to look for another hotel ?	"Late that afternoon I took the train back to Sydney . There I found another surprise waiting for me . My room at the hotel had been given to somebody else and they had no room for me. Harkin had known my travel plans and had planned everything . How could he have booked the room only for three days ? There was nothing to be done but to find another hotel. The waiters were happy to find me a new hotel , and when I said that I was happy to stay at the airport , thinking it might be cheaper than staying in the city , they suggested the Holiday Inn at the airport . There was one small matter : the room rate was $ 300 per night . The best hotel in Katoomba had wanted only $ 145 . I asked if there was anything cheaper they might suggest but they warned that most hotels would already be full by this time. The hotel was far from the train station , so I had to take a taxi , at $ 25 . On the way to the Holiday Inn , we passed a hotel just two blocks from the Holiday Inn that advertised a room rate of $ 104 . At the desk I asked if their room rate could go down a lot . "" No , this is a 4-star hotel,"" the waiter told me . "" In that case ,"" I replied , "" I'll just walk the two blocks to the cheap hotel."" But she warned me that they were probably full and that if I didn't take the room , it might not be available when I came back . Finally , I decided to take the room.

It can be inferred that	Because of the financial crisis in the [IS andprefix = st1 /UK, college students are beginning to struggle to find ways to pay their tuition fees and accommodations. Recently, two majorUSstudent loan lenders--Citibenk and JP Morgan Chase--announced they were leaving the student-loan industry altogether. Because banks Currently have a lack of credit , they are reluctant to offer students low-interest loans that need a several-year wait for any return of interest. In theUS, many undergraduates _ their financial needs with a private loan, although the majority can get government-funded loans. In flue 2005 -2006 academic year, $17 billion in private student leans was used to finance higher education, The short-fall in private-funding has yet to be covered and will hit many US students hard. Across the Atlantic,UKstudents have been less troubled by the crisis. Most undergraduates in the DK cover their university expenses with government-funded loans and grants . Their biggest concern is a sudden steep increase in student rent. Most young professionals now rent houses, since 80 percent of UK mortgage schemes have disappeared--a direct result of the credit crisis. This has boosted the house rent market. In large cities,UKstudents are paying almost 6.5 percent more in rent than the previous year. Figures from the DK organization Accommodation for Student show students in big cities such as London paying an average weekly rent of$ 103. Yet, despite students' suffering, the number of this year's university applications is expected to grow. During economic slumps, people regard further education as a way to survive tough job markets.

Dr.Marianm Kaufman does NOT suggest parents'encouraging their kids to _ .	"A new study of 8,000 young people in the journal ofHealthandSocialBehaviorshows that although love can make grownups live healthily and happily,it is a bad thing for young people.Puppy love may bring trouble for young people and can cause depression .The study shows that girls become more depressed than boys,and young girls are the worst of all. The possible reason for the connection between love and higher risk of depression for girls is ""loss of self"".According to the study,even though boys would say ""lose themselves in a romantic relationship"",this ""loss of self"" is much more likely to cause depression when it happens to girls.Young girls who have romantic relationships usually like hiding their feelings and opinions.They won't tell that to their parents. Dr.Marianm Kaufman,who works on young people problems,says 15% to 20% of young people will have depression during their growing.Trying romance often causes the depression.She advises kids not to jump into romance too early.During growing up,it is important for young people to build strong friendship and a strong sense of self.She also suggests the parents should encourage their kids to keep close to their friends,attend more interesting school activities and spend enough time with family. Parents should watch for their children's eating or mood changes.If they see some,they need to give help.The good news is that the connection between romance and depression seems to become weak with age.Love will always make us feel young,but only maturity gives us a chance to avoid its bad side effects."

"In the passage, the word ""COKE"" refers to _ ."	"Someone asked me, ""what do you think of youth?"" I showed him a can of COKE. See this? ""C"" means ""courage"". There's a seed in everyone's heart. As long as you really keep watering it, it will grow and harvest. Courage gives us the power to follow our dreams. Believe in yourself and be prepared for anything in the future. ""O"" stands for ""optimism"". When in trouble, some people feel disappointed but some people still keep their dreams. Be sure to choose the latter. Life is very much like a mirror. If you smile on it, it smiles back on you. If you frown, you will get a similar look in return. Throw away the sadness in your heart while filling it with brightness and hope. ""K"" can be understood as ""knowledge"". In order to keep up with the times, we should use knowledge to enrich ourselves. Knowledge is the food of thought and, as long as it is put in our brain, we will grow wiser. ""E"" is short for ""enthusiasm "". Enthusiasm is the sign of youth. We use colourful paint-brushes in our hands to create the pictures of youth on our own. Let the sky and sea know we're young. Let out our enthusiasm wherever we go. Drink a can of COKE.

What can we know about the author from the passage?	"When I was a child I never said, ""When I grow up, I want to be a CEO,"" but here I am.When I look back on my career, I realize the road to becoming a CEO isn't a straight, clearly clarified path.In fact, no two paths are the same.But whether you want to be a boss one day or not, there's a lot to learn from how leaders rise to the top of successful companies. As this series of stories shows, the paths to becoming a CEO may vary, but the people in that position share the qualities of commitment, work ethic and a strong desire for building something new.And every CEO take risks along the way--putting your life savings on the line to start a software company or leaving a big business to be one of the first employees at a startup. I grew up in Minnesota, and learned how to be an entrepreneur from my father, who has run a small business for almost 30 years.I went to Georgetown University and tried a lot of business activities in college with varying degrees of success.And I always had a dream job pattern: to walk to work, work for myself and build something for consumers. I'm only 29, so it's been a quick ride to CEO.Out of college, I worked for AOL as a product manager, then moved to Revolution Health and ran the consumer product team.In mid-2007 I left Revolution Health and started LivingSocial with several other colleagues, where I became a CEO. Career advice: Don't figure out where you want to work, or even what industry you'd like to work at.Figure out what makes you do so.What gives you a really big rush? Answer why you like things, not what you like doing...and then apply it to your work life.Also, just because you're graduating, don't stop learning.Read more books than you did in college.If you do, and they're not, you're really well-positioned to succeed in whatever you do."

What can we infer from this passage?	Most of the sandstorms that had swept China last year came from foreign land,a Chinese official in charge of desertification control said on Monday. And the invasions could partly explain the frequent sandstorms in the country in recent years despite its achievements in desertification control. Since the start of last spring,the north and northwestern Chinese regions had been hit by 17 sandstorms,of which,a dozen came from foreign land. Situated in the centralAsia sandstorm region,one of the world's four largest sandstorm sources,China also suffers from sandstorms from outside the country while being blamed as a sand source to northeast Asia. The other three major sources are in Africa,North America and Australia. The land suffering from desertification has been _ by 7,585 square kilometres annually in China,and the area of sandy land has also been falling by 1,284 square kilometres a year. The shrinkage forms a clear contrast to the fact that the land suffering from desertification and sandy feature was added by 10,400 square kilometres and 3,436 square kilometres late last century,respectively. Currently,the desertification land in China makes up 2.64 million square kilometres,accounting for 27.46 percent of the nation's land,and its sandy land totals 1.74 million square kilometres,accounting for 18.1 percent of the country's total.

What is the text mainly about?	"Australians have been warned that they face a life or death decision over their water--drink recycled sewage or die. With the drought continuing, the country is set to be forced to use purified waste water for drinking, even though there is great opposition to the measure. Queensland has become the first state to introduce the policy after a warning from its premier. ""I think in the end, because of the drought, all of Australia is going to end up drinking recycled purified water,"" said Peter Beattie. ""These are difficult decisions, but you either drink water or you die. There's no choice. It's liquid gold; it's a matter of life and death."" Beattie said Australia's second largest state would become the first to use recycled water for drinking. Water is recycled in Britain and parts of northern Europe along with the US and Israel. But Australians have never liked the idea. To try to change the way Australians think, Prime Minister John Howard and Environment Minister Malcolm Turnbull have _ Queensland's move. ""I am very strongly for recycling and Mr. Beattie is right and I agree with him completely,"" Howard said. ""Australian cities, all now facing water shortages because of the worst drought on record, must start to use recycled water."" added Turnbull, ""All of our big cities have to widen the range of water sources to include sources which are not dependent on rainfall."""

The benefits from anti aging creams are the following except that _ .	"One of today's hottest topics among women (and to an extent among men too now) is anti aging and how to reverse the signs of age.The beauty industry has responded to this by offering a wide collection of anti aging creams and other anti aging products aimed at all pocketbooks,ranging from economical to highly priced. And the question is ""do any of these often much-vaunted anti aging creams actually work?"" And if they do,how precisely do they perform their miracles? Well the appropriate response to that is that they do work - after a fashion.There certainly are anti aging creams available for a ly modest price that will reduce the appearance of wrinkles in a comparatively short period of regular application.But this really is the limit of their powers: they won't actually undo skin damage or eradicate all signs of age;they will simply modify them,some more effectively than others. The way they work is like so: they remove upper layers of dead skin cells and make deeper layers absorb water,serving to plump them up and make them look fuller and healthier.But since such anti aging creams only go skin deep,as it were,skin damage will reappear once you stop using the anti aging wrinkle cream. This means fairly heavy regular use,which might be costly depending on your choice of product.However,if you can afford it or think it's worth the cost,it won't be such an issue.After all,what woman wants to look older than her years when looking good is so tied up with many women's self-esteem and sense of identity. A compromise solution for those _ is to use the cheaper creams.In addition,it's always wise to be a little experimental to make sure you end up with the one that suits your skin best. So,to sum up: an anti wrinkle face cream will work within limits,depending on your objective."	['they make wrinkle faces rough']
The passage is mainly about _ .	"The Worldwatch Institute said in 2011 far too many people were living with less than they needed. It says, for example, nearly one billion people were hungry arid just as many were illiterate . Worldwatch Institute's Danielle Nierenberg said while a billion people went to bed hungry each night, it wasn't because of a lack of available food. ""We produce more than enough food in the world to feed not only the 7 billion people who are on earth today, but 9 to 11 billion people. By 2050, we expect the population to be about 9 and a half billion people and we now produce enough food to feed all of those people. But the question is really one of how do we get food to the people who need it the most. Poverty really delays the progress of allowing people to eat well. Not just getting enough basic crops, but being able to buy fruits and vegetables and the things that will really nourish them,"" she said. The director of the Nourishing the Planet Project said besides poverty and a lack of access to food, much food is simply lost. Worldwatch estimates 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted each year. ""20 to 50 percent of the global food harvest is wasted before it can ever reach people's stomachs. And this is really a moral problem when you consider all of the people who are hungry in the world. The good news about that 20 to 50 percent of global food waste number is that it's easy to prevent food waste.We can do it in our homes. Consumers can do a lot to prevent food waste by planning meals better, by not buying too much food. In the developing world there are storage systems that are beginning to be put in place that help farmers protect their food from crop diseases or molds ,""she said. Nierenberg said prevention measures can be put in place all along the food chain. While it may not seem obvious, the Worldwatch Institute project director said malnutrition and illiteracy are closely linked. ""When people, especially farmers, don't have the education that they need to live productive lives, they can't learn new skills. And in sub-Saharan Africa, women farmers, especially, don't have access to education. This prevents them from not only learning new cropping techniques and learning new technologies; it also prevents them from being able to get financial and banking services. They can't have bank accounts. They can't buy land. They can't buy the inputs that they need to make their crops more productive,"" she said. Nierenberg said despite the many challenges, Worldwatch is hopeful for the future. She says there are a growing number of new projects to address hunger and poverty, while at the same time protecting the environment."	['hunger and poverty']
. From the text, we can conclude that gastropubs _ .	"Whether I'm looking for a good chat with some old Mends or a quiet place to meet a colleague, the pub will be the place I always choose. I could, of course, go to a bar. But a pub, I always find, is far more comfortable and has a more relaxed atmosphere. Many people in the UK also have a favorite pub at the end of the road where they live or nearby to where they work. I can almost always guarantee that I'll bump into someone I know at my ""local"", as we British call our nearest pub. In fact, many people from the UK say that the pub is a cornerstone of British life. Coming together over a drink, usually of beer, is generally considered the best way to catch up with friends. For those who are a little reserved , as the British sometimes are, it's the best way to open up and get chatting. However, this habit is slowly changing among some British people. According to a survey completed in August by UK trade magazine The Publican, eating, rather than drinking, has become the main source of income for our 52,000 pubs. The gastropub , with its greater emphasis on food, is primarily responsible. All over the country, this more expensive type of pub has been springing up, providing a place for more formal meetings with business partners. Wine is often drunk instead of the traditional beer. But not everyone's happy. Many people hate the fact that some local pubs are closing because new gastropubs are proving more profitable. ""Beer sales are sinking and many pubs are struggling to survive,"" Rob Haward, of the British Beer and Pub Association, told UK newspaper The Daily Mail. For my part, I'm going to do all I can to keep the local British pub alive. It will be the first place I visit when I go back home."	['are somewhere between a restaurant and a bar']
If you want to be a good teacher, you should _ .	To be a good teacher, you need some of the _ of a good actor: you must be able to hold attention and interest of your students; you must be a clear speaker, with a good, strong, pleasing voice which is fully under your control; you must be able to act what you are teaching, in order to make its meaning clear. A good teacher doesn't sit still before his class; he stands all the time he is teaching; he walks about, using his arms, hands and fingers to help him in his explanations, and his face to express his feelings. Listen to him, and you will hear the loudness, the quality and musical note of his voice always changing according to what he is talking about. The fact that a good teacher has some of the gifts of a good actor doesn't mean he will indeed be able to act well on the stage, for there are very important differences between the teacher's work and the actor's. The actor has to speak words he has learnt by heart; he has to repeat exactly the same words each time he plays a certain part, even his movements and the ways in which he uses his voice are usually fixed beforehand. What he has to do is to make all these carefully learnt words seem natural on the stage. A good teacher works in quite a different way. His audience takes an active part in his play--they ask and answer questions, they obey orders, and if they don't understand something, they say so. The teacher therefore has to meet the needs of his audience. He can't learn his part by heart, because their brains couldn't keep discipline: they couldn't keep strictly to what another has written.

Where does the text probably come from?	"The oldest and most common source of renewable energy known to man, biomass is one of the most important forms energy production in the United States and elsewhere. Since such a wide variety of biomass materials is everywhere --- from trees and grasses to agricultural and city --- life wastes ---biomass promises to play a continuing role in providing power and heat for millions of people around the world. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists(UCS), biomass is a kind of renewable energy source that produces no carbon dioxide , because the energy it contains comes from the sun. When plant matter is burned, it gives off the sun's energy. In this way, biomass serves as a sort of natural battery for storing the sun's energy. As long as biomass is produced continuously ---with only as much grown as is used-- the ""battery"" lasts forever. According to the Energy Information Administration, biomass has been one of the leading renewable energy sources in the United States for several years running through 2007, making up between 0.5 and 0.9 percent of the nation's total electricity supply. In 2008---although the numbers aren't all in yet---wind power probably took over first place because of the rapid development of wind farms across the country. Producing power from biomass helps reduce some 11 million tons of carbon dioxide each year. Some homeowners also try to make their own heat by using biomass materials. Such practice may save homeowner's money, but it also produces a lot of pollution. So, the best way is to encourage power plants to use it."	['A science magazine']

How many ways of spreading the typhoid bacteria are mentioned in the text?	More than 2,400 years ago, a sickness struck Athens. The disease is said to have killed up to one third of all Athenians, including their leader Pericles. The huge loss of life helped to change the balance of power between Athens and its enemy, Sparta, in the ancient world. Historians say the sickness began in what is now Ethiopia. They say it passed through Egypt and Libya before it entered Greece. Knowledge of the disease has come mainly from the writings of the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, who survived it. So what caused the fall of Athens? Now, a study based on genetic testing says it was probably typhoid fever. Greek researchers announced the results. Journal of Infectious Diseases published the findings online last week. Researchers from the University of Athens tested human remains from an ancient burial place in the Greek capital. The researchers collected genetic material from teeth. They say tests found genetic evidence similar to that of the modern-day Salmonella . Manolis Papagrigorakis led the University of Athens team. He says the findings throw light on one of the most debated mysteries in medical history. Typhoid fever is a life-threatening disease that is common today in developing countries. Experts say there are more than 21,000,000 cases each year. Typhoid can be spread by food or drink that has been handled by a person infected with the bacteria that causes it. Bacteria in human waste can pollute water supplies. So water used for drinking or to wash food can also spread the infection. Hand washing is important to reducing the spread of typhoid. And there are vaccines that can help prevent it. Some people recover but continue to carry the bacteria. These carriers can get sick again. And they may continue to infect others. Doctors can do tests to make sure the bacteria has left the body.	['3.']

What is the Internet? The Internet is a large, world-wide collection of computer networks . A network is a small group of computers put together. The Internet is many different kinds of networks from all over the world. These networks are called the Internet. If you have learned to use the Internet, you can have a lot of interest on the World Wide Web . What is the World Wide Web? The World Wide Web has been the most popular development of the Internet. It is like a big electronic book with millions of pages. These pages are called homepages. You can find information about almost anything in the world on these pages. For example, you can use the Internet instead of a library to find information for your homework. You can also find information about your favourite sport or film star, talk to your friends or even do some shopping on the pages. Most pages have words, pictures and even sound or music. What is e-mail? Electronic mail (e-mail) is a way of sending messages to other people. It's much quicker and cheaper than sending a letter. If you want to use e-mail, you must have an e-mail address. This address must have letters and dots and an @ (means ""at""). For example: Lily @ Yahoo.com. Write a message, type a person's e-mail address, and then send the message across the Internet. People don't need to use stamps, envelopes or go to the post office because of the invention of the Internet. Quick, easy and interesting -- that's the Internet."	['lots of computer networks']
Which of the following is Not true?	The Chang'e-3, named after a Chinese goddess, is China's first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the moon. It includes a lander and a moon rover called Yutu. The Chang'e-3 spacecraft is the second phase China's lunar rogramme, which includes orbiting, landing and returning to Earth. It follows the success of the Chang'e-1 and Chang'e-2 spacecraft in 2007 and 2010. The launch of Chang'e-3 was successful. The Chang'e-3 is one of the most difficult tasks in China's space programme, the news says. The news adds that exploring the universe and seeking peaceful use of space are dreams of Chinese for thousands of years. With a lander and the moon rover Yutu, Chang'e-3 soft-landed on the moon at 9:11 p.m. Saturday. Yutu later separated from the lander and ran to the moon surface earlier Sunday. China has chosen the name Yutu for its first moon rover, after a worldwide online vote attracted people to come up with names. In Chinese folk tale, Yutu is the white pet rabbit of Chang'e, the moon goddess. Chang'e took her pet and flew towards the moon. She became a goddess and has lived there with the white animal ever since.	"[""Yutu isn't the first rover of China.""]"
From the passage we may know Richard Shelby _ tile automakers' request for federal aid?	The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months. Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon. Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago. The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid. Congressional leaders denounced them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines. G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate. Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it. Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month. Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy. But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout . A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell.	['was against']
What can we learn from the text?	"Four years ago, English soccer player Jamie Vardy was a complete unknown. At age 24, he was a part-time player for the Stockbridge Park Steels, earning only PS30 (293 yuan) a week. Fast forward to 2015, Vardy is Leicester City's star striker and only the second player in the history of the Premier League to score in eleven matches in a row. Now 28, Vardy has gone from an underdog to a superstar. Even he is surprised by his sudden rise to fame. ""I didn't expect it to happen in a million years, to be honest with you,"" he told The Telegraph. His career started with rejection. His local soccer club Sheffield Wednesday let Vardy go at age 16, believing him to be too small to play professionally. Then he found a part-time job at Stockbridge Park Steels, a soccer team in a lower league. He trained two evenings a week after working in a carbon fiber factory. Vardy lived like this until 2010. His story is an unusual one, especially because of the highly competitive nature of European soccer. It is often said that if a player can't get a professional contract by his early 20s, he will never be a star. Many of today's soccer stars were successful at a young age. Lionel Messi was named FIFA World Player of the Year at the age of 22. A 23-year-old, Neymar, is a star in the Barcelona team. But Vardy's late start didn't stop him from dreaming of greatness. ""The secret's just lots and lots of hard work and the motivation that is exactly what I want to be doing,"" Vardy told The Telegraph. ""It's putting it all into the practice on the training field."""	['Vardy has proved himself valuable at Leicester City.']

Organizers are hoping to set a Guinness World Record for the most number of shaves given in a day. Started in Australia in 2003, the craze found its way to Canadian men by 2007, and in the last couple of years, Canada has collected more, setting the pace in terms of fundraising. Money raised has traditionally gone toward prostate-cancer research, which is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men, according to Health Canada."	"[""To raise money for men's health.""]"
Which of the following statements is true?	"J.K. Rowling had reused her magic and brought Dumbledore back to life. A spokesperson for the author confirmed Rowling had sent a letter and a package to a Texas teenager who optimistically found strength in the words of a Harry Potter film after witnessing the murder of her family. Fifteen-yiear-old Cassidy Stay lost both parent s and four _ to a gunman in Texas last month. Cassidy was shot in the head and survived the gunshot wound only because she played dead. Authorities had called her survival a miracle. Cassidy had seen the unimaginable tragedy, but was still thinking about happiness. At the memorial( ) for her family, Cassidy gave a speech in front of the media saying she believed her family was ""in a much better place."" Quoting the words of Dumbledore, the wise headmaster of Hogwarts, she said, ""Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light."" The same day Cassidy gave her speech, a Facebook page called ""We want J.K. Rowling to meet Cassidy Stay"" formed and quickly draw public attention. The creator of the page claimed to know a friend of Cassidy's who ""confirmed that J.K. Rowling did write Cassidy a personal letter under the name of 'Dumbledor'. She also sent a wand, an acceptance letter to Hogwarts with a school supply list, along with the 3rdbook with Rowling's autograph."""

Why were the animals afraid of the lion? Because the lion _ .	Once there lived a lion in the big mountain.He was very big and strong.He often ate the other animals.Every day he went out to look for food.The small animals in the mountain were all afraid of him.Near the mountain there were four bulls .They are friends, and they often worked and played together.The tiger tried many times to catch them, but he could not do so.Every time he came near, the four bulls stood together to fight him.So he could do nothing to them. One day, the four bulls had a quarrel .After that each of them went his own way.When the lion saw this, he was happy.He caught one bull and ate him up .Then he caught another.One by one he caught all the four bulls and ate them up.

What is the writer's opinion about books and computers'?	Every morning my father buys a newspaper on his way to work. Every evening my mother looks through magazines at home. And every night, I look at the posters with photos of David Beckham and Yao Ming on my bedroom wall before I go to sleep. Can we imagine life without paper or print? Paper was first created about 2,000 years ago, and has been made from silk, cotton, bamboo, and, since the 19th century, from wood. People learned to write words on paper to make a book. But in those days, books could only be produced one at a time by hand. As a result, they were expensive and _ . And because there weren't many books, few people learned to read. Then printing was invented in China. When printing was developed greatly at the beginning of the 11th century, books could be produced more quickly and cheaply. As a result, more people learned to read. After that, knowledge and ideas spread quickly. Today information can be received online, downloaded from the Internet rather than found in books, and information can be kept on CD-ROMs or machines such as MP5 players. Computers are already used in classrooms, and newspapers and magazines can already be read online. So will books be replaced by computers one day? No, I don't think the Yao Ming poster on my bedroom wall will ever be replaced by a computer two meters high!	"[""Books won't be replaced by computers.""]"
To such children as described in the passage _	"""It hurts me more than you,''and ""This is for your own good.''These are the statements my mother used to make years ago when I had to learn Latin,clean my room,stay home and do homework. That was before we entered the permissive period in educafion in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school.The schools and the educators made it easy on us.They thought that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators,turned on the television,left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation. Now teachers,faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years,are realizing we've made a terrible mistake.One such teacher is Sharon Klompus who says of her students-""so passive""-and-wonders what happened.Nothing was demanded of them,she believes. Television,says Klompus,contributes to children's passivity.""We're not training kids to work any more,"" says Klompus.""we're talking about a generation of kids who've never been hurt or hungry.They have learned somebody will always do it for them. Instead of saying 'go look it up',you tell them the answer.It takes greater energy to say no to a kid."" Yes,it does.It takes energy and it takes work. It's time for parents to end their vacation and come back to work.It's time to take the car away, to turn the TV off, to tell them it hurts you more than them but it's for their own good.It's time to start telling them no again."

"Scientist started "" the laugh lab"" project _"	"Dr Wiseman started ""the laugh lab"" project in September 2001. It is the largest study of humour. Participants are invited to log on to the laugh lab website, give a few personal details, tell their favourite jokes and judge the jokes told by other people. The project will last for a year, and the organizers hope to finally discover the world's funniest joke. But there is also a serious purpose. The researches want to know what people from different nations and cultures find funny. And they want to find out the differences between the male and female sense of humour. The idea is that if we want to understand each other, we have to find out what makes us laugh. This is a subject that has long attracted psychologists and philosophers. Most of the time, people are not completely honest. We do things that society expects us to and say things that help us get what we want. But laughing cannot be controlled. When we laugh, we tell the truth about ourselves. By December 2001 over 10, 000 jokes had been submitted. This gave the scientists enough evidence to make early conclusions. It seems that men and women do have different senses of humour, for instance. ""Our findings show the major differences in the ways in which males and females use humour, "" said Dr. Wiseman. ""Males use humour to appear superior to others, while women are more skilled in languages and prefer word play. "" Researchers also found that there really is such a thing as a national sense of humour. The British enjoy what is usually called ""toilet humour"". But the French like their jokes short and sharp: ""You're a high priced lawyer. Will you answer two questions for $500?"" ""Yes. What's the second question?"" The Germans are famous for not having a sense of humour. But the survey found that German participants were more likely to find submitted jokes funny than any other nationality. Perhaps that proves the point. Is this joke funny? I don't know, but let's say yes, just to be safe. Dr Wiseman and his workmates also submitted jokes created by computer. But none of those who took part in the survey found any of them amusing. Perhaps this is relief. Computers already seem like they can do everything. At least they should leave the funny stuff to us."

Which of the following might be the proper title for the passage?	"Eye injuries from paintball games have increased among children, even as the protective equipment for the sport has improved, according to a study released yesterday in the journal pediatrics. The Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission estimated the number of emergency room visits for eye injuries caused by paintballs at 545 in 2001 and more than 1,200 in 2003. More than 40 percent of those injuries were believed to involve children, the study said. Paintballs are fired at a speed of up to 300 feet a second, the study said. Being so small, they can fit inside the bones meant to protect the eye. The study's author, Dr. David A. Listman of St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, said paintball shopping centers had generally switched to full face masks ,which have become more effective at protecting the eyes than earlier _ . But most injuries now occur in backyard play, which is more likely to involve teenagers or children.""The injuries being seen are mostly in people who did not wear the proper, or for that matter any, safety equipment,""Dr. Listman said. Those injuries can involve permanent damage to sight, he said. Dr. Listman said he believed that paintball guns should be restricted to regulated places. In the absence of such action, parents should limit children's access to the guns and insist on proper protection. Paintball guns""should be treated with the same respect as any other firearm,""he said""These are the only guns that are made to shoot at your friends."""	['Safety: When Paintball Meets Eyeball']
Which of the following is NOT true according to the letter?	"Dear Alice, You really have two different questions here, so we'll discuss them one at a time. Your problems at school may be a result of a number of things . You don't say much about how these classmates get along with each other. It's possible that all the students are feeling a little cautious in the first term. It's also possible that the others are unkind. If this is so, you have to find out why you are the class ""outsider"". In your letter you say you often offer to help others with their work. Is it possible that your classmates don't understand your offers? Could it seem that you were trying to "" buy"" friends with these offers? Is it possible that you took no notice of your classmates when you had your good friends near you ? They may have felt hurt at that time. It may take a time for them to believe in you if so. Try to ask one classmate directly what the problem is. If you hear a negative answer, at least you'll know what to do.

"By ""we were all beside ourselves writer means that they all _ ."	"It was Saturday. As always, it was a busy one, for ""Six days shall you labor and all your work"" was taken seriously back then. Outside, Father and Mr. Patrick next door were busy chopping firewood. Inside their own houses, Mother and Mrs. Patrick were engaged in spring cleaning. Somehow the boys had slipped away to the back lot with their kites. Now, even at the risk of having brother caught to beat carpets, they had sent him to the kitchen for more string . It seemed there was no limit to the heights to which kites would fly today. My mother looked at the sitting room, its furniture disordered for a thorough sweeping. Again she cast a look toward the window. ""Come on, girls! Let's take string to the boys and watch them fly the kites a minute."" On the way we met Mrs. Patric, laughing guiltily as if she were doing something wrong, together with her girls. There never was such a day for flying kites! We played all our fresh string into the boys' kites and they went up higher and higher. We could hardly distinguish the orange-colored spots of the kites. Now and then we slowly pulled one kite back, watching it dancing up and down in the wind, and finally bringing it down to earth, just for the joy of sending it up again. Even our fathers dropped their tools and joined us. Our mothers took their turn, laughing like schoolgirls. I think _ . Parents forgot their duty and their dignity; children forgot their everyday fights and little jealousies. ""Perhaps it's like this in the kingdom of heaven,"" I thought confusedly. It was growing dark before we all walked sleepily back to the housed. I suppose we had some sort of supper. I suppose there must have been surface tidying-up, for the house on Sunday looked clean and orderly enough. The strange thing was, we didn't mention that day afterward. I felt a little embarrassed. Surely none of the others had been as excited as I. I locked the memory up in that deepest part of me where we keep ""the things that cannot be and yet they are."" The years went on, then one day I was hurrying about my kitchen in a city apartment, trying to get some work out of the way while my three-year-old insistently cried her desire to ""go park, see duck."" ""I can't go!"" I said. ""I have this and this to do, and when I'm through I'll be too tired to walk that far."" My mother, who was visiting us, looked up from the peas she was shelling. ""It's a wonderful day,"" she offered, ""really warm, yet there's a fine breeze. Do you remember that day we flew kites?"" I stopped in my dash between stove and sink. The locked door flew open and with it a rush of memories. ""Come on,"" I told my little girl. ""You're right, it's too good a day to miss."" Another decade passed. We were in the aftermath of a great war. All evening we had been asking our returned soldier, the youngest Patrick Boy, about his experiences as a prisoner of war. He had talked freely, but now for a long time he had been silent. What was he thinking of --- what dark and horrible things? ""Say!"" A smile sipped out from his lips. ""Do you remember --- no, of course you wouldn't. It probably didn't make the impression on you as it did on me."" I hardly dared speak. ""Remember what?"" ""I used to think of that day a lot in POW camp , when things weren't too good. Do you remember the day we flew the kites?"""	['went wild with joy']
Donald Louria's attitude toward long living is that _ .	"Do you want to live another 100 years or more? Some experts say that scientific progress will one day help humans to last tens of years longer than what is now seen as the natural limit of the human life span . "" I think _ ,"" said Michael Zey, a Montclair State University business professor and author of two books on the future. "" I think by 2075 we will see it and that's a conservative estimate ."" At the conference in San Francisco, Donald Louria, a professor at New Jersey Medical School in Newark said progress in using genes as well as nanotechnology makes it likely that humans will live in the future beyond what has been possible in the past. "" There is a great push so that people can live from 120 to 180 years,"" he said. "" Some have suggested that there is no limit and that people could live to 200 or 300 or 500 years."" However, many scientists who research into aging are doubtful about _ and say the human body is just not designed to last about 120 years. Even with healthier lifestyles and less disease, they say failure of the brain and organs will finally lead all humans to death. Scientists also disagree on what kind of life the super aged might live. ""It remains to be seen whether you could be healthy enough to have good quality of life when you pass 120."" said Leonard Poon, director of the University of Georgia Gerontology Center. "" At present people who could get to that point are not in good health at all."""	['it is possible for humans to live longer in the future']
"The investigators believe that this is a ""professional job"" because the burglars _ ."	"Two men dressed as police officers stole about $200 million worth of art from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum early this morning. The two burglars knocked on a side door of the museum at about 1:15 am. They told the two security guards on duty that there was a disturbance in the area. The guards then made the very serious mistake of allowing the two men to go into the building. After they went in, the two burglars tied the guards up with tape. The two men stole 11 paintings and an ancient Chinese vase. The stolen works included three paintings by Rembrandt. A maintenance worker discovered the two guards at about 7 am and called police. One of the greatest losses was Rembrandt's works, ""The Storm on the Sea of Galilee."" It was a very popular attraction at the museum and was one of the most valuable works stolen. Museum officials said that the value of the stolen art is at least 200 million dollars, and may in fact be much more. The true value of the paintings is unknown, because they have not been on the market for nearly a century. This is considered to be the biggest theft ever in the United States. Officials are waiting to see whether the burglars will or try to sell them to a private collector. Museum officials and police are not sure why the burglars chose certain works and not others. There are other paintings in the museum that are even more valuable than the ones that were stolen. Special investigators are looking into the theft and the museum's security system. They believe that this is a ""professional job,"" because the people involved were well prepared and knew what they wanted."	['made careful plans about the theft']
How did the young man go down under the water?	"The motivation to succeed comes from the burning desire to achieve a purpose. Napoleon Hill wrote, ""whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve."" A young man asked Socrates the secrets to success. Socrates told the young man to meet him near the river the next morning. When they meet, Socrates asked the young man to walk with him towards the river. When the water got up to their necks, Socrates took the young man by surprise and pressed him into the water. The boy struggled to get out but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy stared turning blue. Socrates pulled his head out of the water and the first thing the young man did was to gasp and take a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, ""What did you want the most when you were there?"" the boy replied. ""Air."" Socrates said,"" That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly as you wanted the air, then you will get it. There is no other secret."" A burning desire is the starting point of all accomplishment . Just like a small fire cannot give much heat, a weak desire cannot produce great results."	['He was made and kept there by Socrates']
Some parents felt unhappy because they couldn't _ during school hours.	Mobile phone has become a problem for high schools. Some high-school students in Australia are not allowed to carry mobile phones during school hours. Mobile phone used among children has become a problem for the school. Several children have got mobile phones as Christmas presents, and more students will want them. Marry Brown, a headmaster, said that mobile phone was a distraction to students during school hours and it also gave teachers so much trouble in their classrooms. Teachers were also saying that sometimes students might use phone messages to _ during exams. She said some schools had tried to ban mobile phones. Some parents felt unhappy because they couldn't get in touch with their children. Many teachers said students should not have mobile phones at school. But there was a good reason that they could leave their phones at school offices. They also said they were easily lost and were a distraction for studies.	['get in touch with their children']
Why did Xu Lingfei take her son to visit Tu's former home?	"China's admiration of outstanding scholars has turned the well-preserved childhood home of TuYouyou,the Chinese pharmacologist who won this year's Nobel Prize in physiology or Medicine,into a popular tourist destination. Since it was announced on Monday that 84-year-old Tu had become the first Chinese citizen to win this international prize,her former home in the old town of Ningbo,Zhejiang province,has attracted visitors,especially parents and their children----even though it is not open to the public. The house,where Tu lived until she went to university in Beijing,covers an area of 2,200square meters and is priced at 150million yuan($23.6million).It is part of a complex of 37traditional buildings,including several city-and-district-level cultural relic preservation sites,that have been transformed into a high-end art,and commercial zone. ""There are continually parents taking their children,from infants in strollers to college students,to take photos in front of Tu's former home.Security guards have been ordered to go on patrol around the clock,""said Mr.Zhao,a salesperson from Ningbo Real Estate Inc Co.

Shanghai Disneyland will _ at the opening.	"DISNEY's theme park, its first on the Chinese mainland, Shanghai Disneyland, has already been completed, and will open its doors on June 16, 2016. ""Six is a lucky number to Chinese people,"" the Walt Disney Company said. Shanghai Disneyland will host an opening celebration to welcome its first guests. At the opening, it will hold more Chinese-style activities instead of Western-style ones, because the host wants to show China's local traditional culture. ""We have prepared a three-day celebration and are hiring more than 8,000 actors,"" Philippe Gas, Shanghai Disneyland's general manager, told Shanghai Television yesterday. So why has Disneyland been so popular? Well, it's described as ""the Happiest Place on Earth"" and ""a place for the young and young at heart"". Disney's storytelling in rides like roller coasters is a big reason for their parks' success. ""We tell a story in everything we do,"" Pressler said. However, Disney's parks haven't always been popular everywhere. When Disneyland Paris opened in 1992, some French people felt that American culture was invading France. But still, the park stayed open and today it is a popular place for European visitors."	['have more activities of Chinese-style']
Shawnelle mentioned her friendship with Tammy to prove _ .	"In our old neighborhood, neighbors chatted over fences. Newcomers were welcomed with chocolate and bread. It had been easy to find friends there. Our new community was different. It seemed that family roots grew deep. Deep as the Mississippi river that flowed past the tiny river town. We'd moved to decrease my husband's commute to work. Only thirty miles. After living there for six months, I was ready to move back home. I was lonely for a friend. My three boys were lonely. My husband, Lonny, fared okay, but he spent his days at work. Lonny noticed my sinking disposition. ""Shawnelle, you look unapproachable,"" he said. He and I were sitting in lawn chairs. Samuel, our three-year-old son sat in his own little chair. ""What do you mean?"" ""Body language. You placed our chairs fifteen yards away from everyone else."" ""It doesn't matter. I'm not going to have friends here. "" Just then Samuel looked up. ""Mom's right, Dad. And we just want to go home. "" That's when I knew that I needed an adjustment. I didn't want my boys to learn that the way to work through a tough time was to use a wounded and bitter attitude. Over the next few months I smiled when I didn't feel like it. We signed up for reading programs at the library and frequented parks and the bike path along the river. One afternoon Samuel and I clambered up the stairs to the library activity room. A woman who I hadn't seen before sat at an oblong table with a tiny boy. ""Hi,"" she said. ""I'm Tammy. Do you need a seat? There's one right here."" I sat down next to Tammy. Soon class was over, and I still had a lot to say. ""Why don't you come over later?"" Tammy asked. ""I live on a farm. There's plenty of room for the kids to run. "" We went. And since that day, we've been back a million times. When I look back, I'm grateful for that tough time. I learned to persevere. I'm glad I didn't give up. And as for my boys, they learned a lesson too. ""Keep moving forward,"" is what I tell them. ""Your heart will follow."""	['her family had finally fitted in the new place']
In what way is a teacher's work different from that of an actor's?	To be a good teacher, you need some of the _ of a good actor: you must be able to hold attention and interest of your students; you must be a clear speaker, with a good, strong, pleasing voice which is fully under your control; you must be able to act what you are teaching, in order to make its meaning clear. A good teacher doesn't sit still before his class; he stands all the time he is teaching; he walks about, using his arms, hands and fingers to help him in his explanations, and his face to express his feelings. Listen to him, and you will hear the loudness, the quality and musical note of his voice always changing according to what he is talking about. The fact that a good teacher has some of the gifts of a good actor doesn't mean he will indeed be able to act well on the stage, for there are very important differences between the teacher's work and the actor's. The actor has to speak words he has learnt by heart; he has to repeat exactly the same words each time he plays a certain part, even his movements and the ways in which he uses his voice are usually fixed beforehand. What he has to do is to make all these carefully learnt words seem natural on the stage. A good teacher works in quite a different way. His audience takes an active part in his play--they ask and answer questions, they obey orders, and if they don't understand something, they say so. The teacher therefore has to meet the needs of his audience. He can't learn his part by heart, because their brains couldn't keep discipline: they couldn't keep strictly to what another has written.	['He has to deal with unexpected situations.']
When the author saw the homeless man, he was _ .	"I had made up my mind a long time ago that I would not give a homeless person money, because I could never be sure what that money would be used for. Instead, I decided, I would buy them a sandwich, a cold drink on a hot day, a cup of coffee, whatever I could manage. I was out recently and saw a homeless man outside of a _ . I decided I would buy this man lunch. I bought a sandwich and soda. Just as I was leaving the store, two policemen were approaching the man. Obviously the shop owners had complained of his wandering and the police were there to draw him away from the storefronts. Just as they were about to wake him, I asked one of the officers if it was all right if I just gave the man something before he went. I was not sure why I asked the permission but the policeman said sure and I just left the bag in the man's cart, got in my car and drove off. As I was driving off I remember thinking ""I hope people saw that"". Then I had to seriously ask myself why I hoped people had seen me give the man a sandwich from Starbucks. Was it because I wanted people to think, ""She's such a nice person!""? Why did I hope others had seen me do it? I continued to wonder this all evening. The next morning, it came to me that I wanted people to have witnessed that small act of kindness not so that I would receive credit and praise but so that they might be inspired to do the same and in so doing that others still would witness their acts of kindness. Thus the whole spirit of pity and giving would be lasting."	['falling asleep']
"The expression ""get off her high horse"" is used for a girl _ ."	"In the past, many people depended on horses for transportation , farming and other kinds of work. Nowadays a lot of people still like to ride horses. So it is not surprising that many expressions about _ are still used by Americans today. Long ago, people who were rich or important rode horses that were very tall. Today, if a girl is too proud and looks down upon others, you might say she should ""get off her high horse."" Last night, I got a telephone call while I was watching my favorite television show. I decided not to answer it because ""wild horses could not drag me away"" from the television -- there was nothing that could stop me from doing what I wanted to do. Sometimes you get information ""straight from the horse's mouth."" It comes directly from the person who knows most about the subject and is the best source. Let us say your teacher tells you there is going to be a test tomorrow. You could say you got the information ""straight from the horse's mouth."" However, you would not want to call your teacher a horse! You may have heard this expression: ""You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink."" That means you can give someone advice but you cannot force him to do something he does not want to do. In politics, a ""dark-horse candidate"" is someone who is not well known to the public. Sometimes, a dark horse unexpectedly wins an election . Another piece of advice is ""do not change horses in midstream."" You would not want to get off one horse and on to another in the middle of a river. Or make major changes in an activity that has already begun."	['who thinks she is better than anyone else']
It can be concluded from the passage that_.	"Professor Smith recently persuaded 35 people, 23 of them women, to keep a diary of all their absent-minded actions for a fortnight. When he came to analyse their embarrassing lapses ( ) in a scientific report, he was surprised to find that nearly all of them fell into a few groupings, nor did the lapses appear to be entirely random . One of the women, for instance, on leaving her house for work one morning threw her dog her earrings and tried to fix a dog biscuit on her ear. ""the explanation for this is that the brain is like a computer,"" explains the professor. ""People programme themselves to do certain activities regularly. It was the woman's custom every morning to throw her dog two biscuits and then put on her earrings. But somehow the action got reversed in the programme,"" About one in twenty of the incidents the volunteers reported were these ""programme assembly failures,"" Altogether the volunteers logged 433 unintentional actions that they found themselves doing -- an average of twelve each, There appear to be peak periods in the day when we are at our zaniest . These are two hours some time between eight a.m. and noon, between four and six p.m. with a smaller peak between eight and ten p.m. ""Among men the peak seems to be when a changeover in brain 'programmes' occurs, for instance between going to and from work."" Women on average reported slightly more lapses- 12.5 compared with 10.9 for men probably because they were more reliable reporters. A startling finding of the research is that the absent-minded activity is a hazar of doing things in which we are skilled. Normally, you would expect that skill reduces the number of errors we make. But trying to avoid silly lapses by concentrating more could make things a lot worse or even dangerous."	['lapses cannot always be due to lack of concentration']

From the story, we know_.	"Dad came in the midnight. We heard every sound, but we pretended to be asleep. Next morning he looked weak and thin, sitting in a chair by the kitchen fire. The light of the fire shone through his long empty sleeve. Everything went as usual. Grandma found something to do in the bedroom. Grandpa went out for some water. Mother, with her back to us, was getting the cakes ready for breakfast. But nothing was right. When grandma came out of the bedroom, she walked on tiptoe. When grandpa came back, he said nothing about the weather. At breakfast Mother passed us the fruit and said something, but her voice was too high. At last my sister, Lou, pushed back her chair. ""It's your turn to wash the dishes."" But I had washed the dishes the night before. I said nothing because it was not right to quarrel in front of Dad just home with the empty sleeve. ""It is your turn,"" Lou said again. I looked at her in surprise. ""It is not,"" I said because I suddenly remembered Mother had told us to go on as usual. ""Children, children,"" Mother said in a quiet, glad kind of voice. And Dad was smiling because he felt at home at last."	['the two sisters often quarreled about who should wash the dishes']

The passage is mainly written for _ .	Finding summer jobs for teenagers has not always been easy, but now you no longer have to worry about what your kid can do to earn their own money.Recently I found some different sites online that offer information about what kids can do.Below is some of that information, along with questions to think about to help you come up with your own ideas. Ideas for summer work *Parks and Recreation Programs. *Babysitting during the day of school. *Working part-time at a day care for the summer. *Car washing. *Working at local vegetable stands. The easiest way for you to find ways for your child to make money is to think about others' inconveniences .Think of things you need done, or would like to have done, and what you would consider paying for these things to get done.Once you have some ideas, you can sit down with your child and talk to them about what they would be interested in doing.Then once you have an idea of what they want to do you can help them come up with fair prices. Preferably you would want to only have your child working with people you know and trust, or in the least bit you could have your child pick a partner.That way with each of them carrying cell phones, even those without service can call 911, they will be much safer.

According to the writer, things used to be _ .	Before the grass has thickened on the roadside and leaves have started growing on the trees is a perfect time to look around and see just how dirty Britain has become. The pavements are stained with chewing gum that has been spat out. Years ago I remember travelling abroad and being saddened by the plastic bags and discarded bottles on every road. Nowadays, Britain seems to look at least as bad. What has gone wrong? The problem is that the rubbish created by our increasingly mobile lives lasts a lot longer than before. If it is not cleared up and properly thrown away, it stays in the undergrowth for years; a semi-permanent reminder of what a _ little country we have now. Firstly, it is estimated that 10 billion plastic bags have been given to shoppers. These will take anything from 100 to 1,000 years to rot. However, it is not as if there is no solution to this. A few years ago, the Irish government introduced a tax on non-recyclable carrier bags and in three months reduced their use by 90%. When he was a minister, Michael Meacher attempted to introduce a similar arrangement in Britain. The plastics industry protested, of course. However, they need not have bothered; the idea was killed before it could draw breath, leaving supermarkets free to give away plastic bags. What is clearly necessary right now is some sort of combined initiative before it is too late. The alternative is to continue sliding downhill until we have a country that looks like a vast rubbish tip. We may well be at the tipping point. Yet we know that people respond to their environment. If things around them are clean and tidy, people behave cleanly and tidily. If they are surrounded by squalor , they behave squalidly. Now, much of Britain looks pretty squalid. What will it look like in five years?	['worse abroad']
When offered help, the author at first felt _ .	"Moving can bring out the best and the worst in people, I'm finding. And I've discovered where a very generous spirit lives: Defiance, Ohio. After suffering through many months of unemployment, my wife and I had to move this week from Colorado to Ohio, where she would work as a sales assistant. Not knowing a person there, we were pretty concerned about all the work, including how we'd get all the things unloaded without killing ourselves. We decided to pay a couple of college students to help with all the heavy lifting once we got there. But one neighbor after another stopped by and joined in. ""What? Have we moved to some other country? Maybe we've died and gone to heaven!"" I thought. Unloading actually became fun as we connected with so many wonderful new friends as we worked. The more people that helped, the easier the work became. A job we were afraid might take days for the two of us alone was done in just a few hours. Many total strangers would either walk by or drive by to ask us if we were moving in. Many were delighted that this fine old house that had sat empty for so long was coming to life again. We were invited to an outdoor meal yesterday by neighbors on the same street. All the while, my brain was on this new sense of hope that people could be outgoing and kind to strangers. Among all the conversations were lots of offers to be of help to one another in a variety of ways. It's wonderful to live in such a kind little town. I feel so grateful to be here, and wish the rest of the world could see how an entire society can be a model for what it's like to look out for one another. I used to stay away from friendships with strangers, but now I live in Defiance!"	['surprised']
What can be a suitable title for the text?	"When young people begin to live independently, home-hunting can bring some stress. But they would do well to remember that a new alternative is available--micro-home. Called ""tiny houses"", these houses have all living necessities in a small package, including kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. Generally under 50 square meters, most tiny houses accommodate just one or two people though some claim the space for more. What's lost in size is not lost in design as these homes are often quite unique and modern in design. Besides an attractive appearance, tiny houses can also have unique practical features. Making the best of urban space, the 72- to122-centimeter-wide Keret House in Warsaw, the world's narrowest home, fills in an alley. The Ecocapsule home uses solar power, wind power and rainwater collection to enable its owner to live practically anywhere. A system of rails allows the DALE micro-home to adjust room size and number as well as adding the option of an open or enclosed courtyard. Visually appealing as micro-homes are, there are a few drawbacks to consider before getting cozy on a mini-couch. Moving into a tiny house requires the removing of most non-essentials, regardless of the emotional connection to them. Guests will also mostly be out of the question as the limited space may even cause a solitary individual to experience some cabin fever . And finally, a micro-home is likely a temporary living option for most people since they will probably start families and acquiremore possessions. Though the limitations will scare some, there is usually a benefit. A small size results in a small price tag and small bills, making tiny houses easier to save up for and budget. And though you won't have much stuff around the house, this can provide the comfort of simple living and repairs. Micro-homes are also practically mobile and have eco-friendliness that can't be matched by other homes. They probably aren't for everyone or forever, but when it comes to your next (or first) home, they could be just what you need."	['Micro-homes--More Than Tiny!']
How much will you pay if you want to rent a new apartment?	The companies below offer student accommodation all around London, no matter what university you are attending. And they limit the complications that other rental companies can have (such as paying for heat and hot water, paying your rent yearly and so on). CRM Students has 12 different properties to choose from in London with various size choices depending on your budget and requirements. Prices start from PS 140 per week. International Students House is unique because they offer twin, triple and quad rooms, which means they are cheaper per week than others. Of course, you will be sharing your bedroom with up to three other people. Prices start from PS 78.4 per week. Prodigy Living has several properties in London (most of which have just been decorated) and offers en-suite rooms in flats and one-bedroom flats. Prices start from PS 209 per week. Scape Living has properties in Greenwich, Surrey and Shoreditch, with the latter two being new apartments as of 2015, which means they will be in pretty good condition. Prices start from PS 185 per week. Unite Students offers student accommodation in various areas of London, from en-suite rooms to two-bedroom flats, with lots of sharing choices available. Prices start from PS169 per week. These student housing associations are the best I found on the Internet for cheap student accommodation in London; however, I am aware that new ones are appearing every day. For a full list of associations like these (but most are more expensive than those listed above), I recommend checking out UCL's alternative accommodation page. Note: Most rooms require a small deposit , which is typically the same value as your weekly rental price ( for example, PS 200 per week =PS 200 deposit before you move in).

What is the reason for the speculation according to the head of the U.N. Environment Program?	"Poor families in some countries spend as much as eighty percent of their money on food. Rising prices in recent months have created the worst food crisis in more than thirty years. The United Nations World Food Program says high food prices could push one hundred million people into hunger. Nathan Childs is an expert on rice markets. He notes that the harvest for the latest growing season was the largest on record. But India, Vietnam and others have restricted exports to keep prices down at home and protect supplies. Thailand's agriculture minister says his country will never restrict rice exports. He told the Reuters news agency Thursday that Thailand has enough supplies to meet demand at home and for export. Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter. Recent signs of an increase in supplies have helped ease record prices for Thai rice. Prices rose last week above one thousand dollars a ton. Vietnam, the second biggest exporter, has banned exports until June. And Vietnamese officials have now warned that non-food traders who buy rice for speculation will be severely punished. Some experts say speculation is a necessary part of market activity. But the head of the U.N. Environment Program blames it for the high food prices. ""We have enough food on this planet today to feed everyone."" Achim Steiner told the Associated Press. Earlier, a member of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission didn't accept the idea that speculators are the main cause. Bart Chilton blamed reduced harvests and grain supplies and the falling value of the dollar. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called heads of major international agencies to a meeting this week in the Swiss capital, Bern. He says high food prices could harm world trade, economic growth, social progress and political security."	['High food prices.']

The farmer got up behind his son because _ .	"Once there was an old farmer. He had a horse and the horse was almost as old as himself. One morning he set out with his young son to sell the horse before it died. The father and the son walked because the farmer did not want the horse to be too tired . They met two men on the road. They said, ""Why are you walking, farmer? You have a horse. It's a long way to get to the market. ""The farmer knew that this was true, so he rode on the horse while his son walked.

What is true of little Aidan Sullivan?	"A heartless thief is believed to have crashed a fund-raiser and made off with a bag of cash meant to help a New York City firefighter pay for life-changing surgery for his 9-year-old son. But little Aidan Sullivan -- who was born with a facial defect and no right ear -- yesterday put up a brave front, with a message for the crook(thief): ""I'm going to kick your butt!"" ""I want to look normal,"" said Aidan, whose father, Tim, is a firefighter in the Bronx. The third-grader has hemi facial micro soma, in which one half of the face doesn't develop correctly. Last weekend, family friend Peter Drake, a Ridgefield, Conn., firefighter, hosted a fund-raiser, collecting between $8,000 and $9,000. But when the party at a Danbury, Conn., Irish cultural center was over, the money had disappeared. ""At the end of the night, all the money that was donated was put in a zippered bag,"" said Tim Sullivan. ""A bartender gave the bag to Pete... He had it in his hands. He put it down to go do something, and when he came back, he saw that it was missing."" Sullivan said his longtime friend -- who has had fund-raisers to pay for Aidan's 10 previous surgeries -- is ""devastated."" ""Pete was so upset. He kept saying, 'I let Aidan down, I let Aidan down,"" Colleen Sullivan, 40, recalled. ""We even went Dumpster diving, in case it was thrown out."" The Sullivans plan to go ahead with the March 1 surgery led by specialists at NYU's Langone Medical Center in Manhattan. The money would have offset the $10,000 to $15,000 that insurance doesn't cover. Yesterday, Aidan said he's not a fan of hospitals and doesn't like to be away from his sister, Kaylee, 4. But he's willing to do it. ""I'm excited,"" he said. ""Finally, an ear."""	['He has received 10 surgeries before.']
From the passage we can infer that the Memorial Day refers to	"When the Japanese attacked America's ships at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, they did it secretly. The makers of the movie Pearl Harbor have behaved differently. The noise about Pearl Harbor, made by Disney,has reached its highest point with its premiere before the movie opens in cinemas across the US at the start of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, a time to recall national heroes who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield. As Ben Affleck is the main star, the movie seems sure to become a success in the United States at least. At almost three hours in length, it promises to be a good old Hollywood movie. There is a love story. Affleck and his co-star, Josh Hartnett, both fall in love with the navy nurse, Kate Beckinsale and, of course, there is much human courage and love of country. It's certain that Disney will be accused of ""changing"" history. The showing of actual events in a movie always causes arguments. Bits of the story are deliberately not mentioned in the movie. It does not address the theory held by some historians that President Franklin Roosevelt knew about Japan's intention to attack the ships in Pearl Harbor.It is said he did nothing, as he was aware that such a blow would allow him to take America into the Second World War. Japan remains sensitive about being accused of wartime atrocities . And Disney is sensitive about its business in Japan, where it has a theme park. Not all the reviews of the movie have been full of praise. A reviewer for Newsweek, who was given an early preview, acknowledged that the 40-minute sequence showing the attack itself was powerful. The attack comes quite late in the movie, however, and the reviewer was less impressed with the characters and the love story. ""Almost every line of the dialogue sounds like it comes from an old movie, "" the reviewer wrote."	['a day people remember those who died in wars']
The most important room to leave a light burning in is the _ .	What are some of the steps a person can take to prevent his house from being broken in while he or she is away? One step is to make sure that the house has a _ look. Living room shades could be pulled down only half-away. Bedrooms that usually have the shades pulled down at night should be left down. Another is to make sure that all outside looks are the dead-belt type. Still another is to leave several low-watt lights burning and make sure that one is in the kitchen. Lights that turn on and off automatically are the best. Then, too, it is a good idea to leave a radio turned into a talking station. Any type of conversation makes a burglar think twice before trying to enter. Finally, while away on vacation, make sure that nothing collected in the front or back of the house. Make certain that the newspaper is stopped and that a trusted neighbor has been asked to pick up the posts.	['kitchen']

Which of the following can serve as the best title for the passage?	"Get a reward for every bug you bring to live in new science museum exhibit. In a city with trillions of American cockroaches , the Houston Museum of Natural Science has agreed to pay a quarter per bug-up to 1,000-as it seeks to populate a new insect exhibit alongside its Cockrell Butterfly Center. Nancy Greig, the museum's director insists the public payday for roaches isn't just a marketing ploy . ""Absolutely, this wasn't devised as a joke,"" Greig said. ""We needed more roaches for the exhibit, so I sent this message out to everyone in the museum asking people to bring them in. Well, someone decided to tell the press, and all hell has broken loose."" ""But we really do need cockroaches."" ""One might be forgiven for never considering how to catch a live cockroach. But it's simple enough to fool them,"" Greig said, ""and even easier to catch them."" American cockroaches are the most common kind in Texas, measuring up to 2 inches long and invading homes. Despite their less-than-attractive reputation, cockroaches actually aren't that dirty. Greig even went so far as to call them ""fastidious"" saying they don't enjoy rooting in waste. They're only dirty if, say, they used a sewer line to gain access into a home. The roaches collected by the museum will become part of a display in a new exhibit that showcases insects such as cockroaches, dung beetles and termites. There's more to like about roaches, too. They don't bite, and they don't carry diseases like a mosquito, so they're generally safe to handle."	['Quarters for cockroaches']

What is the best title of the passage?	"It never occurred to Sun Yukun that the decision he made four years ago would have an impact on his career. When the 22-year-old entered college in 2009, he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one. But when he finished college and was offered a job with a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, Sun was told that he couldn't accept the offer unless he had an urban hukou (household registration record). This time, he had no choice but to change his residence status. Transferring hukou to a university became optional in 2003, and many students are confronted with the dilemma of whether to do so or not. Professionals suggest they make the decision based on their current situation and future plans. 'I regret transferring my hukou' Wang Jinbi, 20, is an accounting major at Beijing Union University. Coming from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, she transferred her hukou when she enrolled at university. ""I didn't think it was a big deal,"" Wang says. ""Since I'm registering under an urban hukou, it doesn't matter whether it's in Beijing or Inner Mongolia, I thought."" What Wang didn't expect, however, is that she would regret her decision later. ""After two years of study, I've figured out my future plans. I want to return to my hometown and make a living there,"" she says. That means Wang needs to transfer her hukou back again, which she worries will be a troublesome procedure. ""I have a friend who graduated last year. She spent a lot of time and energy transferring her hukou back to her hometown again due to complicated paperworks,"" says Wang. Guidelines for transferring hukou Wang's experience is not uncommon. Many students don't know what their decision means for their future. In order to help these students, Xie Yongqiang, from the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Justice, posted a guideline for transferring hukou on a micro blog. According to Xie, students should firstly think about where they're going to stay. ""If you like the city where you're studying and are considering staying there after graduation, then you should transfer your hukou,"" he wrote. Students should also transfer their hukou if they intend to participate in an exchange program. According to Ju Haojie, deputy director of the household registration department at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, when applying for exchange programs, it saves a lot of trouble if students have a collective hukou registered under the university. But Xie also made suggestions for students with a rural registration. ""If your family has land and a house, it's possible that you'll get a share of compensation in the event of a forced relocation. For those students, I would recommend them not to transfer their hukou,"" he wrote. This doesn't affect students in terms of receiving medical insurance and other benefits at university. 'I want to stay in Beijing' Sometimes, students abandon their rural hukou for the prospect of a better future. Tang Yanwei is one of them. The 23-year-old from Yantai, Shandong province, had a rural hukou but transferred it after enrolling at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. Although there are a lot of preferential policies for rural residents, for Tang, an urban hukou in Beijing is attractive. ""I want to stay in Beijing, so a students' collective Beijing urban hukou is a promising start,"" he says. ""I'll do anything that could help me stay here. After all, there's no turning back for me now."""	['Hukou Brings Tricky Choice']

Alarm clocks can help people _ .	People began making clocks over 500 years ago. The first clocks had only one hand---the hour hand. At a later time the clocks had the minute hand. The first clocks were big and heavy. Some rich people had servants to carry the clocks when they were out. Time passed and clocks became smaller. Bells became a part of some large clocks in cities and towns. They were for people unable to see the clock. Some clocks were in large towers . Some of them are 400 or 500 years old now. Big Ben in London is a very famous tower clock. Now many people have alarm clocks to wake them up to go to work or go to school. So clocks are the very important part of people's life.	['wake up']

It's easy to find the one-eared person!"" Her answer also made the policeman angry. Turning to the third lady, he asked, ""This is your suspect, and how would you recognize him?"" He added quickly, ""Think hard before giving a stupid answer."" The third blonde looked at the picture carefully for a moment and said, ""HMMMM ... the suspect is wearing contact lenses ."" The policeman was surprised and speechless, because he really didn't know himself if the suspect wore contacts or not. ""Well, that is a good answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file."" He left the room and went to his office, checked the suspect's file in his computer and returned with a beaming smile. ""Wow! I can't believe it ... it's TRUE! The suspect does in fact wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such a wise observation?""

""Thank you"" is used not only between friends, but also between parents and children, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives. ""Excuse me"" is another short sentence they use. When you hear someone say ""Excuse me"" behind you, you know that somebody wants to walk past you without touching you. It's not polite to interrupt others while they are talking. If you want to speak to one of them, say ""Excuse me"" first, and then begin talking. You should also do so when you want to cough or make any unpleasant noise before others. Let's all learn to say ""Thank you"" and ""Excuse me""."	['widely used']
The author makes a contrast between a prisoner's and an office worker's lives in order to show that _ .	In prison you spend the majority of your time in an 8*10 cell. At work you spend most of your time in a 6*8 cubicle . In prison you get three meals a day. At work you only get a break for one meal and you have to pay for it. In prison you get time off for good behavior. At work you get rewarded for good behavior with more work. In prison a guard locks and unlocks all the doors for you. At work you carry around a security card and unlock and open all doors yourself. In prison you can watch TV and play games. At work you get fired for watching TV and playing games (or being on the Internet). In prison you get your own toilet. At work you have to share. In prison they allow your family and friends to visit. At work you cannot even speak to your family and friends. In prison all expenses are paid by taxpayers with no work required. At work you get to pay all the expenses to go to work and then they deduct taxes from your salary to pay for prisoners. In prison you spend most of your life looking through bars , waiting to get out. At work you spend most of your time waiting to get out and inside bars. In prison there are wardens who are often sadistic . At work they are called managers.	['working in an office can be more restricting than being in prison']
What is the passage mainly about?	"I work as a volunteer for a group that helps the poor in Haiti. I decided to take my son Brain there for a week, hoping to educate him. Before getting out, I told Brain this trip would be tiring and hard. For the first two days, he said almost nothing. Then on the third day, when we were climbing over high rocky mountains , he turned to me and smiled, ""Really hard."" After that, a five-year-old girl, wearing a too large dress and broken shoes, followed Brain around. Later he said, ""I wish I could speak French."" I was surprised that this was from a boy who always hated French classes. However, the moment that really reached my heart _ in a village in the mountains. I was interviewing a woman villager for an article. By working hard, she learned to read and write and became one of the leaders of the village. Learning her story, Brain was greatly touched. His eyes were wet and there was love and respect on his face. He finally understood the importance of my work. When leaving for home, Brain even offered to stay in as a volunteer. This trip was very meaningful."	['A story of a volunteering trip.']

The young man said, ""No, thank you."" ""You may pay me only a pound, sir,"" said the boy. But the young man refused again. Then the boy told him that he would clean his shoes for nothing. The young man agreed to this, and soon one of his shoes was shining brightly. The man put the other shoe on the boy, but the boy refused to clean it unless he was paid two pounds for his work. The young man refused to pay anything and went away. But the dirty one looked so bad that he couldn't walk away. He had to turn back and gave the boy two pounds. In a very short time his shoes shone brightly."	['nothing']
In the late 1940s, if you _ , that meant you were healthy.	The concept of health holds different meanings for different people and groups. These meanings have also changed over time. This change is no more evident than in Western society today, when notions of health and health promotion are being challenged and expanded in new ways. For much of recent Western history, health has been viewed in the physical sense only. That is, good health has been connected to the smooth mechanical operation of the body, while ill health has been attributed to a breakdown in this machine. Health in this sense has been defined as the absence of disease or illness and is seen in medical terms. In the late 1940s the World Health Organization challenged this physically and medically oriented view of health. They stated that health is a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being and is not merely the absence of disease (WHO, 1946). Health and the person were seen more holistically (mind / body / spirit) and not just in physical terms. The 1970s was a time of focusing on the prevention of disease and illness by emphasizing the importance of the lifestyle and behaviour of the individual. Specific behaviours which were seen to increase risk of disease, such as smoking, lack of fitness and unhealthy eating habits, were targeted. Creating health meant providing not only medical health care, but also health promotion programs and policies which would help people maintain healthy behaviours and lifestyles. While this individualistic healthy lifestyle approach to health worked for some (the wealthy members of society), it was of little benefit to people experiencing poverty, unemployment, underemployment or who had little control over the conditions of their daily life. During the 1980s and 1990s there has been a growing swing away from seeing lifestyle risks as the root cause of poor health. While lifestyle factors still remain important, health is being viewed also in terms of the social, economic and environmental contexts in which people live. This broad approach to health is called the socio-ecological view of health. At the Ottawa Conference in 1986, a charter was developed which outlined new directions for health promotion based on the socio-ecological view of health. This charter, known as the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, remains as the backbone of health action today. In exploring the scope of health promotion it states that: Good health is a major resource for social, economic and personal development and an important dimension of the quality of life. Political, economic, social, cultural, environmental, behavioural and biological factors can all favour health or be harmful to it. (WHO, 1986)	['were strong, optimistic and happy']
To avoid bullies, you are advised to _ .	What do Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson and Phil Collins all have in common? They were all bullied at school. If you're being bullied, it doesn't mean there is something wrong with you. You have a right to feel safe. If you are being bullied at school, it is the school's responsibility to stop it. If you are being attacked outside of school, the police have the responsibility to help you. The bully is the one with the problem. A lot of bullies are already being bullied themselves. They feel powerless and so they look for ways to feel tough at school or in the street. Often, the bully is envious of other kids, so he picks on those who are cleverer, or those kids who have cool dress or more money. Usually bullies don't like themselves, so they take out their frustrations on someone else, e.g. you. What can you do? * Look calm and confident even when you are not! You can practice this in the bathroom mirror. * If possible, ignore the bully. Bullies want a reaction --if you don't seem upset, or angry, they'll often leave you alone. * Walk away. Just because a bully starts an argument doesn't mean you have to hang around and finish it. * Avoid being alone. Bullies are cowards who only pick a fight when they know they can win. If you are with friends, they are more likely to leave you alone. Get help! Tell an adult you can trust. This doesn't mean you are weak. In life you often need to get help from other people. When you have a broken leg, you get help from a doctor--it doesn't mean you are weak. If you are being bullied you also get help. Bullies want you to keep quiet. When you speak up, you refuse to play the bully's game. Telling others about the problem is a brave move.	"[""react bravely and you're your confidence""]"
In Jing's opinion, what should be done to reduce the suicide?	"Ever since Canadian psychiatrist Michael R. Phillips, who works in China, released his report saying China's suicide rate from 1995 to 1999 reached 0.023 percent, the country has been ranked among those with the highest suicide rates in the world. But Jing Jun, a professor of sociology in Tsinghua University, challenges that view and presents the true picture through his nationwide research. Jing and his students took one year to set up the first national database on suicide rate to grasp the overall trend of suicides in China. They collected data from the Health Statistics Annuals of the World Health Organization (sample size 10 million), and the country's Health Statistics Annuals (which cover 100 million people). The database covers 23 years, from 1987 to 2009. Jing calculates the suicide rate in China based on these data. Though the suicide rate was comparatively high in the early years, his study shows it has dropped in recent years, as opposed to the ascending trend in the rest of the world. According to Jing's calculation, China's suicide rate had dropped to about 0.01 percent in 2004. In 2009, the figure dropped further to 0.007 percent, which is rather low compared with the global rate of 0.016 percent. Even if the ""missing"" suicides were added, China's suicide rate in 2009 would still be below 0.008 percent.[:Zxxk.Com] Jing has found that one of the main reasons why the suicide rate has dropped was the steady and big decline in the number of suicides committed by rural women. In the early years, researchers generally agreed that the suicide rate among Chinese women was higher than among men, which is pretty rare in the rest the world. But the suicide rate among Chinese women, especially in rural areas, has declined remarkably in recent years. In fact, it is almost equal to that of Chinese men. As a sociologist, Jing regards suicide as a social issue, and believes improvement of social policies will reduce the suicide rate even further. More people's lives can be saved if the authorities adjust to social environment for the better, he concludes."	['Continue to improve social environment.']
This passage is mainly about _ .	"American and British people both speak English of course. But sometimes it does not seem like the same language. In fact, there are some important differences between British English and American English. First of all, they sound very different. Often, Americans don't say each word separately. They say several words together. Americans may say ""I dunno"" instead of ""I don't know"". Or they may say ""Whaddya say?"" instead of ""What did you say?"" however, the British are more careful in their speech. They usually say all the words and keep them _ . Words sometimes have different meanings too. Some American words are never used in England. The same thing is true of some British words in America. For example, the vocabulary for cars and driving is very different. Americans drive trucks, but in England people drive lorries. Many expressions are also different in the two countries. In England, if you are going to telephone your friends, you ""phone them up"". In America, you ""give them a call"". There're also some differences in grammar. For example, when Americans ask a question., they say ""Do you have a storybook?"" But the British often say ""Have you a storybook?"" All these differences can be confusing if you are learning English. But most languages are like this. Languages change over time. When people live in separate places, the languages change in different ways. This is what has happened to English. It can also happen to other languages, such as French. Many people in Canada speak French but their French is very different from the French of France."	['some differences between American and British English']

They could swim, fish, play the guitar and sleep in the quiet place at night. They enjoyed themselves there. On the third morning they decided to get back to the land. But their boat hit a rock and soon went down. With the villager's help, they swam to the bank. Luckily none of them was hurt. They took a taxi and half an hour later they arrived at our town, but it was two in the night. The young man was hungry and thirsty. He wished to get home as soon as possible. Something was wrong with the lift, so he had to go up the stairs. He stopped by my door and brought out a key. Of course he could not open the door. Half an hour passed but he failed. He became angry and shouted, ""I'll cut you down with a knife!"" The noise woke me up and I opened the door.

The purpose of the text is to _ .	"Maybe you love them and want to pet every one you see.Or maybe you're afraid of them and want to move to a dogfree neighborhood.Either way,dogs are a part of life.Millions of people have dogs as pets.You'll see them all over town,in the city,country,and even when you're on vacation.

The passage tells us that the expression was first used by _ .	"When someone says, ""Well, I guess I'll have to go to face the music,"" it doesn't mean he is planning to go to a concert. It is something far less pleasant, like being called in your boss to explain why you did this and did that, and why you did not do this or that. Terrible music, indeed, but it has to be faced. At some time or another, every one of us has had to ""face the music"", especially as children. We can remember father's angry voice: ""I want to talk to you!"" And only because we did not obey him. What an unpleasant business it was! The phrase ""face the music"" is known to every American, old and young. It is at least one hundred years old. Where did the expression come from? The first explanation came from the American novelist James Fenimore Cooper. He said, in 1851, that expression was first used by actors while waiting in the wings to go on stage. After they got their clue to go on , they often said, ""It's time to go to face the music."" And that is exactly what they did face the orchestra which was just below the stage. An actor might be frightened or nervous as he moved on to the stage in front of the audience that might be friendly, or perhaps unfriendly, especially if he forgot his . But he had to go out. If he did not, there would be no play. So ""face the music"" came to mean: having to go through something, no matter how unpleasant the experience might be, because you knew you had no choice."

What can we say about the discovery of Mangrove Rivulus?	"A fish that lives in America can live out. of water for months at a time, similar to how animals got used to land millions of years ago, a new study shows. The Mangrove Rivulus, a kind of little fish, lives in small pools of water. When their living place dries up, they live. on the land, said Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida. The fish can grow as large as three inches. They group together and breathe air through their skin before they can find water again. The new scientific discovery came during a trip. ""We were travelling for fun. and one day I kicked over a log and the fish came out,"" Taylor told reporters by telephone. He said he would make his study on the fish known to the public in an American magazine early next year. In lab tests, Taylor said he found the fish can live up to 66 days out of water without eating. Some other fish can live out of water for a short period of time. The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time, while lungfish found in Australia, Africa and South America can live out of water, but only in a not active way. But no other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and keep active, according to Patricia Wright, a biologist at a Canadian University. More studies of the fish may tell how animals changed over time. ""These animals live in conditions similar to those millions of years ago, when animals began to move from water onto land,"" Wright said."	['It was made by a researcher while travelling.']
When the University of Cambridge was set up, _ .	As the oldest university in the English-speaking world, Oxford is a unique and historic institution. There is no clear date of foundation, but teaching existed at Oxford in some form in 1096 and developed rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. From 1878, academic halls were established for women and they were admitted to full membership of the University in 1920. Five all-male colleges first admitted women in 1974. St Hilda's College, which was originally for women only, was the last of Oxford's single sex colleges. It has admitted both men and women since 2008. By 1200, the town of Cambridge had at least one school of some distinction. Then, in 1209, some scholars settled there. By 1226 the scholars were numerous enough to have set up an organisation, and seem to have arranged regular courses of study, taught by their own members. From the start there was conflict between the town and the students. Students, usually aged about fourteen or fifteen, often caused disturbances; citizens of the town, on the other hand, were known to overcharge for rooms and food. King Henry III took the scholars under his protection as early as 1231 and arranged for them to be sheltered from exploitation by their landlords. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. The current 168-acre campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. On April 29, 1911, Tsinghua Xuetang began its first term of study, and from that year on, the Tsinghua's anniversary has fallen on the last Sunday of April. Following the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in 1937, Tsinghua University, Peking University and Nankai University combined to form the National Southwest Associated University in Kunming. After the war, Tsinghua University moved back to its original Beijing campus.	['King Henry III gave much help']
What's the main idea of the passage?	"When I was a foreign teacher in China,every day I taught English to my students and they taught me about China.One day the topic mined to saying ""I love you"".I was shocked to learn that not one of my students had said this to their mothers,nor had their mothers said it to them.""Does your mom love you?"" ""Of course,""they answered. ""How do you know?"" was my logical question.They responded that their moms cooked and Always told them what they were doing wrong to show their earning.I was strummed. So mom's cooking and criticizing read our as ""I love you"".""Then how do you say 'I love you to her?"" They agreed that getting good grades, followed by good jobs would be how they showed their love. I come from a culture where most people are expressive enough,so I repeated these queries in clauses over time.Gradually,I began to get different responses.Some of them had exchanged those sentiments with their moms. One of my favorite stories of change came from a girl.When she came home from university,her mother met her at the door and hugged her.This had never happened before,but her mom said,""Now that you have gone I have more time to myself.I noticed that in some places mothers and children hug each other and I decided it was a good idea and that I would begin hugging you."" In my family we all say ""I love you"" a lot.While it is true that we often say the words without having great depth of feelings at that moment,it is almost like a blessing we give each other. Those three little words carry a world of meaning,even when said as a greeting, but most especially if they are the lax words we say to or hear from those we love."

Adrian's parents decided to send him to a regular school because _ .	"Adrian's ""Amazing Race"" started early when his parents realized that he, as a baby, couldn't hear a thing, not even loud noises. In a special school for the hearing-impaired, he learned sign language and got to mix with other disabled children. However, the sight of all the disabled children communicating with one another upset his mother. She wanted him to lead a normal life. So after speaking to an advisor, she sent him to private classes where he learned to read lips and pronounce words. Later on, Adrian's parents decided to send him to a regular school. But the headmaster tried to prevent them from doing so, saying regular school couldn't take care of a special needs students. His parents were determined to take the risk and push him hard to go through his work everyday because they wanted to prove that, given the opportunity, he could do anything. Adrian made the grade and got accepted. It was a big challenge. The pace was faster so he had to sit at the front of the class and really pay attention to the teacher, which wasn't always easy. But he stuck to it and did a lot of extra work after school. The efforts made by Adrian and his parents paid off. Adrian graduated with good grades and got into a top high school. He also achieved a lot in life outside school. He developed a love for the outdoors and went to Nepal to climb mountains. He even entered the World Yacht Race 05/06--- being the first hearing-impaired Asian to do so.

. The following statements are wrong EXCEPT _ according to the text.	What picture do you have of the future? Will life in the future be better, worse of the same as now? What do you hope about the future? Futurologists predict that life will probably be very different in 2050 in all the fields of activity, from entertainment to technology. First of all, it seems that TV channels will have disappeared by 2050. Instead, people will choose a programme from a menu and a computer will send the programme directly to the television. Today, we can use the World Wide Web to read newspaper stories and see pictures on a computer thousands of kilometers away. By 2050, music, films, programmes, newspapers and books will come to us by computer. In what concerns the environment, water will have become one of our most serious problems. In many places, agriculture is changing and they are growing fruit and vegetables to export. This uses a lot of water. Demand for water will increase ten times between now and 2050 and there could be serious shortages. Some futurologists predict that water could be the cause of war if we don't act now. In transport, cars will run on new, clean fuels and they will go very fast. Cars will have computers to control the speed of the car and there won't be any accidents. Today, many cars have computers that tell the drivers exactly where they are. By 2050, the computer will control the car and drive it to your destination. On the other hand, space planes will take people half way around the world in two hours. Nowadays, the United States Shuttle can go into space and land on Earth again. By 2050, space planes will fly all over the world and people will fly from Los Angels to Tokyo in just two hours. In the field of technology, robots will have replaced people in factories. Many factories already use robots. Big companies prefer robots -- they do not ask for pay rises or go on strike, and they work 24 hours a day. By 2050, we will see robots everywhere -- in factories, schools, offices, hospitals, shops and homes. In particular, medicine technology will have conquered many diseases. Today, there are electronic devices that connect directly to the brain to help people hear. By 2050, we will be able to help blind and deaf people see again and hear again and scientists will be able to produce clones of people and decide how they look, how they behave and how much intelligence they have. Scientists will be able to do these things -- but should they?	['Fewer and fewer workers are needed in the future in factories.']
What do we learn about H1N1 from the passage?	"There is a joke among flu researchers: ""If you've seen one flu season, you've seen one flu season."" The joke is about the unpredictable nature of the flu virus. Every year it looks different, and everystrain follows its own pattern -- it's the reason why new strains like H1N1 are extremely difficult to predict. Dr. Michael Osterholm is a former adviser to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ""I know less about influenza today than I did 10 years ago,"" he says in a joking way. ""Every stone we've turned over, we get more questions."" The flu rectums every season and the world experiences terriblepandemics , but researchers still do not understand why some strains infect people and others do not; they are not entirely sure about how the flu is transmitted; nor do they understand why some patients become seriously ill while others develop mildsymptoms . As a result, when a new strain shows up -- like H1N1 -- they often have little information to _ , and the lessons of previous pandemics are only somewhat helpful. While researchers are still putting together a complete picture of H1N1, for example, its most striking difference with the seasonal flu is that the elder1y are not the mostvulnerable population. Influenza's unpredictable nature makes it a moving target for researchers, says researcher Allison Aiello at the University of Michigan. ""Even if we had complete seasonal flu data from the past, it wouldn't be much helpful for a new strain of influenza,"" she explains. Whi1e researchers are frustrated by the holes in their knowledge, they say, however, that the pub1ic--health community is generally doing a very good job responding to H1N1 with seasonal flu data that do exist. Studying influenza, says Osterholm, is ""like looking through the windows of a house you can't get into because the door is locked."" Gathering the data researchers do have is like ""looking through the windows to get a pretty good picture of what the inside looks like."" One thing researchers do know for sure: the best way for people to protect against H1N1 is to get the vaccine once it becomes available to them."

What would be the best title for the passage?	"In a recent class I was asked ""What is a short story?"" My first answer was that it was something that could be read in one sitting and brought an illumination to the reader, sudden and golden like sunlight cracking(, ) through a heavy cloud.

One writer said, ""The theme of a novel won't fit into the framework of a short story; It's like trying to squeeze a large painting done on a wall into the frame of a miniature . And as in a miniature painting, the details need to be sharp. "" The short story is an example of one aspect of human nature. Often a character _ some event, something that offers him or her change. This is why it's said that short stories usually ""say something "", often a small something, but sometimes delivered with such accuracy that the effect is strongly felt, even a life-moment for some readers, something similar to a religious experience or to witnessing a never-to-be-repeated scene in nature. Ok, let's form a definition here: A short story is an account, rarely over 10, 000 words or below 500 words-more commonly 1, 500 to 5, 000 words-a single-sitting read, but with enough time and weight to move the reader. It is narrow and focused to produce an effect through the story, most commonly through events affecting some change in an individual. Writer Isabelle Allende once wrote: ""Novels are, for me, adding up details, just work, work, work, then you're done. Short stories are more difficult-they have to be perfect, complete in themselves.

What did the bird give Hungbu a year later?	Long ago, there was a rich man who had two sons. The older brother, who was called Nolbu, was greedy and lazy. However, his younger brother Hungbu was hard-working and kind-hearted. When their father died, Nolbu inherited his house and land, but Hungbu received nothing. One day when Hungbu was working in the fields, he found a bird which had broken its leg. He took the bird home and looked after it carefully. The bird gradually became stronger, and when summer came, it flew away to a warm place. A year later the bird flew back and gave Hungbu a seed . Hungbu sowed the seed and it soon grew into a plant which produced many gourds . When Hungbu opened one of the gourds, he was amazed to see that it was full of treasure. He wanted to use the treasure to do something useful. The next day he bought a big house and moved there with his family. When Nolbu heard about his brother's good luck, he was very jealous and decided to do the same as his brother. He also found a bird, but he broke its leg and looked after it until it became strong. The bird also gave him a seed, which produced several gourds. However, when Nolbu opened one of the gourds, goblins ( ) quickly came out of it and stole all his money. After that Nolbu went to his brother to ask for help. Hungbu was sorry for him and so he invited him to share his house. Both brothers and their families lived happily ever after.	['A seed.']
Where could this passage probably be found?	There is a very special wolf that lives in Africa. They are actually called, the African wild dog, of painted dogs. These animals live in open woodlands, or in the plains of Africa. Today, however, most of the animals can be found in eastern or southern Africa. These animals are beautiful. They have rounded ears instead of pointed like most dogs, and they have four toes on each of their four feet, also a unique characteristic because other dogs have five. Their fine fur is always different from each other. The fur is usually a combination of black, brown, red, and white, and sometimes even yellow. No wonder they're called the painted wolf. The African wild dog is a very social animal. They live in groups and have numbers from five to about twenty. The members of a group are always very close to one another. They communicate in their own language or body language. When someone is very old or sick, the others will help, and they are willing to share the food with the elders and with those who are weak, which is what we should learn from. The family does everything together, from raising young, to sleeping together, to hunting. When they hunt, they will work together suing team work to kill animals that are larger than them. They sometimes hunt farm animals. This is unfortunate, because both poachers , and people who own farms shoot the painted dogs who are just trying to survive. Before, there used to be many large groups throughout the land, but now the African wild god is very rare. They are also losing their population because of their own loss of habitat thanks to human's farming and forest cutting.	['Animal World']
People at California's Glace Luxury Ice Company probably want consumers to believe that _ .	"Many people believe that all ice cubes are created equal, but they are not. At least that's what the folks at California's Glace Luxury Ice Company would like us to believe. The Davisbased company says that the ice cubes they make are healthier and last longer than the ones that we throw into our drinks on a daily basis. What's more, the company also says that their ice cubes do mot leave behind an aftertaste in drinks, like regular ones do. In order to create these unique ice cubes, Glace Luxury begins with water that has been rid of the _ impurities that the company says can lead to cancer and exist in regular ice. They then freeze it in large blocks. Once ready, the ice is carved into perfect cubes and each cube measures 2.5 inches across. Besides being healthier, these ice cubes apparently also take longer to melt. The company says that each ice cube can last up to 30 minutes. Of course, those ice cubes do not come cheap. Those that wish to have a taste of this ""tasteless"" frozen perfection will have to pay $325USD for a bag of 50 ice cubes. That comes to $6.50USD for a single cube of ice! The unique product is the brainchild of Robert Sequeira, a former business school lecturer who said that he wanted to establish a profitable business that could be easily scaled. Given that he can make as mush Glace Luxury ice as he needs for as little as $0.12USD per cube, he thinks that the idea certainly meets the standard. Now, if he can find that the few people can afford to buy this Glace Luxury ice, life would be great!"	['their ice cubes are different']
Which of the following measures can't solve the heat wave disaster in Paris?

Why do people on the Channel Islands follow French way of living?	The Channel Islands are a group of British-owned islands lying in the English Channel 10 to 30 miles off the French coast, and 70 to 90 miles from the English coast. There are ten islands with a total land area of 75 square miles and a total population of 123,000. The three largest islands, Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney, have long been known for the fine breeds of cattle that are raised on them and named after them. In earliest known history the islands were considered part of Normandy, which was part of France, but the ruler of Normandy became king of England in 1066, and from then on the islands were looked upon as British land. English control was unbroken until World War II, when the Germans held the islands for five years. Although people on the islands speak both languages and they are considered English, their customs are more French than English.	['Their islands used to be part of France.']
Who is the passage written for?	If a child has a learning problem before he leaves the Second or Third Grade, it's difficult for him to study well. ADHD is one of the most common learning disabilities. Even with parents and doctors working together without schools' help, it is very hard to get rid of the disability. Sadly, even today, there are many schools that don't know how to deal with the children with these disabilities. Fairfield Primary School is a good place for children that have been diagnosed with ADHD. The teachers really care about all of their students and they are willing to work with parents and doctors in order to help these children. When they see the child want to act up in class, they usually give the child something physical to do in order to get rid of the excess energy. They never punish the child for something that is beyond the child's control. Overall, Fairfield Primary School has all of things that a child with ADHD needs. They provide interesting class games for the child's excess energy. They also provide the school rules the child needs. They give the child a caring environment where they are not kept apart because they are different. This is a very good school for a child who is suffering from one or more of these problems. We believe your child with ADHD can learn, change and succeed if they come to study in Fairfield Primary School.	['Parents']
Which statement is NOT true according to the passage?	"In the office of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, there is a picture of Catherine the Great, the legendary Russian Empress. When asked why she has the picture, Merkel says, ""She was a strong woman"". Many say the same of Merkel. The most powerful woman in the world, according to US Forbes magazine, was in China last week. She came to discuss trade and environmental issues with China's top leaders. Germany's first woman leader is known as a brave and practical statesman . Even since her time at school, she had the habit of getting everything in order. Every day before doing her homework she would clean the desk and think about what to do next. ""I prefer a long time for full preparations to make my decision. But once I decide, I will stand up for what I believe,"" Merkel said. Perhaps it was good habits that helped her do well in her studies. At 32, she got a doctorate in physics and then she worked as a researcher. However, the life of a scholar couldn't put off her love of politics. While working in labs, Merkel took time off to read political books and at last joined a political party. ""Her calmness helped her stand out in the party. She could always find a way out while others felt hopeless,"" said one of her old friends. In her first big political job as Minister for the Environment in 1994, her scientific background proved very useful. In 2005 she became Germany's youngest chancellor since the second World War. Now half way through her four-year term, the 53-year-old woman has made a name for herself both in Germany and abroad. At the EU summit in 2005 when France quarreled with Britain over the EU budget , some people believed the EU was close to breaking down. But Merkel didn't give up. She shuttled between the heads of the two powers and had them reached an agreement. ""Strength comes from composure and courage. Many people say I am a strong woman. But I would rather say I have perseverance,"" said Merkel."	['Merkel usually is hurry to make a decision when facing difficulties.']

We learn from what Scott Seider says in Paragraph 3 that young people today _ .	"Harvard student Julie Zauzmer turned 20 on January 22, and her birthday couldn't have been better: She got to working the overnight shift at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter. That might seem an extraordinary act of selflessness for someone turning 20. But there's increasing evidence that commitment to community service is becoming much more ordinary to today's young adults. ""Young adults are doing more volunteer service than in any point in history,'' said Scott Seider, an assistant professor of education at Boston University who studies the civic development of young adults. At Harvard, the Winthrop Street Homeless Shelter is one of 86 social service programs associated with the Phillips Brooks House Association, which is a student-run nonprofit organization. Students can work with deaf children, bring pets to nursing homes, and prepare Chinese students to become US citizens, and so on. Volunteerism develops well outside of colleges, too. Applications to AmeriCorps have risen to a very high level, jumping from 91,399 in 2008 to 258,829 in 2010. City Year, which puts young people in high-poverty schools as tutors and mentors for at-risk students, has had a 140 percent increase in applications since its 2007-2008 service year. Citizen Schools, which uses volunteers to work with students in middle schools, has had a 28 percent jump in applicants between 2008 and 2009. ""Most of my friends know it's their duty to give back before they settle down,'' said Samantha Wolf, a 23-year-old Boston University graduate serving with City Year in a Mattapan school. City Year corps member Antonio Gutierrez, 22, graduated last year from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., and is applying for admission to law schools, but this year he is tutoring and mentoring students at the Blackstone Elementary School in the South End. ""I grew up in similar circumstances,'' said Gutierrez, who said he was a weak student until enrichment programs changed his academic trajectory . Raised by a single mother in low-income housing across the street from City Year's South End Headquarters, he used to watch the red-jacketed corps members come and go, and decided to become one someday."

Internet bars or computer game bars _ within 200 meters of a school gate.	"Enjoying a better life at school, with shorter class hours, greater privacy and more rights is all you dream of, right? For students in Shanghai, they are no longer just dreams. This week experts and law-makers in Shanghai had a meeting to talk about a new law . It is called the ""Shanghai Underage Protection Law "". The law says students' diaries and letters are their secrets and ""Nobody can read them if they don't agree."" Do your teachers sometimes say something bad to you? Maybe they send you out of the classroom because you fail to finish doing your homework. If this happens in Shanghai, you can stand up and say ""No"". Shanghai students may have less homework because of the law. Class hours may become shorter for juniors next year, down from 45 minutes to 40 minutes in some schools. The law also talks about students' health. According to the rules,""Smoking in these places full of kids is not allowed.""That means you can ask your teacher to stop if he smokes in a classroom. The law makes schools safer for students. ""No dancing halls, Internet bars or computer game bars are allowed within(......)200 meters of a school gate."" the law says. The law is great, right?

Why do we need to do warm-up exercise?	People are busy working every day, so they do not have enough time to do exercise. As a result, many people become too fat or too thin. To keep our bodies healthy, we have to do exercise every day. There are many kinds of exercises. Bending and stretching helps us move easily. Before we play ball games or swim, it is better for us to do bending and stretching exercises first. This kind of exercise is something called warm-up exercise. Running is also a good exercise. If we cannot run fast, we can jog. Jogging means running slowly Again, before we run or jog, we must do warm-up exercise. Also, we should not run or jog in busy streets. The air there is often dirty. Some people like weight lifting because it can make their bodies strong. Also, we need to do warm-up exercise before weight lifting.	['To help us avoid hurting ourselves']
From the passage we can learn that the little girl's father _ .	It was terribly cold and nearly dark on the last evening of the old year, and the snow was falling fast. In the cold and the darkness, a poor little girl, with bare head and naked feet, wandered through the streets. It is true she had on a pair of slippers when she left home, but they were not of much use. They were very large, so large, indeed, that they had belonged to her mother, and the poor girl had lost them in running across the street to avoid two carriages that were rolling along at a terrible rate. One of the slippers she could not find, and a boy seized upon the other and ran away with it. So the little girl went on with her little naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold. In an old apron she carried a number of matches, and had a bunch of them in her hands. No one had bought anything of her the whole day, nor had any one given her even a penny. Lights were shining from every window, and there was a delicious smell of roast goose, for it was New-year's eve--yes, she remembered that. In a corner, between two houses, one of which projected beyond the other, she sank down and huddled herself together. She had drawn her little feet under her, but she could not keep off the cold; and she dared not go home, for she had sold no matches, and could not take home even a penny of money. Her father would certainly beat her; besides, it was almost as cold at home as here.	['is cruel to her']
"Which of the following isn't mentioned as a result of the ""Loma Prieta Earthquake""?"	"Experts know that a disaster is coming but they do not know when it will happen. They do know that it could cause a lot of damage. They think it will be worse than a hurricane. The disaster they are worried about is an earthquake. There is a break in the earth's crust . It is called the San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas Fault is in California. Many earthquakes happen along the San Andreas Fault. In 1989 there was a big earthquake on the fault. The earthquake was called the ""Loma Prieta Earthquake"". Many people were hurt or died. Many buildings were ruined. Lots of people lost their homes. Roads and bridges were also damaged. A large earthquake could happen in Southern California. Many small earthquakes have happened in the last year. Earthquake experts think that a large earthquake will happen there soon. They think a big earthquake will happen in the next few years. The San Andreas Fault has many power lines stretched across it. There are water channels close to the earthquake fault. A large earthquake in Southern California would destroy energy and water supplies . Lots of people would be without power or water for weeks. Buildings that have not been built strong enough would be destroyed. Not all hospitals would be able to help people who were injured. Many people would die or be homeless. People need to be prepared. They need to know what to do if an earthquake happens. Everyone in California should have a survival kit at home. The emergency kit would include food and water. There should be medication and first aid supplies in the kit. A good survival kit will also have a portable radio, flashlights and spare batteries. All of the supplies in the kit should last at least 3 days."	['Lots of animals lost their living areas.']
How do kangaroos rest when they want to rest?	You can see lots of kangaroos in Australia, and not only in zoos but also outside the cities and towns. You can see them everywhere. Kangaroos are very popular in Australia. They have very strong legs, so they are very good at jumping. Their tails are very strong, too, so when they want to have a rest, they rest on their tails. Kangaroos are also good at looking after their babies. Mother kangaroos keep their babies safe in their pockets.	['on their tails']
Which of the following would be the best title for the text?	"Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to link the brain with computers.Brain-computer interface(BCI) technology could help people with disabilities send commands to machines. Recently, two researchers, Jose Millan and Michele Tavella from the Federal Polytechnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland, demonstrated a small robotic wheelchair directed by a person's thoughts. In the laboratory, Tavella operated the wheelchair just by thinking about moving his left or right hand.He could even talk as he watched the vehicle and guided it with his thoughts. ""Our brain has billions of nerve cells.These send signals through the spinal cord to the muscles to give us the ability to move.But spinal cord injuries or other conditions can prevent these weak electrical signals from reaching the muscles,"" Tavella says.""Our system allows disabled people to communicate with external world and also to control devices."" The researchers designed a special cap for the user.This head cover picks up the signals from the scalp and sends them to a computer.The computer interprets the signals and commands the motorized wheelchair. The wheelchair also has two cameras that identify objects in its path.They help the computer react to commands from the brain. Prof.Millan, the team leader, says scientists keep improving the computer software that interprets brain signals and turns them into simple commands.""The practical possibilities that BCI technology offers to disabled people can be grouped in two categories: communication, and controlling devices.One example is this wheelchair."" He says his team has set two goals.One is testing with real patients, so as to prove that this is a technology they can benefit from.And the other is to guarantee that they can use the technology over long periods of time."

Why did the author write the passage?	While I was on a trip to Papua New Guinea to take underwater photographs, I asked a local dive guide to help me find a pygmy sea horse . I wanted to take a picture of it. These sea horses can be red or yellow-and-orange. The red pygmy sea horse lives on only one type of coral, a red sea fan that grows at depths below ninety feet. This depth made the job even tougher. As the pressure on my body increased, I had to breathe harder, which used my air supply faster. So the deeper I dived, the shorter my time underwater. I had a lot to do. First, I had to find the pygmy sea horse's special type of fan .Then I had to look over the whole fan with my magnifying glass to see if a sea horse lived on it. If not, I had to find another fan--all the while keeping an eye on my oxygen supply. The second fan rewarded me with a find. The dive guide held the magnifying glass so I could have my first look at the tiny fish. My next challenge was to focus my camera on such a small subject. The dive guide pointed at the tiny creature. I looked through the viewfinder on my large underwater camera housing , found the guide's finger, and followed it to the sea horse. It was hard to hold ourselves steady because both of us were floating in mid-water, but our system worked. I could hardly contain my excitement as I focused on the eyes of the cutest sea horse imaginable.	['To show us how she took pictures of a sea horse.']
The author later frequently went into the little shop _ .	"I met him first in 1936. I rushed into his ugly little shop to have the heels of my shoes repaired. I waited when he did it. He greeted me with a cheerful smile. ""You're new in this neighborbood, aren't you?"" I said I was. I had moved into a house at the end of the street only a week before. ""This is a fine neighborhood,"" he said. ""You'll be happy here."" He looked at the leather covering the heel sadly. It was worn through because I had failed to have the repair done a month before. I grew impatient, for I was rushing to meet a friend. ""Please hurry,"" I begged. He looked at me over his spectacles. ""Now, lady, we won't be long. I want to do a good job. You see, I have a tradition to live up to."" A tradition? In this ugly little shop that was no different from so many other shoe repair shops on the side streets of New York? He must have felt my surprise, for he smiled as he went on. ""Yes, lady, I _ a tradition. My father and my grandfather were shoemakers in Italy, and they were the best. My father always told me, 'Son, do the best job on every shoe that comes into the shop, and be proud of your fine work. Do that always, and you'll have both happiness and money enough to live on.'"" As he handed me the finished shoes, he said: ""These will last a long time. I've used good leather."" I left in a hurry. But I had a warm and grateful feeling. On my way home I passed the little shop again. There he was, still working. He saw me, and to my surprise he waved and smiled. This was the beginning of our friendship. It was a friendship that came to mean more and more to me as time passed. Every day I passed his shop, we waved to each other in friendly greeting. At first I went in only when I had repair work to be done. Then I found myself going in every few days just to talk with him. He was the happiest man I've ever known. Often, as he stood in his shopwindow, working at a pair of shoes, he sang in a high, clear Italian voice. The Italians in our neighborhood called him la luce alla finestra--""the light in the window"". One day I was disappointed and angry because of poor jobs some painters had done for me. I went into his shop for comfort. He let me go on talking angrily about the poor work and carelessness of present-day workmen. ""They had no pride in their work,"" I said. ""They just wanted to collect their money for doing nothing."" He agreed. ""There's a lot of that kind around, but maybe we should not blame them. Maybe their fathers had no pride in their work. That's hard on a boy. It keeps him from learning something important."" He waited a minute and said ""Every man or woman who hasn't inherited a prideful tradition must start building one."" ""In this country, our freedom lets each of us make his own contribution. We must make it a good contribution. No matter what sort of work a man does, if he gives it his best each day, he's starting a tradition for his children to live up to. And he is making lots of happiness for himself."" I went to Europe for a few months. When I returned, there was no ""light in the window"". The door was closed. There was a little sign: ""Call for shoes at shop next door."" I learned the old man had suddenly got sick and died two weeks before I went away with a heavy heart. I would miss him. But he had left me something--an important piece of wisdom I shall always remember: ""If you inherited a prideful tradition, you must carry it on; if you haven't, start building one now."""

Hugs can benefit people in the following ways EXCEPT _ .	"A hug is a wonderful thing and it is a great gift to share with people. For some people, a hug is considered to be a great way to say ""I care."" A hug communicates support, affection , unity and belonging. A hug shows a strong feeling of sympathy. A hug brings happiness. A hug also touches the soul. Hugs are healthy. Hugs can ease pain, reduce stress, cure depression and refresh the heart, yet they have no side effects...No wonder, it is a true miracle medicine. A hug can say ""I love you""...A hug can say ""I hate to see you go"". A hug can say "" It's good to have you back"". A hug can say ""It's great to see you'. A hug can say ""I feel your pain"". A hug can also say ""Let me share your burden"". No matter whether you're the giver or the receiver, hugs touch the inner being. From friends, to families, to loved ones, to those in need, a hug warms the heart. A hug is truly amazing. It brings generosity to the giver and happiness to the receiver. It brings blessings to those who give and joy to those who receive. Hugs are one of the reasons why God gave us arms. So, stretch out your arms to someone today. Reach out to those you love. It will warm the heart of the giver and give light to the soul of the receiver. Reach out to your neighbor. It will show that you care. Reach out to one in need. It will show that you are responsible. Reach out to the world. It will show God that you care for his creation."	['creating great wealth']
Those who want to move to Australia have to answer _ questions right	"Australia is largely a nation of immigration , with one in four of Australia's 21 million population born overseas. But immigrations hoping to become Australian citizens will soon have to take a test examining their knowledge of the country's history and institutions. While Australia prides itself on its multicultural background, the government wants newcomers to integrate more fully . Form later this year, new immigrants will have to show an understanding of the English language. They will also be required to answer 20 questions from a list of 200. Anyone who gives fewer than 12 correct responses will not be accepted. Immigrants will also have to accept what the government considers to be 10 important Australia values, including ""mateship"" and ""giving people a fair go"". Other important Australia values are said to include tolerance, compassion, gender equality and freedom of speech. The new citizenship application procedures are detailed in a 40-pages booklet . It describes Australia as ""a nation at ease with the world and itself"" but says that newcomers are expected to respect its values. The booklet sums up mateship as voluntary helping and receiving help from others, especially in difficult times. The immigration Minister said they aimed to achieve a balance between ethnic diversity and social stability , ""particularly as we now draw people from so many different countries and so many different cultures"". Critics have attacked the English language requirement, pointing out many immigrants could not speak English when they arrived. But the minister said, ""We are trying to encourage people to learn English, because we think that is the way they will achieve their dreams in Australia."""	['12']
How many kinds of videos did Jerry buy?	Jerry Baldwin was 63 years old. He was manager of a pizza restaurant in America. He lived in an apartment about one mile north of the restaurant. He walked to and from the work. When it was rainy, he took the bus. Jerry loved gangster movies. When a new one came out, he would go to the theatre and watch the new movie three or four times. Jerry would also buy videos at Barney's Video Store. Jerry had a home collection of over 1,000 gangster videos. Old ones, new ones, color, black and white, English, Spanish, Japanese - he loved them all. He could tell you the names, the directors, the stars and all the details of the movies. And then he would invite you to his place to watch a gangster film some time. He was a nice man. Jerry finally decided that he would like to own a gun, just like the gangster. So he saved money for some months. Then he went to a gun store and bought a used revolver for $ 300. While there, he also bought a lot of bullets . The following Saturday morning, he went to the gun club for only ten minutes when the accident happened. The gun went off, and the bullet went into Jerry's right knee.	['Four.']
Why didn't the bailiff hit Hans?	"All boys and girls like good stories. I am sure that all children who read The Ugly Duckling will be glad to know something about the 'King of Story Tellers', who wrote it for them. Thousands and thousands of children have read this story, only to ask for it again and again. It has travelled the wide world over, and has been told in every country. Hans Christian Andersen, the author of ""The Ugly Duckling,"" was born in Denmark. If you look on a map, you will see this little country in northern Europe. There, in the little village of Odense, he spent his boyhood. His father and mother were very poor. The family lived in two little rooms near the top of a house, where his father worked as a shoemaker. On the roof was a box filled with earth. In this box his mother planted her vegetables. Little Hans loved to walk with his father in the woods, where he could pick wild flowers and hear the birds sing. His father read to him when his work was done, or told him stories. What his father did helped him open up a new world. Once, when Hans was still a child, he went into a wheat field with his mother and a number of children, to pick the rest wheat which the reapers had left in the field. While they were busy picking only a small amount of wheat for each of them, an angry bailiff came rushing into the field, armed with a whip . All ran, as fast as they could, away from the angry man. _ and the sharp stalks of the wheat plants which had been cut down, cut his feet so that he could not get away. Unafraid, the boy faced the angry man and his upraised whip. ""How dare you hit me when you know God sees you?"" he cried, looking fearlessly into the face of the angry bailiff. The whip came down, but not on little Hans. The bailiff admired the boy's courage, and praised him for it. He sent him home with gifts, rather than punishments.[:] While Hans was still a boy, his kind father died. Then Hans and his mother were left alone, to care for each other. ""What will you do, Hans?"" the mother asked ""Would you like to become a tailor?"" ""No, mother,"" the boy answered; ""I will go to Copenhagen and study. One day I shall write books."" ""But where will the money be found to pay your way?"" asked the mother. ""I will work, and God will take care of me,"" Hans replied. So the boy left his native village and walked all the way to Copenhagen, which was very far."	"[""Because he admired Hans' courage.""]"
According to the passage, the introduction of the Next Gen Researchers Act is intended to _ .	"Wisconsin has long been home to incredibly successful research and innovation thanks to our famous academic research institutions and some of the brightest scientific minds. From discovering how Vitamin D can best be absorbed, to unlocking the potential of stem cells, Wisconsin has pioneered remarkable breakthroughs in science that have improved health, saved lives and created jobs. These scientific breakthroughs have not only led to life-saving medical technologies but also have fostered a strong power in Wisconsin economy. Across America, groundbreaking research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone adds millions of dollars to our economy every year. In fact, NIH funding generated an estimated $58 billion in economic output nationwide in 2014. NIH funding spurs economic growth by supporting jobs in research and by generating biomedical innovations that are turned into new products. NIH-supported innovations also influence improvements in health that can bolster the economy, improve productivity, and reduce illness and disability at home and across the globe. But, budget cuts and inadequate funding for NIH in the past decade have put both medical innovation and our next generation of researchers at risk. Today, too many of our talented young scientists are deciding to do something else, or are leaving the country to pursue their research. Simply put, scientific and medical innovation depends on our ability to foster, support and invest in these new researchers. That is why I have worked across party lines with Senator Susan Collins of Maine and introduced the Next Generation (NextGen) Researchers Act. Our act builds opportunities for new researchers, helps address the debt burden that young scientists face today, and invests in the future of research, science, and innovation. This commonsense proposal would create the ""Next Generation Researchers Initiative"" within the NIH Office of the Director to coordinate all current and new NIH policies. The legislation also directs the NIH to consider recommendations from a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) comprehensive study and report on fostering the next generation of researchers. Finally, we must demonstrate a commitment to our future scientists who, like so many of their peers pursuing other fields, are struggling with crushing student loan debt. Our plan would also increase the amount of loans that can be forgiven through the NIH's loan repayment programs to better account for the current debt load of new scientists. Higher education should be a path to prosperity, not suffocating debt, and this provision not only helps make higher education more affordable, but can help give new researchers a fair shot at pursuing their dreams. The Next Gen Researchers Act will help to empower our next generation of researchers from Maine to Wisconsin, and across our country, with the resources they need to continue to lead the world in groundbreaking biomedical research and development. I'm proud to have earned the support of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Medical College of Wisconsin, and many others, for my bipartisan work supporting Wisconsin's leadership in science, research and innovation. At a time when America's young researchers are facing the worst funding in decades, our best and brightest minds deserve to know that our country stands with them and is committed to building a stronger future."

Whose artwork sold for the highest price on the mainland ?	A painting by Chinese artist Qi Baishi set a record for modern art andcalligraphy on the mainland when it sold for 425.5 millionyuanat anauction on May 22. The sale was a milestone in the auction of modern and contemporary artworks. The price meant its value had risen more than 2,000 per cent in six years . The work ,Eagle standing on pine tree with four-character coupleti , measures about 2.6 metres by 1 metre . It was the second highest price paid for an artwork on the mainland . A Song dynasty work by Huang Tingjian was sold for 436.8 millionyuanin 2010 . Qi's painting was finished in 1946 when Qi was 86 , and was his largest work . With a starting price of 88 millionyuan, it attracted nearly 50bids in half an hour . Shanghai businessman Liu Yiqian said that the work had belonged to him and had cost less than 20 millionyuanin 2005 . The auction company said the work was brought back to the mainland after being bought from a private owner in San Francisco six years ago . China ranked first in global art sales last year , ahead of the United States and Britain . Four Chinese artists were among the top 10 in worldwide sales : Qi Baishi , Zhang Daqian , Xu Beihong and Fu Baoshi . Qi's works ranked second in sales to Pablo Picasso's last year . Qi was born into a peasant family in Hunan in 1864 . He taught himself to paint and focused on nature including plants , insects , birds and fish . He is mostly well-known for his paintings of shrimps . In 1953 , he was elected president of the Association of Chinese Artists . He died in Beijing in 1957 .	"[""Huang Tingjian's .""]"
Some kind of indoor pollution can be found in _ .	For years scientists have been worried about the effects of air pollution on the earth's natural conditions. Some believe the air inside many houses may be more dangerous than the air outside. It may be one hundred times worse. Indoor air pollution can cause a person to feel tired, to suffer eye pain, headache and other problems. Some pollutants can cause breathing disorders, diseases of blood and even cancer. Most scientists agree that every modern house has some kind of indoor pollution. People have paid more attention to the problem now. It is true that when builders began making houses and offices they did not waste energy. To do this they build buildings that limited the flow of air between inside and outside. They also began using man-made building materials. These materials are now known to let out harmful gases. As the problem became more serious, scientists began searching for a way to deal with it. They discovered a natural pollution control system for building--green plants. Scientists do not really know how plants control air pollution. They believe that a plant's leaves absorb or take in the pollutants. In exchange the plant lets out oxygen through its leaves and tiny organizations on its roots. Scientists suggest that all buildings should have one large plant or several small plants inside for every nine square meters of space. Studies of different plants show that each absorbs different chemicals. So the most effective way to clean the air is to use different kinds of plants. Having green plants inside your house can make it a prettier and healthier place.	['every modern house']
The people we meet _ .	Sometimes people come into your life and you know at once that they were sure to be there. They serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help find out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be: your classmate, neighbor, teacher, long-lost friend or even a real stranger. But you know that every moment they will affect your life in some serious way. Sometimes things happen to you. At the time they may seem terrible, painful and unfair. But later you realize that without getting over those difficulties you would have never realized your further ability and strength. Everything happens for a reason and nothing happens by chance or with good or bad luck. The people you meet affect your life, and the successes and failure you experience, create who you are. Even the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most _ and important ones. Enjoy every day even every moment and take from it everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again. Talk to people you have never talked to before, and really listen. You should set your sights high, hold your head up, tell yourself you are a great one and believe in yourself. You can make your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it. ,A, B, C, D.	['will change us in some way']
Why did the colors quarrel?	"Once upon a time the colors of the world started to quarrel. Green said, ""Clearly I am the most important. I am the sign of life and hope. I was chosen for grass, trees and leaves. Look over the countryside and you will see that I am in the majority."" Blue interrupted, ""You only think about the earth, but consider the sky and the sea. It is the water that is the basis of life."" Yellow chuckled . ""The sun is yellow, as well as the moon and the stars. Every time you look at a sunflower, the whole world starts to smile."" Red could bear it no longer. ""I am the ruler of all of you. I am blood-life's blood! I am the color of danger and bravery. I bring fire into the blood. I am the color of passion and love."" Purple stood at his full height. ""I am the color of royalty and power. I am the sign of authority and wisdom. People do not question me! They listen and obey."" Finally Indigo spoke with determination, ""Think of me and I am the color of silence. I represent thought and reflection. You need me for balance and contrast , for prayer and inner peace."" The colors went on boasting , each showing off his or her own advantages. Suddenlythere came a flash of bright lightening. Thunder rolled and boomed. Rain started to pour down. The colors were scared to death. In the midst of the quarrelling, rain began to speak, ""You foolish colors. Don't you know that you were each made for a special purpose, unique and different? Join hands with one another and come to me."" Doing as they were told, the colors united and joined hands. From then on, when it rains, colors will stretch across the sky in a great bow of color. Whenever a rainbow appears in the sky, let us remember to appreciate one another."	['Because they all claimed to be the best.']
We normally buy food on the basis _ .	Healthy food is a general term applied to all kinds of food that is considered healthier than the types of food sold in supermarkets. For example, whole grains, dried beans, and corn oil are health food. A narrower classification of healthy food is natural food. This term is used to distinguish between types of the same food. Raw honey is a natural sweetener, while refined sugar is not. Fresh fruit is a natural food, but canned fruit, with sugars and other additives is not. The most exact term of all and the narrowest classification within health food that has been grown on a particular kind of farm. Fruits and vegetable that are grown in gardens, that are treated only with organic fertilizers, that are not sprayed with poisonous insecticides , and that are not refined after harvest, are organic food. Meat, fish, dairy and poultry products from animals that are fed only on organically-grown food and that are not injected with hormones are organic food. In choosing the type of food you eat, then, you have basically two choices: inorganic, processed food, or organic, unprocessed food. A wise decision should include study of the reason why processed food contains chemicals, some of which are proved to be poisonous and that vitamin content is greatly reduced in processed food. Bread is typically used by healthy food supporters as an example of a processed food. First, the seeds from which the grain is grown are treated with a chemical that is extremely harmful. Later, the grain is sprayed with a number of very deadly insecticides. After the grain has been made into flour, it is made white with another chemical that is also poisonous. Next, a dough conditioner is added along with a softener. The conditioner and softener are poisonous, and in fact, the softener has sickened and killed experimental animals. A very poisonous antifungal compound, is added to keep the bread from getting moldy . Other food from the supermarket would show a similar pattern of processing and preserving . You see, we buy our food on the basis of smell, color1 and texture, instead of vitamin content, and manufacturers give us what we want, even if it is poisonous. The alternative? Eat health foods, preferably the organic variety.	['color1 and texture']
At the beginning of the passage, the author uses the stories to _ .	"When your pet meets your infant ,it might not be love at first sniff. When Jennifer brought her baby home from the hospital, her cherished dogs had very different reactions. Her Boxer, Sonya, was immediately gentle and protective. But Tiger, the Pomeranian, was less welcoming. ""If any diapers or toys were on the floor, he peed on them,"" says the Greenbrier, mom. In the eyes of a pet, there's a new star in home who's stealing his spotlight. Even the gentlest animal will probably act up if he doesn't get his usual attention. These simple steps will help your pet adjust and keep your baby safe. Introduce Them with Care Your newborn and per's first encounter can set the tone for their relationship. To make it as smooth as possible, try this trick from Caryn Ruiz:""Before we left the hospital, my husband took blankets home to our dog, Daisy, so she'd know our newborn Devon's smell."" When you get home, have your husband carry the baby so you can greet your pet without worrying about her jumping on you. A cat will likely walk away at first, while a dog probably wants to investigate right away. To introduce your baby, get down on your pet's level and let her have a hello sniff. Don't panic and pull your baby away unless your pet is barking or hissing, because it'll send the message that the baby is a threat. Learn the Safety Basics No matter how smoothly the introduction goes, there are certain safety rules you should follow. Never leave your baby alone with the pet. Even the gentlest animal can react unpredictably. Your baby's crying could frighten your cat, or your dog could suddenly become territorial. Consider setting up baby gates to limit your pet's access. To keep your cat from jumping into the bassinet , try putting mosquito netting over the top. Cats hate sticky paws, so keep the crib and changing table off-limits by lining the edges with sticky strips made for furniture. You can also train your dog to sleep in a crate ."

When did the drop of water fall on the ant?	"There was once an ant that was very thirsty. It ran here and there looking for some water but could not find any. Then suddenly, when the ant was almost ready to die of thirst, a large drop of water fell on it. The ant drank the water, which saved its life. The water was actually a tear from a young girl who was crying. Because of her sadness, the tear had magical qualities and suddenly the ant could speak the language of human beings. The ant looked up and saw the young girl sitting in front of a huge pile of seeds. ""Why are you sad?"" asked the ant. ""I'm the prisoner of a giant."" the girl told the ant. "" He won't let me go until I've made three separate heaps of grain, barley and rye out of this huge pile of seeds in which they are all mixed together."" ""That will take you a month!"" the ant said, looking at the huge pile of seeds. ""I know,"" the girl cried, ""and if I haven't finished by tomorrow, the giant will eat me for his supper!"" ""Don't cry,"" the ant said, ""my friends and I will help you."" Soon thousands of ants were at work, separating the three kinds of seeds. The next morning, when the giant saw that the work had been done, he let the girl go. Thus it was one of her tears that saved her life."	['When it was nearly dying.']
It's impolite to ask British people _ .	"The 30th Olympics will be held in London soon. More and more people will travel there and watch the games. And it's necessary for the tourists to know the customs there. Here are some tips given by William Hanson, an English manner expert. * Afternoon tea. The traditional view that the British sit down for an afternoon tea is not popular any more. Few people keep the tradition nowadays. * Give tips -- but not in a clear way. The British would like to choose a quiet way of saying ""thank you"" when they get good service. In fact, many British waiters will not mind if you decide not to tip at all. * Greeting with a kiss. The British aren't like their neighbors in France. They do not greet others with a kiss very often. Many people prefer to shake hands or pat on the back to say "" hello"" . * Conversation tips. If you are not sure what you are talking about, end a sentence with the word ""mate"". * Don't talk about money. According to Hanson, British people don't like to talk about money and it is rude to do so. Especially, never ask anyone how much money he or she makes a month."	['how much he or she makes a year']
It can be inferred from the passage that an atheist is a person _ .	"An atheist was taking a walk through the woods, admiring all that the ""accident of evolution"" had created. ""What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!"" he said to himself. As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. He turned to look. He saw a 7 - foot grizzly charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing. He ran even faster, so scared that tears were coming to his eyes. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pumping frantically and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him. At that instant the atheist cried out ""Oh my God!"" Time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. Even the river stopped moving. As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky,"" You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don't exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this difficulty? Am I to count you as a believer?"" The atheist looked directly into the light. ""It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian?""""Very well,"" said the voice. The light went out. The river ran again. And the sounds of the forest resumed. And then the bear dropped his right paw... brought both paws together... bowed his head and spoke, ""Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful."""

The habit of carrying a book was the habit of _ .	The tall man was sitting in the chair. He was reading a book. When I talked to him, I found that from boyhood , he had the habit of carrying a little book in his pocket. He often read every minute when he was not doing anything else. He found a book very useful during the time of waiting, such as waiting for meals, buses, doctors, telephone calls, plays to begin or something to happen. That was how he found his fifteen minutes a day for reading. That was how he read his twenty books a year --one thousand in his lifetime.	['the man']
Grasslands won't depend on chemical fertilizers when _ .	Grasslands need time to rest when cattle and other animals feed on them. Moving animals from one area of pasture to another can provide the time needed for new growth. This is called rotational grazing . Rotational grazing is good for the land and the animals, and it can save money. This form of grazing can reduce the need for pesticide treatments by reducing the growth of weeds. And it can limit the need for chemical fertilizers by letting animal wastes do the job of natural fertilizer. Rotational grazing can even help prevent wildfires by keeping grasslands in good condition. Letting animals feed continually and intensively in the same grazing areas can require costly replanting. Animals eat the most desirable growth first. When that keeps happening, the roots do not have enough time to recover. As a result, less desirable plants may replace them. Intensively used grasslands are also harmed as the soil is continually crushed under the weight of heavy animals. While rotational grazing can save money over time, it also requires planning. And that starts with a good map to mark fences, water supplies and grazing areas. Changing methods of grazing also requires time. Farmers may want to put up electric fences to enclose grazing areas, called paddocks. The paddocks will need water. Some farmers design a path for animals from different paddocks to drink from a common watering place. Farmers can start rotational grazing by removing animals from a pasture when the grass is eaten to less that five centimeters. The pasture is then kept empty until the grass grows to more than fifteen centimeters high. Sheep and goats may require special preparations. They may need stronger fences than other animals. And while they eat the grass, they may need guard animals to protect them from animals that would like to eat them.	['animal wastes serve as natural fertilizer']
Ray Birdwhistell can tell what region of the United States a person is from by .	Perhaps the most astonishing theory to come out of kinetics,the study of body movement,was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell.He believes that physical appearance Is often culturally programmed.In other words,we learn our looks;we are not born with them. A baby generally unformed facial features.A baby,according to Birdwhistell,learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around family and friends.This helps explain why the people of some regions of the United States look so much lilke.New Englanders or Southerners have certain common facial characteristics that cannot be explained by genetics .The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth,it is learned later.In fact,the final mouth shape is not formed until well after permanent teeth are set.For many,this can be well into adolescence .A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look somewhat alike.We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country there are areas where people smile more than those in other areas.In the United States,for example,the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently.In New England they smile less,and in the western part of New York State still less.Many Southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly,partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peach Tree Street jn Atlanta,Georgia.People in densely populated urban areas also tend to smile and greet each other in public less than people in rural areas and small towns.

The reason why the author offered a lift to the elderly man was that _ .	"In 1978, I was 18 and was working as a nurse in a small town about 270 km away from Sydney, Australia. I was looking forward to having five days off from duty. Unfortunately, the only one train a day back to my home in Sydney had already left. So I thought I'd hitch a ride . I waited by the side of the highway for three hours but no one stopped for me. Finally, a man walked over and introduced himself as Gordon. He said that although he couldn't give me a lift, I should come back to his house for lunch. He noticed me standing for hours in the November heat and thought I must be hungry. I was doubtful as a young girl but he assured(...) me I was safe, and he also offered to help me find a lift home afterwards. When we arrived at his house, he made us sandwiches. After lunch, he helped me find a lift home. Twenty-five years later, in 2003, while I was driving to a nearby town one day, I saw an elderly man standing in the glaring heat, trying to hitch a ride. I thought it was another chance to repay someone for the favor I'd been given decades earlier. I pulled over and picked him up. I made him comfortable on the back seat and offered him some water. After a few moments of small talk, the man said to me, ""You haven't changed a bit, even your red hair is still the same."" I couldn't remember where I'd met him. He then told me he was the man who had given me lunch and helped me find a lift all those years ago. It was Gordon."	['she wanted to repay the favor she once got']
The example of bin Laden is raised in order to .	"The announcement of Osama bin Laden's killing by U.S. Navy SEALs touched off a series of emotional reactions around the world, from joy to grief. For most Americans, it prompted a time of rejoicing, a magnificent sense of closure, and a feeling that justice had been done. But for those who were followers of bin Laden, there was anger, heightened feelings of revenge , and a deep sense of loss. How do we make meaning from such a moment in history? And how do we help children understand the deep values that unite us as a nation? This is indeed a teachable moment for families and for classrooms around the country. Reactions to murder can be very confusing to children because they are not able to morally reason like adults. Instead of understanding his killing as an act of justice, children may interpret it as an act of revenge. They can internalize joyful reactions to mean""When someone harms me or my family, it is okay to hurt them back.""Talking with children about this event is an important lesson in moral development. Adults can help children understand justice and revenge by talking about the values behind these two concepts. There are sticky issues here -- and sometimes there are no concrete answers! Getting kids to reflect on and discuss moral dilemmas is important to development. Justice is understood differently by different cultures, depending upon their history. At the core of justice are certain shared values about moral rightness, fairness, and ethics that ifbreachedpunishment will follow. Justice is an integral part of the American legal system, a foundation of how our culture thinks about crime and punishment. Justice is about how our actions have consequences. John Stuart Mill, a British philosopher, suggested that justice evolved from two natural human tendencies: revenge and empathy. Humans have natural empathy for people who are hurt. Indeed, the human loss from 9*11 was overwhelming to everyone, not just those who lost loved ones. Through our ability to put ourselves into another person's place, we feel a natural desire to revenge on those who hurt us. Thus, Mill believed the laws of justice evolved from the difference between empathy and revenge. What is the difference between justice and revenge? Justice is undertaken and supported by legitimate judicial systems founded on certain ethics and morals. It is meant to be restorative. On the other hand, revenge is often done to make others suffer the same or greater pain than that which was originally inflicted. It can be argued that the type of killing done by al-Qaeda is steeped in revenge because it is designed to inflict the greatest harm on innocent people. Helping children understand the meaning of justice and its underlying values is important. It develops a child's ability to develop skills in moral reasoning. And it helps them distinguish between concepts such as justice and revenge. When they are faced with their own moral dilemmas, they will be able to respond. An event like bin Laden's death and the intense emotions surrounding the event of 9*11 are different for each American household. Talk to your children about your feelings. Ask them about theirs. Perhaps they are too young to remember the day when the World Trade Center was attacked and the immense grief you felt. Tell them about that day. Talk about justice -- and the consequences of our actions. Share your own moral dilemmas and how you worked through them. Current events present an opportunity to talk about American values. It is also an occasion to talk about family values. How do your kids experience the consequences of their actions when they are dishonest, selfish, or treat others with disrespect. Families should initiate conversations about values and moral dilemmas often in a child's life. Families who create open environments for dialogue with children around values and meaning in life nurture kids who grow up to reason for themselves. Through respectful listening and conversations about moral dilemmas, you can help your child develop into a caring, sympathetic, engaged adult."	['introduce the topic']
Crocus was viewed as the symbol of _ by the writer.	"It was an autumn morning shortly after my husband and I moved into our first house. Children were upstairs unpacking , and I was looking out of the window at my father moving around mysteriously on the front lawn. My parents lived nearby ,and Dad had visited us several times already. ""What are you doing out there?"" I called to him .He looked up, smiling. ""I'm making you a surprise."" Knowing my father, I thought it could be just about anything. A self-employed jobber, he was always building things out of odds and ends. When we were kids, he always created something surprising for us. Today, however, Dad would say no more, and caught ups in the busyness of our new life, I eventually forgot about his surprise. Until one gloomy day the following March when I glanced out of the window. Any yet... I saw a dot of blue across the yard. I headed outside for a closer look. They were crocuses , throughout the front lawn. Lavender, blue, yellow and my favorite pink ---- little faces moved up and down in the cold wind. Dad! I smiled, remembering the things he had secretly planted last autumn. He knew how the darkness and dullness of winter always got me down. What could have been more perfectly timely to my needs? My father's crocuses bloomed each spring for the next four or five seasons, bringing the same assurance every time they arrived: hard times was almost over. Hold on, keep going, light is coming soon. Then a spring came with only half the usual blooms. The next spring there were none. I missed the crocuses. I would ask Dad to come over and plant new bulbs. But I never did. He died suddenly one October day. My family was in deep sorrow, leaning on our faith. I missed him terribly. Four years passed, and on a dismal spring afternoon I was driving back when I found myself feeling depressed. ""You've got the winter depression again and you get them every year."" I told myself. It was Dad's birthday, and I found myself thinking about him. This was not unusual --- my family often talked about him, remembering how he lived his faith. Once I saw him give his coat to a homeless man. Suddenly I slowed as I turned into our driveway. I stopped and stared at the lawn. And there on the muddy grass and small gray piles of melting snow, bravely waving in the wind, was one pink crocus. How could a flower bloom from a bulb more than 18 years old, one that had not blossomed in over a decade? But there was the crocus. Tears filled my eyes as I realized its significance. Hold on, keep going, light is coming soon. The pink crocus bloomed for only a day. But it built my faith for a lifetime."	['faith']
What did Roberta Gibb do to prepare herself for the Boston Marathon ?	"In 490 B.C. the Greek messenger, Pheidippides , ran about 40 kilometers from the town of ""Marathon""to Athens to announce the victory of Athens over Macedon . Since then ,the 42-kilometer ""Marathon""race has become a great test for athletes. However, for many years , only men were allowed to run this race , because the distance was said to be unbearable for women. In 1966, an American women named Roberta Gibb proved that idea wrong. Gibb had always enjoyed running .One day in 1964 , she saw the Boston Marathon happening as she was running in the woods. Since running meant a lot to her, she began training harder , hoping to join the marathon some day. Gibb finally applied to run in the 1966 Boston Marathon, but she was not given entrance because the Boston Marathon Association considered that women were not strong enough to run 42 kilometers . Yet, this was no obstacle to Gibb, for she knew she had the physical and mental strength to complete the race .On the day the 1966 Boston Marathon was held , Gibb hid in the bushes and jumped into the race when it began. She finished the race in 3 hours and 21 minutes, defeating two thirds of the men in the race and proving that women could run the marathon. Although what Gibb did was only to realize her dream, in doing so she showed the world that women could accomplish greater things than many people believed they could."

According to the passage, always sticking to our goals is _ .	It might sound ridiculous that goal setting could actually hold you back from completing tasks and dreams you may have. But it seems like everyone tells you should be setting goals for everything you want to accomplish, short term and long term. Goals can help you sometimes, but in some cases they just lead to constant frustration and they actually bring you down. Let's look at this a little closer with an example. A lot of people might set forth as a goal. Many people jump online and are looking to start a business online as a way to make money from home and let's say they set a goal to make $10,000 in their first month. They do this because they seem tons of people making large sums of money in very little time so they think, $10,000 a month, that shouldn't be too hard. But what happens when you only bring in $1,000 in your first 30 days online? If this is pure profit you might still be happy but this is nowhere near reaching the goal you originally set out to meet. So naturally you would feel like you failed to reach your goal and you may be a little disappointed in yourself. If you continue not to reach this goal month in month , it starts to add up and really weighs on you. I'm not saying that they are bad and you shouldn't set them but you need to realize that you should not be emotionally attached to your goals. An alternative approach would be to set certain milestones for when you want to accomplish things and start out small. Build your confidence by accomplishing smaller feats and if you overproduce, then it will be a nice surprise. You have to have some sort of end result in mind but break it down in to a day by day task. It makes it a lot easier for you to handle by just knowing everyday you have to complete a few small tasks and over time the snowball will roll into great things.	['unnecessary']
Which is the best title for the passage?	Whether in the workplace or on the football field, effective teamwork can produce amazing results.However, working successfully as a team is not as easy as it may seem.Effective teamwork certainly does not just happen automatically; it take s a great deal of hard work and compromise.There are a number of factors that must be in place to make a good team. Effective leadership is one of the most important components of good teamwork.The team's leader should possess the skills to create and preserve a positive working environment and motivate and inspire the team members to take a positive approach to work and be highly committed.An effective team leader will promote a high level of spirit and make them feel supported and valued. Communication is a vital factor of all interpersonal relationship and especially that of a team.Team member s must be able to _ their feelings, express plans and goals, share ideas and see each other's opinions. Conflicts will arise no matter how well a team functions together.The best way to deal with conflicts is to have some organized methods of handling conflicts.Team members should be able to voice their concerns without fear of offending others.Instead of avoiding conflict issues, a hands-on approach that settles them quickly is much better.It is often advised that the team leader sit with the conflicting parties and help work out their differences without taking sides and trying to remain objective if possible. The team leader must set a good example to create good teamwork.In order to keep team members positive and committed and motivated, the team leader herself / himself needs to show these qualities.The team turns to the leader for support and guidance.So any negative words or behaviors on the leader's part can be disastrous. Regardless of what type of work you are in, knowing how to effectively work on and with a team is going to be extremely important to your success and that of your team.

Which of the following will probably injure young birds?	Every year in late spring at Wild Friends, the wildlife health center, workers receive baby animals, including songbirds and rabbits. This is the busiest time when workers care for and raise all the little ones before sending them back into the wild. There are many reasons for these little animals' coming to the center. First of all, street cats or dogs catch, injure or take away little birds from their nests. Sometimes people catch baby animals and keep them at home, giving them food that they are not used to. It would make them sick. Most people don't realize that it's against law to get live animals out of their nests. As for songbirds, people often find them on the ground in their yards, thinking they have no other choice but to leave them on the ground to die. This is because many people wrongly believe that once a bird is touched by a person, its mother will not accept this child bird. But that's not true. If a little bird falls out of the nest, you should check whether it is injured. If not, you should put the bird back in the nest. If the bird is injured, call your local wildlife center quickly. As for the progress of protecting wild animals, people at Wild Friends devote all their energy to this work. Over the last weeks, they have been able to send many of the birds and rabbits that came here earlier this spring back to nature.	['Leaving them on the ground.']

From the passage we can infer that the author was _ .	I realized that I was getting cold, and felt it was probably time to go back to the apartment, so I put my collar up against the wind and began to walk back up the cold street. I managed to get some food from a vendor , and walked on. About twenty-five minutes later I knew that something was wrong. It was getting very, very cold, there were no streetlights, and the hill I was hoping to see on my right was nowhere in sight. There was almost no light except for mysterious red crosses shining from the tops of churches, and I was beginning to get worried. To cut a long story short, I had walked the wrong way from a crossroads, and had wandered miles in the wrong direction. My head was aching from the cold, and I couldn't think straight. Turing around, I started back, and a long time later was outside the house I had set off from. It was at about that time I realized that I had a gate key but no house key. How happy I was when I found that the front door was open--my only piece of good luck that day. My apartment was of course locked, my head felt like it was about to explode, and my hands and feet were freezing. I tried turning the handle. No luck. I tried another key from England. I wanted to avoid waking the family downstairs, so despite the fear of an early death from cold, I couldn't break the door down. What would my hosts think? I pulled an ATM card from my pocket and forced it alongside the inside of the lock. I didn't think it would work, but after fifteen minutes of trying, I heard a click. Another couple of minutes later the door was open. Relieved, I took off my clothes in the dark and got into bed.	['careful']
What does the Wise Owl want Sara to do?	One of the most popular items in the school newspaper is the advice column. No one knows who writes it. The students think their teacher does, but it might be a student using a false name. The students enjoy thinking up problems for the advice column. Here are some of them and their answers. Ask the Wise Owl Q: I'm always late for school. I try not to be, but I can't help it. Please advise me what to do. Tommy. A: You are probably late for school because you don't really like school. My advice to you is to try and enjoy school more, then you won't be late so often. Q: I find it difficult to make friends. What do you think I should do? Sara. A: I can't advise you until I know more about you. Your problem may be that you are shy. On the other hand, it may be the opposite. You may be too bold . Write and tell me more about yourself. Q: I'm always at the bottom(,) of the class. What do you advise me to do? Molly. A: I advise you to concentrate on improving your grades in one subject to start with. If you can do this, you should move a little way up from the bottom. Next, try to improve your grades in another subject, and so on. If you concentrate on one subject at a time, by the end of the year you should be quite a long way up from the bottom in all your classes.	['Give more information about herself.']
This passage is mainly about _ .	"We can make mistakes at any age.Some mistakes we make are about money.But most mistakes are about people.One might say, ""Did Jerry really care when I broke up with Helen?"" ""When I got that great job, did Jim really feel good about it, as a friend? Or did he envy my luck?"" When we look back, doubts like these can make us feel bad. Why do we go wrong about our friends? Sometimes what people want to say hides their real meaning.And if we don't really listen, we miss the feeling behind the words.Suppose someone tells you, ""You're a lucky dog."" Is he really on your side? If he says, ""You are a lucky guy"", that's being friendly.But if he says ""a lucky dog"", there's a bit of envy in those words.Maybe he doesn't see it himself.But he puts you down a little if he brings in the ""dog"".What he may be saying is that he doesn't think you deserve your luck. ""Just think of all the things you have to be thankful for"" is another noise that says one thing and means another.It could mean that the speaker is trying to get you to see your problem as part of your life as a whole.But is he trying to? Wrapped up in this phrase is the thought that your problem isn't important.It's telling you to think of all the starving people in the world when you haven't got a date for Saturday night. How can you tell the real meaning behind someone's words? One way is to take a good look at the person talking.Do his words fit the way he looks? Does what he says agree with the tone of voice, his posture, or the look in his eyes? Stop and think.The minute you spend thinking about the real meaning of what people say to you may save another mistake. Therefore, when you hear someone saying, please try to know what he really means.Don't just listen to what he says with your ears but feel the words he uses with your head.In this way you may make fewer mistakes."

Which of the following ideas would Dr Etienne Krug agree with?	"People should listen to music for no more than one hour a day to protect their hearing, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests. It says 1.1 billion teenagers and young adults are at risk of permanently damaging their hearing by listening to ""too much, too loudly"". It said audio devices , concerts and bars were causing a ""serious threat"". WHO figures show 43 million people aged 12-35 have hearing loss and the number is increasing. In that age group, the WHO said, half of the people in rich and middle-income countries were exposed to unsafe sound levels from personal audio devices. Meanwhile 40% were exposed to damaging levels of sound from clubs and bars. The proportion of US teenagers with hearing loss went from 3.5% in 1994 to 5.3% in 2006. ""What we're trying to do is raise awareness of the problem that is not talked about enough, but has the potential to do a lot of damage that can be easily prevented,"" said Dr Etienne Krug, the WHO's director for injury prevention. The full report argued: ""While it is important to keep the volume down, limiting the use of personal audio devices to less than one hour a day would do much to reduce noise exposure."" Dr Krug said: ""That's a rough recommendation, it is not by the minute, to give an idea to those spending 10 hours a day listening to an mp3-player. But even an hour can be too much if the volume is too loud."""	['Safe noise exposure is based on the limitation to both volume and time.']
To hold fast your dream, you should _ .	"Do you have a dream, something you always see yourself doing? Perhaps you see yourself as a lawyer, businessman, or even a scientist. Whatever it is, don't let it die. A dream is a wonderful thing. It can give your hope for your future and encourage you to try when all odds are against you. However, there are dream killers that want to kill your dream. People who don't want to see your dream fulfilled can destroy your dream. They may tell you that it is impossible for you, that you are not smart enough or that it's never been done before. However, many times the biggest dream killer is you. Don't let fear, doubt or lack of finances prevent you from fulfilling your dream. Talk back to these killers, "" I can and will fulfill my dream."" You may have to do this every day. The more you instill within your heart that you can do it, the more safely your dream will be held within you. It is very important to take steps towards fulfilling your dream. For me, in order to fulfill my dream of one-day owning my own magazine, I needed to go back to school and finish my college degree. For you, it may be something different you know deep inside what the voice of your dream calls for. Don't be afraid and just do it. Try not to let too much time go by. Time is another one of those dream killers. Think about the words of a song by Yolanda Adams, "" Keep the dream alive, don't let it die, if something deep inside keeps inspiring you to try, don't stop. And never give up, don't ever give up on you. Sometimes, life can place a stumbling block in you way. But you gotta to keep the faith. When you dream, dream big and never give up. Your dream is just yours. Never let anyone tell you that your dream can't happen--- it can! Nurture your dream. Keep seeing yourself do what's never been done before. As you continue to feed your dream and protect it, not only will you keep it alive, but it will come true."	['encourage yourself']

Where can we most probably read this passage?	"In the United States you will find yourself being urged from every page of every newspaper and every television station to buy all kinds of goods. Not only is there a wide range of prices for goods in America, there is also a wide range in the quality of goods offered for sale. Unlike some countries, Americans generally pay the price of a product without question, instead of trying to get a lower price by bargaining. However, there are many ""sales"" in the United States, during which time stores will lower their normal prices. This may all be very confusing to visitors. How are you going to know how to ""get your money's worth"" when you shop? Perhaps the best advice is: Don't hurry. Visit various stores and determine the quality of goods. Read the advertisements so that you can compare prices. There is a great variety of shops in the United States, ranging from very large stores called ""department stores"" to very small shops. There are ""discount houses"" offering goods at low prices, and ""dime stores"" specializing in a wide range of inexpensive items. Most department stores in large cities carry better quality products at higher prices. However, they offer the shoppers great convenience since they contain such a wide variety of products. If convenience isn't as important to you as price, you may want to shop in discount houses. These stores have nearly as great a variety of goods as department stores, but offer lower prices. They can do so for several reasons. They don't offer the same services to buyers that department stores do; there may be fewer sales people; and the store probably doesn't deliver purchases. Another popular shop is the ""dime store"". No longer selling many things for five or ten cents, these stores got their name in the last century when it was decided that a small profit on a great quantity of goods would be better than a large profit on fewer sales. Dime stores specialize in a wide variety of inexpensive items and today, prices range from a quarter or 50 cents up to several dollars."	['In a travel magazine.']
What made the author's customers lend her money according to the passage?	"I had my first job at a local diner called the Buttercup Bakery when I was 22. I worked there for seven years and learned so many lessons, especially from a fellow waitress Helen who had incredible self-respect and did what she loved--serving people. She made everyone smile and feel good, customers and co-workers alike. Being a waitress changed my life. One of my regular customers was Fred Hasbrook, an electronics salesman. Thanks to the newfound confidence I picked up from Helen, I dreamed of having my own restaurant. But when I called my parents to ask for a loan, they said, ""We just don't have the money."" The next day, I shared my dream with him and said, ""Fred, I know I can do more if somebody would just have faith in me."" He walked over to some of the other diner regulars and the next day handed me checks totaling $50,000--along with a note that I have to this day. It reads, ""The only collateral on this loan is my trust in your honesty as a person. Good people with a dream should have the opportunity to make that dream come true."" I took the checks to Merrill Lynch--the first time I had ever entered a brokerage house--where the money was invested for me. I continued working at the Buttercup, making plans for the restaurant I would open. My investments soured, though, and I lost the money. After great deliberation I decided to apply for a job at Merrill Lynch. Even though I had no experience, I was hired and ended up becoming a pretty good broker. Eventually I paid back Fred and my customers the $50,000, plus 14-percent annual interest. Five years later, I was able to open my own firm. I got a thank-you note from Fred, which will be imprinted on my head forever. He had been sick and wrote that my check had helped cover his mounting medical bills. His letter read, ""That loan may have been one of the best investments that I will ever make."""	['Her honesty.']
What's the weather in Ken Libbrecht's hometown usually like?	"Snowflakes! You can catch them on your tongue or use them to make a perfect snowball. But have you ever thought about taking pictures of them? Ken Libbrecht did. He is a physics professor from California. Although the weather in California is usually warm and sunny, Ken's hobby is taking pictures of snowflakes. He travels to cold areas like Alaska and Canada to find snowstorms and take pictures of the snowflakes. ""They are often beautiful, and every snowfall brings new surprises,"" says Ken. Ken takes pictures of snowflakes with a high-quality digital camera. He uses a microscope to make the tiny snowflakes larger. To get the best images, Ken built a special photo-microscope just for snowflakes. He collects flakes by letting them fall onto a piece of foam board . The pictures must be taken outdoors, so Ken wears lots of clothes to stay warm. But his fingers often get cold, because it's difficult for him to take pictures of a tiny snowflake with gloves. Each snowflake has shapes and patterns that make it as unique as a person's fingerprint. The hobby of snowflake photography is also unique. Next time a snowstorm blows through your town, take a closer look at the flakes before you gather them into a snowball. See if you can notice their unique patterns.

What would be the best title for the text?	"One evening last summer, when I asked my 17-year-old son, Ray, for help with dinner, his response surprised me, ""What's a colander ?"" he asked. I could only blame myself. Nobody's hands went in the sauce except my own. But that night, as I explained with a touch of panic that a colander is the thing with holes in it, I wondered what else I hadn't prepared Ray for. As parents, while we focus on our child's confidence and character, we perhaps don't always consider that we are also raising someone's future roommate, boyfriend, husband, or father. I wanted to know that I'd raised a boy who would never ask the woman in his life, ""What's for dinner?"" So I came up with a plan: I would offer Ray a private home economics course. I was delighted to find that he didn't say no. For two hours, three days a week, Ray was all mine. One day, as his tomato sauce reduced on the stove, he washed and seasoned a chicken for roasting. Then he rolled out the piecrust and filled it with apples, all while listening to my explanation on the importance of preheating an oven. I knew that he would rather have been shooting hoops I the driveway than learning to mend socks with his mother -- he tried to beg off sewing lessons, even though I insisted that one day, someone would find the sight of him fixing his own shirt very attractive -- but it couldn't be denied that he was learning, and _ . ""I appreciate more what you do as a mom,"" he told me one day. Ray now understands the finer points of cooking, and more important, he realizes there's nothing masculine about being helpless. Not only can he make his own dinner, he can make it for his family, too. That's what I call a man."	['Present for my future daughter-in-law.']

Which of the following can be the best title for this passage?	"Bad days happen to us all. Often a day that starts out bad just continues to get worse. Sometimes there's a ""domino effect "" with bad events. For example, you sleep through the alarm, so you're stressed. And you will sit in the bad traffic, which will also make you late for work, etc. How can we turn a bad day to a good day? Here are some ideas that have worked for me: Smile a lot Smiling a lot will help you feel relaxed. Research has shown that smiling produces three useful chemicals which make us feel good. Talk to a good friend Keeping bad or unhappy things in your mind is not a good idea. Talking to someone who cares and listen really does help us feel better, too. Concentrate on your good things It's hard to concentrate on how bad things are when you're concentrating on how good things are! Think of 10 or more things you're thankful for, and you'll achieve a whole new outlook on your day. Get some exercise If you can, go for a walk. Exercising will help you feel better. Excising can get your day back to be normal again. Make the day a challenge If you make yourself think of the day as a challenge, you'll start to do all the things you can to make your day better. ,."	['How to deal with problems']
According to the passage, Charlotte Green lost control on the programme because _ .[ ]	"When was the last time you laughed a lot? Most people are the victim of an uncontrollable fit of laughter at least once in their lives. But when it happens in front of the television cameras, it can become an internet sensation. Do you think there's anything funny about spicy meat? Swiss finance minister Hans-Rudolf Merz seemed to think it was hilarious. Mr. Merz was making a speech in the Swiss parliament on meat imports when he started laughing and couldn't stop. The meat in question is known as ""bundnerfleisch""-- a type of air-dried beef product. Herr Merz later admitted that he was amused by the bureaucratic language in which the bill was written. Since then, Mr. Merz has become an internet hit. A video of the incident shows a grey-suited minister giggling away, accompanied by applause from his parliamentary colleagues. So far, the video has been seen by more than 500,000 people on YouYube and other websites. ""I don't understand what he's talking about,"" said one viewer, ""but it's just so funny."" The recent publicity will be good news for the minister, too. Mr. Merz had been criticized recently for signing away much of Switzerland's banking secrecy, and for failing to do enough to help two Swiss citizens who were detained by Libya. But now, with retirement a few months away, Mr. Merz may leave on a high note. Some even suggest he may have a future career as a comedian. Of course, Mr. Merz isn't the first person to _ on air. BBC Radio 4 newsreader Charlotte Green lost control on the programmeTodaynot so long ago. It all happened after a clip of the oldest known recording of the human voice was played. A studio member remarked that the 1860 recording of a woman singing the French song ""Au Clair de la Lune"" sounded like a ""bee buzzing in a bottle"". That seemed to set Ms. Green off as she broke down into a fit of the giggles. Later, the editor of the show, Ceri Thomas, said most listeners who contacted the show had commented on ""how much they had enjoyed the moment"". He added, ""When Charlotte loses it, she really loses it."" So, why do we get these fits of laughter? Experts say it's a form of release. Nervous tension often builds up inside us, especially in those who have got high-pressure, stressful jobs. When stressed out, the body constricts blood vessels, elevates the production of potentially damaging stress hormones, and raises blood pressure. Short periods of stress are normal and not dangerous, but over long periods of time stress weakens the immune system and makes heart problems more likely. Under the control ofself-protecting mechanisms of human body, this pressure needs an outlet, usually manifesting itself through tears, anger or laughter-- uncontrollable fits of laughter! So, beware! That uncontrollable laughing fit could strike at any moment. [(<<>> 201102 ""Laugh Away"")]"	['the recording of the French song sounded extremely funny.']
In Singapore when someone died, people there usually _ .	While all cultures share the same basic emotions, the body language used throughout different cultures of the world vary enormously. What can mean one thing in one country can often mean something completely different in another. For example, in North America and Europe people tend to prefer direct eye contact. But in some Asian countries longer eye contact is considered rude. So when communicating with people, always be aware of different cultural customs that may exist. A V sign in the US could mean victory, but in England, it stands for a rude challenge, which has the same meaning as showing the middle finger in the US. The OK gesture in America and England is given to mean everything is good or well. But in Latin America is looked on as a rude sign. The thumbs up sign in America and most of Europe means that something is good or well done, but it is considered rude in many Asian countries. Putting your feet on the table is generally not thought to be rude in America and England. However, in Thailand it is really rude. Telling someone to come to you by curling your index finger is acceptable in America and England, but this gesture signifies death in Singapore. Raising your hand up means stop in America and England. In some Asian countries this gesture is used when asking for permission to speak. In most westernized countries it is considered normal for two men to shake hands. In some Asian countries it is quite normal for men to kiss each other, while in most westernized countries men kissing in public would be viewed as homosexual behavior.

We can find night markets	Most cities and towns in China have night markets . During the day, these streets are quiet. At night, they become crowded and lively. Usually, people get there at three or four in the afternoon. By 6:00, the streets are like rivers of people. Night markets are fun places to shop. You can buy clothes, shoes, and many other things. If you think the price is too high, you can _ with the seller. You can also buy nice food. When you are hungry, you can Sit down for a meal. Smelly tofu is popular, but it really smells bad! The best thing is that everything in night markets is cheap!	['in most cities and towns']
At the end of the passage above, Mr. Jaggers says he also has money to give Joe because _ .	The months and years went by. I had been Joe's _ for four years. One evening, Joe and I were sitting in the village inn. A stranger came in, a big, tall man, with heavy eyebrows. The man had large, very clean white hands. To my surprise, I recognized the man. I had seen him at Miss Havisham's many years before. He had frightened me then. He frightened me a little now. 'I think there is a blacksmith here----name of Joe Gargery,' the man said in his loud voice. 'That's me!' Joe answered. He stood up. 'You have an apprentice, known as Pip,' the stranger went on. 'Where is he? ' 'Here!' I cried, standing beside Joe. 'I wish to speak to you both. I wish to speak to you privately, not here,' the man said. 'Perhaps I could go home with you.' We walked back to the workshop in silence. When we were in the sitting room, the man began to speak. 'My name is Jaggers,' he said. 'I am a lawyer in London, where I am well-known. I have some unusual business with young Pip here. I am speaking for someone else, you understand. A client who doesn't want to be named. Is that clear?' Joe and I nodded. 'I have come to take your apprentice to London,' the lawyer said to Joe. 'You won't stop him from coming I hope?' 'Stop him? Never! ' Joe cried. 'Listen, then. I have this message for Pip. He has ---- great expectations!' Joe and I looked at each other, too surprised to speak. 'Yes, great expectations' Mr. Jaggers repeated. 'Pip will one day be rich, very rich. Pip is to change his way of life at once. He will no longer be a blacksmith. He is to come with me to London. He is to be educated as a gentleman. He will be a man of property.' And so, at last, my dream had come true. Miss Havisham----because Mr. Jaggers' client must be Miss Havisham----had plans for me after all. I would be rich and Estella would love me! Mr. Jaggers was speaking again. 'There are two conditions,' he said, looking at me. 'First, you will always be known as Pip. Secondly,' Mr. Jaggers continued, 'the name of your benefactor is to be kept secret. One day, that person will speak to you, face to face. Until then, you must not ask any questions. You must never try to find out this person's name. Do you understand? Speak out!' 'Yes, I understand,' I answered. 'My benefactor's name is to remain a secret.' 'Good,' Mr. Jaggers said. 'Now, Pip, you will come into your property when you come of age----when you are twenty-one. Until then, I am your guardian. I have money to pay for your education and to allow you to live as a gentleman. You will have a private teacher. His name is Mr. Matthew Pocket and you will stay at his house.' I gave a cry of surprise. Some of Miss Havisham's relations were called Pocket. Mr. Jaggers raised his eyebrows. 'Do you not want to live with Mr. Pocket? Have you any objection to this arrangement?' he said severely. 'No, no, none at all,' I answered quickly. 'Good. Then I will arrange everything,' Mr. Jaggers went on. 'Mr. Pocket's son has rooms in London. I suggest you go there. Now when can you come to London?' I looked at Joe. 'At once, if Joe has no objection,' I said. 'No objection, Pip old chap,' Joe answered. 'Then you will come in one week's time,' Mr. Jaggers said, standing up. 'You will need new clothes. Here is some money to pay for them. Twenty guineas.' He counted the money and put it on the table. 'Well, Joe Gargery, you are saying nothing,' Mr. Jaggers said to Joe firmly. 'I have money to give to you too.'	['Joe will have to hire a new worker']
What did Jay Carney's words imply?	"The NSA and GCHQ are tapping popular smart phone apps such as Angry Birds to gather the enormous amounts of very personal data those bits of software collect--including age, gender, marital status, income, education level and more, according to new reports from the New York Times and The Guardian. Citing secret documents provided by Edward Snowden, former NSA staff, the reports detail efforts to gain data collection from cell phone carriers and smart phones by tapping into ""leaky"" apps themselves. Both spy agencies showed a particular interest in Google Maps, which is accurate to within a few yards or better in some locations and would clearly pass along data about the area where phone owner is. ""It effectively means that anyone using Google Maps on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system,"" reads a secret 2008 report by the NSA's sister spy agency, according to the New York Times. More surprising is the wide range of apps that the agencies search for data, including innocent-seeming apps such as Angry Birds. One document in particular from GCHQ listed what information can be found from which apps, mentioning Android apps but suggesting the same data was available from the iPhone platform. Angry Birds maker Rovio Entertainment of Finland said it had no knowledge of any NSA or GCHQ programs for tapping into its users' data. ""Rovio doesn't have any previous knowledge of this matter, and have not been aware of such activity in 3rd party advertising networks,"" said Saara Bergstrom. ""Nor do we have any involvement with the organizations you mentioned."" Mobile photos uploaded to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter appear to be a particularly rich source of information for the spy agencies as well. Metadata in the photos is briefly available. The NSA and GCHQ are able to tap into that metadata to collect a wealth of key data points about a person's life. ""NSA does not profile everyday Americans as it carries out its foreign intelligence mission,"" the agency told the Times in response to questions about the program. During a Monday press conference, White House press secretary Jay Carney stressed that same position. ""As the president said in his Jan. 17 speech, to the extent data is collected by the NSA, through whatever means, we are not interested in the communications of people who are not valid foreign intelligence targets and we are not after the information of ordinary Americans,"" he said."

The best title for this article is _ .	In England recently three foreign gentlemen came to a bus stop and waited. About five minutes later, the bus they wanted came along. They were just going to get on when suddenly there was a loud noise behind them. People rushed onto the bus and tried to push them out of the way. Someone shouted at them. The bus conductor came rushing down the stairs to see what all the trouble was about. The three foreigners seem all at sea and looked embarrassed . No one had told them about the British custom of lining up for a bus that the first person who arrives at the bus stop is the first person to get on the bus . Learning the language of a country isn't enough. If you want to have a pleasant visit, find out as much as possible about the manners and customs of your host country. You will probably be surprised just how different they can be from your own. A visitor to India would do well to remember that people there consider it impolite to use the left hand for passing food at table. The left hand is supposed to be used for washing yourself. Also in India, you might see a man shaking his head at another to show that he doesn't agree. But in many parts of India a shake of the head means agreement. Nodding your head when you are given a drink in Bulgaria will most probably leave you thirsty. In that country, you shake your head to mean 'yes'-- a nod means 'no'. At a meal in countries on the Arabic Peninsula, you will find that your glass is repeated refilled as soon as you drink up. If you think that you have had enough, you should take the cup or glasses in your hand and give it a little shake from side to side or place your hand over the top. In Europe it's quite usual to cross your legs when you are sitting talking to someone even at an important meeting. Doing this in Thailand, however, could bring about trouble. Also, you should try to avoid touching the head of an adult ----it's just not done in Thailand .	['Mind Your Manners']
From this passage we know that _ .	Students in many countries are learning English. Some of these students are small children. Others are teen-agers. Many are adults. Some learn at school, others by themselves. A few learn English by learning the language over the radio, on TV, or in film. One must work hard to learn another language. Why do all these people want to learn English? It is difficult to answer this question. Many boys and girls learn English at school because it is one of their subjects required for study. They study their own language and maths and English: Some people learn it because it is useful for their work. Many people learn English for their work. Many people learn English for their higher studies, because at college or university some of their books are in English. Other people learn English because they want to read newspapers or magazines in English.	['English is a useful language but one must work hard to learn']
"What's the meaning of the sentence ""the rat race is on if you are a rat""?"	"I entered college in China in 1981. Many things seemed to remain the same. For many things are dominated by one thing: the national entrance examination to get into college. In my year, about 4% high school students went to college. Now the number is 22%, as compared to 40% in the US. The significant increase in the entrance rate doesn't seem to have relieved the anxiety. As a parent to a freshman college student, I can prove that junior and senior years in high school are not much fun even for students in the US. Once a country has vastly increased the rate of college entrance, students will still want to get into ""better"" colleges. _ , no matter where you are. The NYT Magazine article also mentioned the Soviet-style over-specialized education in Chinese colleges. My class in college had maybe 60 students specialized in compressors, another 60 students specialized in refrigeration, and yet another 60 students specialized in welding . I was among the 60 specialized in mechanics. I cannot recall the numbers exactly, but you get the picture. It really wasn't as terrible as it sounds. In order to specialize in mechanics, we had to study math, physics and chemistry. We studied electrical circuits, alloy treatment, mechanical drawing, Fortran. We even had a continuous stream of humanity courses: history of communist party, political economics... I'm not sure I enjoyed all the courses, but I cannot claim that these courses damaged my brain, either. I remember some of the humanity courses required writing, which turned out to be a useful skill. As a consequence of specialization, we did learn a lot of mechanics. By the end of college, we had courses on analytical mechanics, strength of materials. I often feel sorry for American students in my undergraduate class, knowing that strength of materials will be their first and last course in the mechanics of materials. So many beautiful sights unseen! But they also seem to turn out to be OK. A liberal and superficial eduction doesn't damage their brains, either. All this high level debate about education makes me dizzy, and turns me off. So far as I can tell, both systems of eduction work fine, and have their own limitations. The bottom line is that the quantity of knowledge is too large to be crammed into 4 years, and you'd have to make choices, making it either narrow or shallow or perhaps both. You'll just have to be prepared to engage yourself in life-long learning."	['You cannot avoid competition as long as you are in the society.']
Which of the following can best describe the family?	"For years, my family has vacationed in the same Florida town. In fact, we just returned home after spending a week of spring break there with our three sons. Many nights, we take the same scenic drive to dinner at a favorite restaurant. As we travel along Gulf Shore Boulevard, we admire a combination of small beach apartments, swanky high-rises and spectacular homes. A few years ago, we noticed that whenever we drive this particular route, there are always two men sitting in front of the same third-floor window of a low-rise apartment building that overlooks the road. All that is visible from the road are their two silhouettes. Even during off-peak months, they've always been there. Over the years, we've had great fun speculating about who they are, whether they're having a drink, and if so, what they fancy, where they're from, and what they might be discussing. Our guesses have become a modern form of car bingo. Widowers? Retirees? Partners? We've run through the gamut of possibilities.[:ZXXK] Eventually, I started beeping the horn as we passed. We'd wave. Our new friends would do likewise. There was something comforting in seeing them. In a world of constant change, it has been nice to look up and see that they are there, just as we remember from our last visit. And then last spring, we drove by and they were missing. The apartment was dark. No one was visible in the window. Strangely, we drove by and they were missing The apartment was dark. No one was visible in the window. Strangely, we grew worried about two people we'd never even met. Where did they go? A new round of the guessing game began. On our last trip at Christmastime, we were relieved to see them once again. We were driving past about 6 p.m., and there they were at cocktail hour. I told my wife that I suspected they were gin drinkers and said we should buy them a bottle. She said that if I bought it, she'd deliver it. I said, ""Tomorrow."""	['friendly and hurnorous']
Which of the following is not true?	"A very new, young officer was at a station.

At last an old soldier came by, and the young officer stopped him and said, ""Have you got change for ten pence ?"" ""Wait a moment, "" the old soldier answered. He began to put his hand in his pocket, ""I'll see whether I can help you. "" ""Don't you know how to speak to an officer?"" the young man said angrily. ""Now let's start again.

Which of the following statements is true, according to the passage?	"A 70-year study of personality suggests that pessimism is a risk factor for early death, especially among men. The study results also indicate that pessimism can be linked to increased risk for sudden death from accidents or violence, according to the report published in the March issue ofPsychological Science. Christopher Peterson of the University of Michigan and his colleagues analyzed data from the Terman Life-Cycle Study, which began by studying California public-school children with high IQs in 1921 and followed them through their life. Most of the 1,528 children were teenagers when the study began. Those still living are now in their 80s. In 1936 and 1940, participants were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to obtain information about difficult life events and their effect on overall outlook. One such question was, ""What do you regard as your most serious fault of personality or character?"" Pessimists were defined as fatalistic people who tend to blame themselves when things go wrong and who believe that one bad event can ruin the rest of their life. They also tend to expect bad things to happen to them and feel that they have little or no ability to change their situation. Males were more likely than females to be classified as pessimistic. Compared with individuals with a more cheerful and optimistic outlook, pessimists were more likely to die from accidents and violence (including suicide). A pessimistic personality may lead to poor problem-solving ability, social difficulties and risky decision-making. Taken together, these variables put the pessimist at higher risk of untimely death, say the researchers. Such a person is less likely to avoid or escape potentially dangerous situations, the researchers concluded. ""A pessimistic way of thinking in which people worry too much about bad events, predicts untimely death decades later,"" according to Peterson."

What Xiao Hang said indicates _ .	"XI'AN - China has introduced various emergency responses and long-term measures against air pollution in the central and eastern regions. The air quality index (AQI) for Xi'an reached 500 on Wednesday afternoon, at the top of the AQI scale, according to the national air quality monitoring website. Xi'an weather forecasters predict the smog will continue for the next week and air pollution may worsen. ""I have to keep buying masks for my family,"" said Liu, buying masks at a pharmacy near her home in downtown Xi'an. ""This is the only thing we can do to protect ourselves."" On Wednesday, a city government emergency response plan was put into action, _ all construction and taking at least 50 percent of government vehicles off the road. Power plants must limit their output and reduce emissions. Nearly half the country, more than 100 cities in 20 provinces, has suffered from smog since last December. Many have taken action, including experimenting with artificial methods to reduce smog, limiting vehicle use and fining polluters. Assessments based on GDP alone were abandoned last month and more emphasis has been put on public well-being and the environment. Whether the move will be effective in forcing local governments consider environmental issues over economic growth remains to be seen. Environmental protection professionals are doubtful about the immediacy of the effects of these measures. Xiao Hang, an urban researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said it took London 50 years to lose the moniker ""foggy London town"", and Los Angeles still struggles to control its photochemical smog. ""We can't ignore environmental problems during the development process and China has a long way to go,"" he said."	['solving environmental problems requires great effort']
Obama's mother, Ann, died of cancer in about _ while his father died in _ .	"Throughout his early years, Obama was known at home and at school as ""Barry"". Obama's parents met while both were attending the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was enrolled as a foreign student. They separated when he was two years old and later divorced . His father received Master's degree in Economics from Harvard University, then returned to Kenya, where he became a finance minister before dying in an automobile accident in 1982. His mother married another foreign student, Lolo Soetoro, and the family moved to Soetoro's home country of Indonesia in 1967. Obama attended local schools in Jakarta, from age 6 to 10, where classes were taught in the Indonesian language. During his time in Indonesia, he first attended St. Francis Assist Catholic school for almost three years. When Obama was in third grade he wrote an essay saying that he wanted to be president. His teacher later said that his reason for becoming president was that he wanted to make everybody happy. Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his materal grandparents while attending Punahou School, a private college elementary school, from the fifth grade until his graduation in 1979. Obama's mother, Ann, died of cancer a few months after the publication of his 1995 memoir , Dreams from My Father. In the memoir, Obama describes his experiences growing up in his mother's middle class family. Of his early childhood, Obama writes, ""That my father looked nothing like the people around me---that he was black as pitch , my mother white as milk ."" Some of his fellow students at Punahou School later told the Honolulu Star--Bulletin that Obama was mature for his age as a high school student and that he sometimes attended parties and other events in order to connect with African American college students and military service people."

According to Lorraine Lanningham-Foster, _ .	"What would you think if you went back to school on Monday and there were no desks or chairs in your classroom? That's what some fourth-and-fifth-graders at a school in Minnesota discovered earlier this year when they took part in a research project to see if changing their classrooms would make them more active. Researchers from the Mayo Clinic were concerned about reports that as many as half of American kids could be seriously overweight - or obese - by the year 2014. So they set up a different kind of classroom, which you might see in the future. Instead of desks, the Elton Hills Elementary students had adjustable work stations where they could stand, kneel on mats or sit on big exercise balls. Students were given laptops and iPods that allowed them to move and learn at the same time. Sensors were attached to the kids' legs to calculate how many calories students burned in their new set-up. Their typical school day was probably not anything like yours. One group of students downloaded an audio file of their teacher reading a book; they listened to it while walking for exercise. Another group took a spelling test by listening to their iPods. Some students liked the freedom, but others missed the traditional classroom. ""I don't like standing up,"" Mariah Matrious said. ""My legs get tired, and I like sitting down. "" So, did the experiment work? Researchers still are studying the data, but early results indicate that the kids did move around more in the new classroom. ""It showed us that, given the opportunity to move, kids will move,"" said researcher Lorraine Lanningham-Foster. That's important because studies have shown that even simple movement - climbing stairs instead of taking an elevator , for example, or washing dishes by hand instead of loading the dishwasher - can be as important as formal exercise when it comes to controlling one's weight."

The letter was written to _ .	Dear Mr. Plant, I am an enthusiastic camper and longtime X-Ports customer, but after being offended for the third time at your Sierra Vista location, I am writing to complain about your impolite employees. Several months ago ,I bought a tent that leaked the first time I used it and wanted it replaced . When I took it back, your employees accused me of tearing it myself. I left not only withm1, torn tent, but no refund and no satisfaction. A couple of weeks ago , I bought a sleeping bag that was supposed to sleep two people comfort-ably. It didn't. Your employees refused to give me my money back even though I had the receipt. I was asked to leave the store, again with no satisfaction. To my misfortune, my latest purchase , of a piece of camping equipment at your store proyed to be another disappointment. The propane camp stove I bought didn't work properly. When I returned to exchange it, the rude clerk refused to help me because I did not have my sales receipt. It was an even exchange! He said that I was a problem and even asked if I had seen what products I-could purchase at one of your competitor's stores at comparable prices. Was he accusing me of something? Why would I have brought a receipt for an even exchange? Why would I know the price at other stores? Furthermore, the clerk called security and forced me to leave your store-without my camp stove! How can I go camping now? The tent leaks, the sleeping bag is just wrong, and I don't have a stove to keep warm ! Who is going to refund my money for my stove? Who is going to help me get over the abuse I suffered in your store? You, as the area manager must clear these matters up for me immediately!

What's mainly talked about in the passage?	First direct coal liquefaction line produces (Xinhua) HOHHOT - China's first direct coal-to-oil project, operated by the country's leading coal producer, Shenhua Group, produced 866,000 tons of oil products last year. The direct coal liquefaction line is located in Ejin Horo Banner , Ordos city, North China's Inner Mongolia autonomous region. It produces 3,000 tons of oil products by using nearly 10,000 tons of coal per day, said Shenhua Coal Liquefaction and Chemical Co.,Ltd. With an investment of 12.6 billion yuan ($2.06 billion), Shenhua Group began construction of the project in 2004, using self-developed technologies. The project began trial production at the end of 2009 with a designed annual capacity of 1.08 million tons of diesel , naphtha and liquefied petroleum gas . Proven coal reserves around Ordos are estimated at 160 billion tons, or 11.4 percent of the country's total coal reserves. As part of its clean energy strategy, China has begun a number of direct or indirect coal liquefaction and coal gasification projects in Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Xinjiang and Liaoning in the past three years.

What can we infer from the passage? _	The _ film Titanic has brought millions of dollars and thousands of people to the theaters and continues to touch people today in their homes. Why is this film so successful? It is a combination of many different things. Among these are many different elements. Looking at some of these elements will show how the director and others involved were able to create an emotionally charged movie that appealed to millions. The film uses one thematic element called - The Truth of Human Nature. The two main characters seem to represent noble people. Most of the other characters in the film are shown as non-tolerant, rude and cold-hearted people. The element of focusing on the two main characters' love and emotion seems symbolic of an ideal state. There are also social problems addressed. This is done in a few different ways. The most noticeable way is that the lower class people remain locked in the basement as the ship goes down. Throughout Titanic, the lighting is very important. The poor, lower class people are always shown in very warm-coloured light that gives them a sense of life and happiness. On the other hand, the rich, upper class are always shown in a flat light portraying the feeling of hardness and coldness. By using these techniques, they show the issue of class segregation , and they create stereotypes. The main characters are able to break free of these stereotypes and be together. This is the solution to the segregation problem. As you can see, Titanic took a lot of thinking and preparation to film in a manner that would create emotion and bring to the surface the issues and story of the great ship.	['Though love is the main theme of Titanic, it also reflects some social problems.']
People feel tired after yoga because _ .	"Babies are born yogis. Once we were all able to pull our toes up by our ears and laugh about it. Then we aged, got injured, and began carrying stress in our shoulders and back. In short, we lost our balance. Yoga is an ancient practice that helps create a sense of union in body, mind, and spirit. It brings us balance. I was seriously out of balance when I started practicing yoga in 1999. I had plantar facilities in both feet, and my doctor had warned me against all the things I loved to do: walking, hiking, and playing tennis. I was desperate for exercise. Yoga became my salvation and even enhanced my other fitness activities. I practice yoga at least twice a week, but I consider yoga to be part of my daily life because after a while you no longer just practice yoga--you love it. Yoga becomes part of your physical life. Your body grows stronger, more toned, and more flexible as you move from one pose to the other. I spent a week in Mexico at a yoga retreat, and it was the first vacation on which I lost weight. ""Rather than building muscle, yoga builds muscle tone,"" says Shakta Kaur Khalsa, author of the K.I.S.S. Guide to Yoga. ""Because yoga helps maintain a balanced metabolism , it also helps to regulate weight. Additionally, yoga stretches muscles lengthwise, causing fat to be removed around the cells."" I do yoga poses throughout the day. After hours at my computer, I stretch my stiff shoulders and arms. When I need a boost of energy, I do energizing poses. When I am feeling exhausted at the end of the day, I do restorative poses. Yoga becomes part of your mental life. Yoga teaches you to focus on breathing while you hold the poses. This attention to breath is calming; it dissolves stress and anxiety. I use yogic breathing on the tennis courts, in the dentist's chair, and in traffic jams. You should always leave a yoga practice feeling energized, not tired. If you feel tired after yoga, it means you spent the time ""fighting"" yourself, trying to force yourself into poses. In yoga, you ""surrender"" to the pose by letting go of the tension. Yoga becomes part of your spiritual life. Yoga is practiced by people from all religions; it is not restricted to any religious group. Yoga teaches ""right"" living in how we deal with ourselves and others. As I work on a difficult pose, I learn patience, forgiveness, and the value of gentleness. Yoga advocates proper eating, but you don't have to be a vegetarian to practice yoga."

All of the following are true EXCEPT that _ .	Most people feel lonely sometimes, but it usually only lasts a few minutes or a few hours. This kind of loneliness is not serious. In fact, it is quite normal. For some people, though, loneliness can last for years. Now researchers say there are three different types of loneliness. The first kind of loneliness is temporary. This is the most common type. It usually disappears quickly and does not require any special attention. The second kind, situational loneliness, is a natural result of a particular situation-for example, the death of a loved one, or moving to a new place. Although this kind of loneliness can cause physical problems, such as headaches and sleeplessness, it usually does not last for more than a year. Situational loneliness Is easy to understand and to predict. The third kind of loneliness is the most severe. Unlike the second type, loneliness usually lasts more than two years and has no specific cause. People who experience habitual loneliness have problem socializing and becoming close to others unfortunately, many chronically lonely people think there is little or nothing they can do to improve their condition. Many researchers agree that the loneliest people are between the ages 18 and 25, so a group of psychologists decided to study a group of college students. They found that more than 50% of the students were situationally lonely at the beginning of the term as a result of their new circumstances, but had adjusted after a few months, 13% were still lonely after seven months due to shyness and fear. They felt very uncomfortable meeting strangers, even though they understood that their fear was not reasonable. The situationally lonely students overcame their loneliness by making new friends, but the chronically lonely remained unhappy because they were afraid to do so. Psychologists are trying to find ways to help habitually lonely people for two reasons: First of all, they are unhappy and unable to socialize and there is a connection between chronic loneliness and serious illness such as heart disease. While temporary and situational loneliness can be a normal, healthy part of life, chronic loneliness can be a very sad, and sometimes dangerous condition.

It seems likely from the passage that the baby's illness had something to do with _ .	"In 1977, a dead author of detective stories saved the life of a 19-month-old baby in a most unusual way. The author was Agatha Christie, one of the most successful writers of detective stories in the world. In June 1977, a baby girl became seriously ill in Qatar, near Saudi Arabia. Doctors were unable to find out the cause of her illness with confidence, so she was sent to Hammersmith Hospital in London. She was then only semi-conscious and on the ""Dangerously Ill"" list. A team of doctors hurried to examine the baby only to discover that they, too, were confused by the very unusual symptoms . While they were discussing the baby's case, a nurse asked to speak to them. ""Excuse me,"" said Nurse Marsha Maitlan, ""but I think the baby is suffering from thallium poisoning."" ""What makes you think that?"" Dr. Brown asked. ""Thallium poisoning is extremely rare."" ""A few days ago, I was reading a novel called A Pale Horse by Agatha Christie,"" Nurse Maitlan explained. ""In the book, somebody uses thallium poison, and all the symptoms are described. They're exactly the same as the baby's."" ""You're very thoughtful and you may be right,"" another doctor said. ""We'll carry out some tests and find out whether it's thallium or not."" Tests showed that the baby had indeed been poisoned by thallium, a rare metallic substance used in making special glass. Once they knew the cause of the illness, the doctors were able to give the baby the correct treatment. She soon recovered and was sent back to Qatar. Later it was reported that the poison might have come from an insecticide used in Qatar."	['a harmful substance used to kill insects']
What can we learn from the passage?	Scene 1 On a wild mountain, two goats met on a rock just over a high cliff . The rock was so narrow that there was neither room for them to pass each other nor to turn round and go back. One of them with great care laid himself down on the narrow rock, pressing as close to the rock as he could. Then the other goat gently and softly stepped over his friend, till, safely past him, he could lightly get away. The goat that had lain down then drew himself up, safe and free to leap again from rock to rock, and eat the sweet grass on the hills. Scene 2 Two other goats met on the banks of a wild, rushing stream. They found there was a tree across the stream. It formed a bridge from one side to the other. They stood for a moment with one foot on the tree, each thinking that the other would draw back. But neither of them would give away, and they met at last on the middle of the narrow bridge! They then began to push and fight with their horns , till at last their feet slipped, and both the goats fell into the stream, and were lost in the waters! Both might have been saved if either of them had known how to give way to another at the right time.	['Being kind to someone is never a waste.']
It can be learned from the text that to extend an olive branch _	"The term ""to extend an olive branch"" means to make an offer of peace or reconciliation . This term has Biblical origins, coming from the section of the Old Testament that deals with the flood; the sign that the flood is over is an olive branch brought back to the ark by a dove. Olive branches were also symbols of peace in Ancient Greece and Rome, and they continue to be used in various works of art that are meant to suggest peace. Some people have suggested that the olive was a very deliberate and well-considered choice as a metaphor for peace, because olive trees famously take years to mature. War is typically very, hard on the trees because people cannot take the time to nurture them and plant new ones. Therefore, the offer of an olive branch would suggest that someone is tired of war, whether it be an actual war or a falling out between friends. In Ancient Greek and Roman times, people would offer actual olive branches. In Rome, for example, defeated armies traditionally carried olive branches to indicate that they were giving in, and the Greeks used them into weddings and other ceremonies. In the modem era, the branch is usually metaphorical, rather than actual, not least because the plants can be a bit difficult to obtain. Many people agree that peace negotiations at all levels of society are a good idea. Between nations, obviously, it is important to extend an olive branch to ensure mutual safety and to help the world run more smoothly. This act can also be important on a personal level, as resolving conflict and learning to get along with others is viewed as an important life skill in many cultures. At some point m their lives, many people will be advised to extend an olive branch to settle a dispute or resolve an issue. Some people believe that it takes an immense amount of courage to take this action, as it often comes with an admission of wrongdoing and regret."	['takes a lot of courage.']
Which of the following doesn't have much to do with a woman's beauty?	"With a PS4 million ITV contract in her pocket and an engagement to her England footballer boyfriend, it's been a good year for Christine Bleakley.Perhaps it's no wonder, as the TV presenter is 31, the age at which women are the most attractive, according to a survey. While the average British woman of 31 may be married with a child, the survey noted they are at a wonderful age because they have not only youthful beauty but also more confidence and a better sense of style than flesh-faced teenagers. Some 70 percent of more than 2,000 men and women surveyed considered confidence as a key factor in making a woman attractive, ahead of the 67 percent who included physical beauty and 47 percent who looked for a sense of style.Almost two thirds of the women agreed with the opinion ""With age, comes beauty"", and over half said that as they age they do away with their insecurities and feel more beautiful, while 55 percent felt they knew the best make-up to wear. Self-confidence varied widely across the country in the survey: London women emerged as the most confident about their looks, with 37 percent describing themselves as beautiful, compared with just 28 percent of Welsh women.Meanwhile, East Midlands women spend the most on beauty programs --PS129.69 monthly--compared with a national average of PS105.50. The research was carried on for TV shopping channel QVC to mark the launch of its ""Beauty Month"".QVC marketing director Sue Leeson said: ""This research shows what many have always suspected -- real beauty is about more than just good looks but a combination of confidence, style and personality, too."""

They never go shopping together because _ .	"My husband is a born shopper. He loves to look at things and to touch them. He likes to compare prices between the same items in different shops. He would never think of buying anything without looking around in several different shops. On the other hand, I'm not a shopper. I think shopping is boring and unpleasant. If I like something and I have enough money to take it, I buy it at once. I never look around for a good price or a better deal. Of course my husband and I never go shopping together. Doing shopping together would be too painful for both of us. When it comes to shopping, we go our different ways. Sometimes I ask my son Jimmy to buy some food in the shop not far from our home. But he is always absent-minded. This was his story. One day I said to him, "" I hope you won't forget what I have told you to buy."" "" No,"" said Jimmy. ""I won't forget. You want three oranges , six eggs and a pound of meat."" He went running down the street to the shop. As he ran, he said to himself over and over again, ""three oranges , six eggs and a pound of meat."" In the beginning he remembered everything but he stopped several times. Once he saw two men fighting outside a clothes shop until a policeman stopped them. One of them was badly hurt. Then he stopped to give ten cents to a beggar. Then he met some of his friends and he played with them for a while. When he reached the shop, he had forgotten everything except six eggs. As he walked home, his face became sadder and sadder. When he saw me he said, ""I'm sorry, Mum. I have forgotten to buy oranges and the meat. I only remembered to buy six eggs, but I've dropped three of them."""

Which of the following is TRUE?	We all know that food makes us grow every day, but sometimes it can make us happy when we feel bad. Food such as sea fish, bananas, pumpkins and chicken can help us be happy. How can they affect our feelings? People living by the sea look much happier than other people, because the fresh sea air helps them clear their minds and they eat a lot of sea fish. Bananas have much Vitamin B6. Having more bananas can help us make a quick decision, and become more confident . Eating pumpkins can also help people get into a good feeling because it's rich in Vitamin B6 and iron .

We can infer from the article that _ .	"In China, chain restaurants -- especially the big multinational ones -- are cool. Going to Starbucks, for example, is a status symbol. It not only says, ""I'm rich enough to buy this overpriced coffee,"" but also, ""I'm cosmopolitan enough to be part of globalization."" Where I come from in the UK, however, chains are neither fashionable nor gourmet . Chains are where you go on New Year's Day when nowhere else is open, or when you are 5 years old and your parents can't stand hearing, ""I'm huuuuuungry!"" any longer. In my own case (with regards to McDonald's), a chain is where you are taken on your first ""date"". Even at the age of 13, I knew to give the guy the ""let's just be friends"" phone call the next day. In the UK, independent cafes and restaurants are making a comeback on the fashion scene. Nowadays, a Londoner who says ""let's meet for a coffee at Monmouth"" (an independent cafe) is much cooler than one who says ""let's go to Starbucks"". Even if Monmouth's coffee is a little more expensive, there's a satisfaction in knowing your pounds aren't going straight to the big corporations. Of course, there are chain stores all over the UK; you can't go five minutes without spotting a Costa Coffee. But numbers do not add up to good taste. I do, however, have a confession . After moving to China I had moments when all the rice and Kung Pao Chicken became too much. I, too, have _ to McDonald's."	"[""many Britons don't like big corporations""]"
All the jobs Peter had taken had one thing in common: _ .	Peter, a high school student, was pretty busy with school, and he was on the soccer team. High school was hard, because everyone wanted to have nice clothes, hang out, drive cars, and all these cost money. Peter's father was the sort of guy that believed you had to earn whatever you got, so he wasn't just about to hand over lots of money for Peter to use to have fun. So, he had to get a job. During his freshman year summer vacation, his classmate got him a job working on a hay farm. He threw hay up into wagons as the tractor drove around fields, and then they stacked it in the hot barn. It was a hot, lowpaying job. He once worked a few nights a week at a grocery store. He put things on the shelf. It was a lot of lifting and carrying, and his arms were strong from this and the previous job. It was dull and didn't pay much. He took some time off when soccer got serious, but the following summer he tried working at a lumber yard. It was hot outside, but he got a lot of exercise lifting and carrying things like boards and drywall. He also learned a lot about building supplies. It still didn't pay well. From there, he spent a year doing some tutoring for a friend of the family, but that was piecemeal. His first real job came the last year at school, when he fixed registers and worked on computers at a big box store. It was his favorite job yet, but it still didn't pay well. What Peter realized with all of these jobs was that he needed a better paying job! The only way to get that was to get trained or educated. He could go to school and get a 2year degree in an office or technical position. His other choices were going to a 4year college or joining the army. He wasn't sure what he was going to do yet, but he knew he had to do something. Jobs were a lot of work, money was hard to earn, but he liked staying busy and being able to buy things. Peter wanted the most out of life, and that meant education.	"[""They didn't pay well""]"
Why did the author decide to drink the recommended amount of water?	You might think I'd have little in common with a camel, but we do share one useful skill: both of us can go for a very long time without water. Usually I start my day with a cup of tea, and then I might have a glass of water with my lunch and one with dinner, that's about a liter of liquid in 24 hours. It feels like plenty, but apparently it's not nearly enough. After years of suffering headaches and poor digestion I spoke to a neurologist about my regular headaches and a nutritionist about my poor digestion, and both told me I should be drinking up to three liters of liquid a day for my body to function at its best. I decided to conduct an experiment. What would happen if I drank the recommended amount every day for a month? The photograph of me taken the day I started this trial demonstrates perfectly and rather frighteningly what a lack of hydration does to a face. I am 42, but have to admit I look more like 52 in this picture, which is shocking. There are dark shadows under and around my eyes, which make me look exhausted, a profusion of wrinkles and strange reddish blotches, and my skin lacks any luster . It looks dead. Even my lips look shriveled . This is all classic evidence of poor hydration, apparently. Every system and function in our body depends on water. It flushes toxins from the vital organs, carries nutrients to cells, provides a moist environment for ear, nose and throat tissues, and eliminates waste. Not drinking enough means all these functions becomes damaged. So I decided to see how I would look and feel if I drank three liters of water every day for 28 days. The results were astonishing.

Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?	"Many people think that the BBC news programs are better than those on other channels because the BBC is not a commercial company. It pays for its programs from the television license money which everyone must pay if they have a television. The BBC, which is often known as ""Auntie"", is the biggest news collecting operation in the world. It has the world's largest network of foreign correspondents (;). Ten percent of the BBC's annual budget is spent on news collecting, reporting and presenting. More than 1,700 people work for the BBC news service. The BBC produces more than 214 hours of news and current affairs programs for radio and television each week. Each television news program costs about PS78,000 per hour and each radio news program costs approximately PS4,800 per hour. In the UK, about 19 million people -- almost 35% of the total population, watch the BBC television news progams every day. Developments in technology are improving news collection and presentation every year. The BBC now uses special cameras in the TV news studios to film the news presenters, and captions-- the words and sentences at the bottom of the screen, are now produced automatically by computer."

What's the best way to increase workers'effects?	Medical experts say most Americans do not get enough sleep. They say more Americans need to take a nap--that is to rest for a short time in the middle of the day. They give people advice to sleep lightly before continuing with other activities.The experts say naps might improve health by reducing pressure . Some western companies have supported the idea of napping for many years. They ask people to leave work, go home and have a nap before returning. In the United States, some companies let workers rest simply in their offices. They believe this can help workers make fewer mistakes and also increase the amount of work that a person can do. Sleep experts say it is likely that people make more mistakes at work than at other times. They say people should not carry out important tasks when they feel sleepy. And they say the best thing to do is to take a nap. About twenty minutes of rest is all you need. Experts say this provides extra energy and can increase your effects until the end of the day. But experts said that a nap should last no more than twenty to thirty minutes. A longer nap will put the body into deep sleep and waking up will be difficult.

It can inferred from the passage that _ .	Bringing Art into Hospitals The medical world is gradually realizing that the quality of the environment in hospitals may play an important role in helping patients to get better. As part of nationwide effort in Britain to bring art out of the museums and into public places, some of the country's best artists have been called in to change older hospitals and to soften the hard edges of modern buildings. Of the 2500 national health service hospitals in Britain, almost 100 now have very valuable collections of present art in passages, waiting areas and treatment rooms. These recent movements first started by one artist, Peter Senior, who set up his studio at a Manchester hospital in northeastern England during the early 1970s.He felt the artist had lost his place in modern society, and that art should be enjoyed by a wider audience . A common hospital waiting room might have as many as 5 000 visitors each week. What a better place to hold regular exhibitions of art! Senior held the first exhibition of his own paintings in the out--patient's waiting area of the Manchester Royal Hospital in 1975.Believed to be Britain's first hospital artist. Senior was so much in demand that he was soon joined by a team of six young art school graduates. The effect is striking. Now in the passages and waiting rooms the visitor experiences a full view of fresh colours, playful images and restful courtyards. The quality of the environment may reduce the need for expensive drugs when a patient is recovering from an illness. A study has shown that patients who had a view onto gardens needed half the number of strong pain killers compared with patients who had no view at all or only a brick wall to look at.

In the opinion of the author, how should we fight against childhood obesity?	Nobody likes home economics . But restoring the program could help us in the fight against obesity and chronic diseases today. The home economics movement was founded on the belief that housework and food preparation were important subjects that should be studied scientifically. The first classes occurred in the agricultural and technical colleges that were built in the 1860s. When most departments of universities rejected women, home economics was a back door into higher education. Indeed, in the early 20th century, home economics was a serious subject When few people understood germ theory and almost no one had heard of vitamins, home economics classes offered vital information about washing hands regularly, eating fruits and vegetables and not feeding coffee to babies. However, today we remember only the fixed ideas about home economics, forgetting the movement's most important lessons on healthy eating and cooking. Too many Americans simply don't know how to cook. Our diets, consisting of highly processed foods made cheaply outside the home, have contributed to many serious health problems. In the last decade, many cities and states have tried to tax junk food heavily or to ban the use of food stamps to buy soda. Clearly, many people are doubtful about any governmental steps to promote healthy eating. But what if the government put the tools of obesity prevention in the hands of children themselves by teaching them how to cook? My first experience with home economics happened two decades ago when I was a seventh grader in a North Carolina public school. A year later, my father's job took our family to Wales, where I attended a large school for a few months. It was the first time I had ever really cooked anything. I remember that it was fun, and with an instructor standing by, it wasn't hard. Those lessons stuck with me when I first started cooking for my husband and myself after college and they still do. Teaching cooking in public schools can help solve some problems facing Americans today. The history of home economics shows it's possible.	['Children should be taught how to cook.']
Most of Australians live_.	The Australian continent is a land like no other. Its animals, plants and landscapes have evolved over one thousand years, and there are about a million different natural species in Australia. More than 80 per cent of the country's plants and animals are unique to prefix = st1 /Australia, along with most of the fish and almost half the birds. Australia has more than 140 species of marsupials ,including koalas, wombats and the Tasmanian devil, now found only in the Australian wilderness. More than 750 species of birds have been recorded in Australia, 350 of which are found nowhere else in the world. Among them are the kookaburra, the rainbow lorikeet and fairy penguins. There are also 55 differernt species of macropods--the kangaroo family--native toAustralia. They vary greatly in size and weight, ranging from half a kilogram to 90 kilograms. The country has been making every effort to protect its natural heritage. Despite the large size of the continent, the majority of Australians live on the coast and in major cities--around 75 per cent of Australia's population lives in city areas. Australia is the driest continent on earth. Its center has one of the lowest rainfalls in the world and about three-quarters of the land is dry. These dry areas extend from the large central deserts to the western coast. Soils in these areas are very poor compared to other deserts. This has given Australians a great challenge.They have to make the best use of the variety of regions to meet the competing demands of agriculture, economy and conservation.	['in the coastal cities']
How are women's lives explored in this book?	Mothers and daughters go through so much--yet when was the last time a mother and daughter sat down to write a book together about it all? Perri Klass and her mother, Sheila Solomon Klass, both gifted professional writers, prove to be ideal co-writers as they examine their decades of motherhood, daughterhood, and the wonderful ways their lives have overlapped . Perri notes with amazement how closely her own life has mirrored her mother's: both have full-time careers; both have published books, articles, and stories; each has three children; they both love to read. They also love to travel--in fact, they often take trips together. But in truth, the harder they look at their lives, the more they acknowledge their big differences in circumstance and basic nature. A child of the Depression , Sheila was raised in Brooklyn by parents who considered education a _ for girls. Starting with her college education, she has fought for everything she's ever accomplished. Perri, on the other hand, grew up privileged in the New Jersey suburbs of the 1960s and 1970s. For Sheila, wasting time or money is a crime, and luxury is unthinkable while Perri enjoys the occasional small luxury, but has not been successful at trying to persuade her mother into enjoying even the tiniest thing she likes. Each writing in her own unmistakable voice, Perri and Sheila take turns exploring the joys and pains, the love and bitterness, the minor troubles and lasting respect that have always bonded them together. Sheila describes the adventure of giving birth to Perri in a tiny town in Trinidad where her husband was doing research fieldwork. Perri admits that she can't sort out all the mess in the households, even though she knows it drives her mother crazy. Together they compare thoughts on bringing up children and working, admit long-hidden sorrows, and enjoy precious memories. Looking deep into the lives they have lived separately and together, Perri and Sheila tell their mother-daughter story with honesty, humor, enthusiasm, and admiration for each other. A written account in two voices, Every Mother Is a Daughter is a duet that produces a deep, strong sound with the experiences that all mothers and daughters will recognize.

On Boy's Day,you may not see _ .	On Boy's Day,children don't have to go to school.Every family with a boy hangs up huge carpshaped flags.The flags are usually three colors:black(representing the father),red (representing the mother)and blue(representing the son). Japanese parents believe that the flags will bring their boys good luck and give them courage and power. May 5th is Japanese Children's Day. But since the festival is mainly celebrated by boys,it is usually called Boy's Day. The celebration of Boy's Day has a long history.It is said that the festival is derived from the Dragon Boat Festival in China. On this day,Japanese boys eat a special kind of rice cake. It is covered with a leaf and filled with bean paste .Children love to eat it. And eggs on leaves are another traditional food. Japanese children are so happy that they have three festivals each year. In addition to Boy's Day,they also have Girl's Day and the 753 Festival. Girl's Day is the girl's festival on March 3. It is also called the Doll's Festival because on that day,families get a set of dolls at home for their daughters. It is celebrated because the parents want their daughters to be strong and healthy. The 753 Festival is for children aged three, five and seven years old. Japanese people think that these three ages are the luckiest ones in one's life. On that day, these children get special candies wrapped in beautiful bags.The candy is a symbol of a long and healthy life for these children. The 753 Festival falls in November.	['dolls']
It seems that people can enjoy Carols by Candlelight because of _ .	Christmas in Australia is often very hot. Whereas the northern hemisphere is in the middle of winter, Australians are baking in summer heat. It is not unusual to have Christmas Day well into the mid 30 degrees Celsius, or near 100 degrees Fahrenheit. A traditional meal includes a turkey dinner, with ham, and pork. A flaming Christmas plum pudding is added for dessert. In the Australian gold rushes, Christmas puddings often contained a gold nugget. Today a small favor is baked inside. Whoever finds this knows s/he will enjoy good luck. Another treat is Mince Pies. Some Australians and particularly tourists often have their Christmas dinner at midday on a local beach, Bondi Beach in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs attracts thousands of people on Christmas Day. Other families enjoy their day by having a picnic. If they are at home, the day is punctuated by swimming in a pool, playing Cricket out the backyard, and other outdoor activities. The warm weather allows Australians to enjoy a tradition which started in 1937. Carols by Candlelight is held every year on Christmas Eve, where tens of thousands of people gather in the city of Melbourne to sing their favorite Christmas songs. The evening is lit by as many candles singing under a clean cut night sky. The sky with its Southern Cross stars is like a mirror. Sydney and the other capital cities also enjoy Carols in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Australians surround themselves with Christmas Bush, a native plant which has little red flowered leaves.

The author mentions Robert A.Emmons'book Thanks! in order to prove that _ .	Mom was right!If you say thank you,for even the smallest gift or slightest show of kindness,you'll feel happy. Gratitude ,says Robert A.Emmons,a professor of psychology at the University of California,is an important element of happiness.In his recent book,Thanks!,Emmons uses the first major study on gratitude to prove mom's point.In acknowledging and developing this muchignored expression of thankfulness,he explains how people have benefited--even improved their health. As one of the leading scholars of the positive psychology movement,he admits gratitude may be difficult to express.He advises you to begin by admitting that life is good and full of events and elements that make daily existence a wonder.Second,recognize that the source of life's goodness is more than just you.That source may be your mom,a friend,partner,child,colleague at work or play,or any combination of these. Gratitude is always otherdirected,notes Emmons.You can be pleased or angry with yourself and feel guilty about doing something wrong,but you can never be grateful to or for yourself. Expressing gratitude shouldn't be a reaction;it should be a state of mind.To feel grateful when life is a breeze and you have more than you need is easy.To feel grateful in time of crisis--anger,hatred and bitterness--is easier.Also,too many people are aware of life's blessings only after these are lost.The voices expressing gratitude from his studies of individuals are many. It's crisis and chaos--danger,disease,disability and death--that bring many individuals to realize just how dependent they are on others.Yet it's the way each of us begins life and ends it.It's too bad that so many people waste those decades in between labouring under the illusion they are selfsufficient,says Emmons. To enable and embrace gratitude,Emmons encourages the readers of Thanks! to keep a gratitude diary.He even provides easytofollow directions on how to practise and develop gratitude. I'm not a reader or advocate of selfhelp books,but I am thankful for the reference I found in a newspaper article to the research Emmons was conducting on gratitude involving organ donors and recipients .The chance discovery led me to this book. Mom implied that kindness seems to find its way back to the giver because life really is all about giving,receiving and repaying.So I'll pay attention to her professional advice and say:Thank you,professor Emmons.

Finger-prints have often been used as a method of solving criminal case because it _ .	"Every human being has a unique arrangement of the skin on his fingers and this arrangement is unchangeable. Scientists and experts have proved the uniqueness of finger-prints and discovered that no exactly similar pattern is passed on from parents to children, though nobody knows why this is the case. The ridge structure on a person's fingers does not change with growth and is not affected by surface injuries. Burns, cuts and other damage to the outer part of the skin will be replaced in time by new one which bears a reproduction of the original pattern. It is only when the inner skin is injured that the arrangement will be destroyed. Some criminals make use of this fact to remove their own finger-prints but this is a dangerous and rare step to take. Finger-prints can be made very easily with printer's ink. They can be recorded easily. With special methods, identification can be achieved successfully within a short time. Because of the simplicity and economy of this system, finger-prints have often been used as a method of solving criminal case. A suspected man may deny a charge but this may be in vain. His finger-prints can prove who he is even if his appearance has been changed by age or accident. When a suspect leaves finger-prints behind at the scene of a crime, they are difficult to detect with the naked eye. Special techniques are used to ""develop"" them. Some of the marks found are incomplete but identification is possible if a print of a quarter of an inch square can be obtained."	['is simple and not expensive']
When did Zoe Lemon write the letter?	"More than two decades ago, a 10-year-old schoolgirl threw a bottle into the sea off the coast of Hull as she went on a ship on a family holiday, hoping to get a response from a stranger in a faraway land. Inside the bottle was a scrawled letter from Zoe Lemon, a youngster with a love of ""ballet, playing the flute and the piano"", who had just boarded a ship heading for a holiday in Germany. She told her expected recipients of her pet hamster and fish, both called Sparkle, and her parents who were both teachers. Miss Lemon, of Salford, Greater Manchester, soon forgot about her act of fantastic, eventually marrying and having a child herself. But this Christmas she was extremely surprised to receive a reply after 23 years. It turned out to be a reply to her letter from Piet and Jacqueline Lateur from near Rotterdam. Mr Lateur was walking his dog in the Oosterschelde dykes , near where he and his wife live in Serooskerke, when he found the bottle with Zoe's letter inside. Mrs Averianov, 33, who works in a jewellery shop, said: ""It's been a bit crazy really. My parents came to visit on Christmas day and they had this letter from Europe addressed to my , Lemon. Since receiving the letter, Mrs Averianov has been in contact with Mr Lateur via email and asked to see photographs of where the bottle was found. He told her: ""I am keeping your little letter on my piano. I know you are no longer a little girl but you asked me to write you so I have."" Mrs Averianov's father, John Lemon, 68, had encouraged his daughter to throw the message into the sea on a family holiday and now she is considering doing the same for her five-year-old son Maksim. She said: ""I'll probably wait until he's a bit older and can understand and write a letter, but maybe we'll do it by attaching it to a balloon."" From , (Jan,2014)"	['In 1990.']

""It is not 'Can we do it?' but 'Should we do it?'"" he told the BBC.""The technical part is not complex, but I don't think that's going to be the very great difficulty.

She rejected the idea that the procedure would mean people would end up living with a dead person's face. ""There are so many people without faces, I have half a face... but we are all so much more than just a face... you don't take on their personality. You are still you,"" she told reporters.

What attitude does the editorial in the Southern Metropolis News hold towards the ban?	"From Sept. 1, Chinese children will be able to watch domestic cartoon programs during 5 p.m. every day, according to a regulation by prefix = st1 /China's TV watchdog. The State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) has decided to ban all foreign cartoons during the ""Golden hours"", reported the Beijing News. No foreign cartoons or programs of introducing foreign cartoons can be shown during the period on all domestic cartoon channels, the regulation says. Only after 8 p.m. can foreign cartoons appear on TV, it requires. The regulation has been issued to local TV stations but the administration has not made it public, according to the newspaper. Cartoon programs co-produce by domestic and foreign producers will have to get approval from SARFT to show during 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. from Sept.1. The first foreign cartoon introduced to Chinawas a Japanese cartoon called ""Astro Boy"" series in 1981. Since then, a large quantity of foreign cartoons _ China. Incomplete surveys show about 80 percent of interviewed Chinese children like foreign cartoons according to the Southern Metropolis News. With the effects of regulations and establishment of 15 film and cartoon production bases in recent years, domestic cartoon industry attracted huge civil investment, resulting in a sharp rise of cartoon programs in 2005. However, due to the poor popularity among children, domestic cartoons found it hard to show during ""golden hours"", and even had troubles to get back the production costs. Moreover, it was the content of domestic cartoons that lost the audience, said the editorial, therefore improving the creation environment of cartoon makers is much wiser than such market-protecting measures. Finally it said it was reasonable and necessary to introduce system into the cartoon competition to protect the domestic industry, the complete prohibition of foreign cartoons and compulsory screening of domestic ones during popular hours was rather unreasonable. ""This is a worrying, short-sighted policy and would not solve the fundamental problems in China's cartoon industry,"" it concluded."	['He raises a storm of objections to the ban.']
The author wrote this passage mainly to _ .	When I was in primary school, sometimes I would meet a girl of the same age as me. Lisa was never active, but she was always very sweet and nice. In the 5th grade she came to my class. She was absent a lot , and one day I had the courage to ask why. She told me she was sick, and she explained she wore a wig because her medicine made her lose her hair. We left it at that. Anytime Lisa came to class--seldom--I would hang around with her on the playground. I received much ridicule from my friends for this because they thought I was ignoring them for Lisa. My family education taught me to be nice, and I felt Lisa's needs were much more important than others I knew. It had been months since Lisa was in our class, and one day our teacher was crying. She explained Lisa died the day before and would no longer be our classmate. She told us Lisa had fought a battle with cancer for years. I was shocked. Lisa never spoke of her illness as if it could kill her. Well, all these years I have kept Lisa in my mind and heart. When I go through the important events in my life, I think of Lisa. I've had a strong wish recently to find her mother and father. I'd like to tell them that though they never met me, their daughter had a sweet effect on my life. I have no idea what her parents' first names are. I write to your column and hope you can point me in the right direction. Lisa was such a lovely girl. Maybe her parents would be comforted by the fact that after all these years they are not the only ones who remember her.	"[""ask for help to find a friend's parents""]"

How did Obama get people to vote?	"Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii. His father came to America from Kenya, which is a country in Africa. His parents, Ann and Barack, met when they were students at the University of Hawaii. Since Barack had the same name as his father, young Barack went by the nickname ""Barry"". In 1979, after he finished high school, Barry went to Occidental College in Los Angeles, California. There, he started to learn about his African roots and decided to use his African name, Barack. After two years in L.A., he went to Columbia University in New York City to study politics. After college, he moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he worked to help poor people in his city. He traveled to Africa to meet his grandmother and cousins for the first time. He went back many times over the years to visit with his family and learn about where he came from. At work, he met a lawyer named Michelle Robinson. They worked together in a big law firm. Then he left Chicago to go to Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He did very well in law school. After he was done with school, Barack moved back to Chicago and in 1992 he married Michelle. He worked as a lawyer, devoted to helping poor people for free who had been treated unfairly. He worked hard to get the people he helped to vote . He made many people believe that their votes were important, and helped them feel like they could make a difference."

From the passage, we can know that _ .	"Spending more than two hours a night doing homework leads to better results in English,math and science, according to a major study (by Pam Sammons, England) which has tracked the progress of3,000 children over the past 15 years. Spending any time doing homework showed advantages, but the influence was greater for the students who put in two to three hours a night, according to the study published by the Department for Education in England. The scientists who did the research say their study empbasizes what students actually do rather than how much work the school has set. Pam Sammons, a professor of education at Oxford University, said that time spent on homework showed the influence of the school-if children were expected to do homework and if they enjoy their subjects. ""That's one of the reasons Indian and Chinese children do better.They put more time in it."" he added. It's also reported that students who enjoyed school got better results. ""Schools could make sure children had a better experience by improving the school environment, making school work interesting and making children feel supported by teachers."" Sammons said. It is suggested that children aged 5 t0 7 should be set one-hour homework a week, half an hour a night for 7 t0 11-year-olds. Secondary schools were encouraged to set up two hours a night for 14 t0 16-year-olds. ""Head teachers should make their own homework policy ,"" the government says."

What is the major characteristic of the new society today ?	The Knowledge Society According to American economist Peter Drucker, every few hundred years in Western history a sharp transformation takes place in which society rearranges itself. One such period happened between 1455 and 1517, beginning with the invention of the printing press, and included the Renaissance, the European discovery of America, a reawakening of science, and the Protestant Reformation. All these events had significant effects on the development of Western society. The next period lasted from the American Revolution and the Perfection of the steam engine in 1776 until Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815. During this time, the Industrial Revolution took place, public schools systems were established on a large scale, the first modern university was founded in Berlin in 1809, and both capitalism and communism emerged as economic and political ideologies. Again, society had been altered.Drucker suggested that another services to them.	['Knowledge will be used as an economic resource.']

"The author used the phrase ""go under"" (Sentence 3, Para. 3) to mean _ ."	Many private institutions of higher education around the country are in danger. Not all will be saved, and perhaps not all deserve to be saved. There are low-quality schools just as there are low-quality businesses. We have no duty to save them simply because they exist. But many promising institutions that deserve to continue are threatened. They are doing a fine job educationally, but they are caught in a financial squeeze, with no way to reduce rising cost or increase income significantly. Raising tuition doesn't bring in more income, for each time tuition goes up, the enrollment goes down, or the amount that must be given away in student aid goes up. Schools are bad businesses, whether public or private, not usually because of mismanagement but because of the nature of the enterprise. They lose money on every customer, and they can go bankrupt either from too few students or too many students. Even a very good college is a very bad business. It is such colleges, promising but threatened, that I worry about. Low enrollment is not their chief problem. Even with full enrollment, they may _ . Efforts to save them, and preferably to keep them private, are a national necessity. There is no basis for arguing that private schools are inherently better than public schools. There are many examples to the contrary. Anyone can name state universities and colleges that rank as the finest in the nation and the world. It is now inevitable that public institutions will be dominant, and therefore diversity is a national necessity. Diversity in the way we support schools tends to give us a healthy diversity in the forms of education. In an imperfect society such as ours, uniformity of education throughout the nation could be dangerous, In an imperfect society, diversity is a positive good. Supporters of public higher education know the importance of sustaining private higher education.	['get into difficulties']
The text is mainly about _ .	Box jellyfish are the most poisonous marine animals known to man. They measure 3 meters long and weigh up to 2 kilograms. They are pale blue and transparent in color, and get their name from the cube--like shape of their body, Box jellyfish have 6 eyes on all 4 sides of their body, although it is uncertain how they process what they see as they do not have a central nervous system. They also have up to 15 tentacles growing from each corner of their body that have about 5,000 stinging cells each. Box jellyfish can be found primarily in the coastal waters off Northern Australia as well as throughout the Indo--Pacific. They prefer to live at river mouths. They do not have any organs to breathe, and will sleep on the ocean floor from 3 pm to dawn. Unlike other jellyfish that merely move along with the current, box jellyfish have developed a way to travel wherever they want to go. _ will shoot themselves in a jet-like fashion, reaching speeds of up to 7.4 kilometers per hour. The diet of box jellyfish consists of thing like fish, small animals, and even other jellyfish. They use their venom, a chemical which causes heart, skin, and breath failure, to kill their prey . Since box jellyfish have eyes, some scientists believe that they actively hunt their prey while others insist that they are just passive opportunists that will wait and catch anything that wanders into their tentacles. Box jellyfish are responsible for more human deaths in Australia than snakes, sharks, and salt-water crocodiles combined. It is best to avoid them as most stings will result in death. Hopefully, humans and box jellyfish can find a way to live with one another while keeping conflicts to a bare minimum. After all, such a unique species of jellyfish deserves to live and grow just as humans do.	['a kind of sea animal']
"In Para. 4, ""neighbors opened their windows and stepped onto their porches"" probably because _ ."	"Every April I am troubled by the same concern -- that spring might not occur this year. The landscape looks dull, with hills, sky and forest appearing gray. My spirits ebb, as they did during an April snowfall when I first came to Maine 15 years ago. ""Just wait,"" a neighbor advised. ""You'll wake up one morning and spring will just be here."" And look, on May 3 that year I awoke to a green so amazing as to be almost electric, as if spring were simply a matter of flipping a switch. Hills, sky and forest revealed their purples, blues and green. Leaves had unfolded and daffodils were fighting their way heavenward. Then there was the old apple tree. It sits on an undeveloped lot in my neighborhood. It belongs to no one and therefore to everyone. The tree's dark twisted branches stretch out in unpruned abandon. Each spring it blossoms so freely that the air becomes filled with the scent of apple. Until last year, I thought I was the only one aware of this tree. And then one day, in a bit of spring madness, I set out with pruner to remove a few disorderly branches. No sooner had I arrived under the tree than neighbors opened their windows and stepped onto their porches. These were people I barely knew and seldom spoke to, but it was as if I had come uninvited into their personal gardens. My mobile-home neighbor was the first to speak.""You're not cutting it down, are you?"" she asked anxiously. Another neighbor frowned as I cut off a branch. ""Don't kill it, now,"" he warned. Soon half the neighborhood had joined me under the apple tree. It struck me that I had lived there for five years and only now was learning these people's names, what they did for a living and how they passed the winter. It was as if the old apple tree was gathering us under its branches for the purpose of both acquaintanceship and shared wonder. I couldn't help recalling Robert Frost's words: The trees that have it in their pent-up buds To darken nature and be summer woods One thaw led to another. Just the other day I saw one of my neighbors at the local store. He remarked how this recent winter had been especially long and complained of not having seen or spoken at length to anyone in our neighborhood. And then, he looked at me and said, ""We need to prune that apple tree again."""	['they were concerned about the safety of the tree']
What happened when the monk meditated?	We often see wind-horse flags in Tibetan areas. They are long cloths on which pictures of horses and scriptures are printed. People often put these flags on top of houses, or leave them where a vehicle accident happened. They prevent evil spirits from injuring people again. A wind-horse flag can be white, yellow, red, green or blue. These five colors symbolize the five elements that form the world; earth, water, fire, wind and sky. Another explanations that red is the sun, green is the grassland, yellow is the earth, blue is the sky, and white is the cloud. The wind-horse flag originated with a monk who obtained a scripture from India. When he crossed a river, he carelessly dropped the scripture into the water. He quickly saved the scripture and spread it out on a big rock to dry as he sat in meditation . Suddenly violent thunder sounded like drums. The monk felt liberated from all of his sadness, and when he opened his eyes he saw that the scripture had been blown into the sky by a strong wind. Finally, he went straight to heaven. In order to honor the spirit of the monk and the Buddhist scripture, people printed the scripture on a piece of cloth and hung it up between the sky and the earth as though the scripture was flying in the sky. We also know why people put the wind-horse flag on the top of mountains and houses. The Tibetan ancestors had a very great idea about chanting scripture. They thought people not only could chant scripture, but also the five elements. The wind-home flag is a good example of how they use the wind to blow the flag, which means that the wind also chants scripture.	['The scripture was blown into the sky.']

Take a look at the following two examples from the list of ""101 things not to do"": Swim with Dolphins ? Swimming with dolphins is one of the world's most profitable tourist activities. However, every dolphin will welcome having their busy, tiring day interrupted by tourists screaming and pushing around them in the water. Worse yet, when dolphins get too near to the boats loaded with tourists, they could get caught up in ropes and killed by propellers . Here's a little secret. Dolphins look like smiling at you, but actually they're just opening their mouths. Go to See the Mona Lisa? There must be something about the mysterious smile. The 6 million people who visit the lady in the Louvre every year can't all be wrong, after all. But they can be quite annoying, standing in front of you, holding up their cameras to prevent you from seeing anything. In fact, it is hard for you to see the painting clearly because you have to stay away from it for security reasons. After queuing for hours, many tourists can remain in front of the painting only for 15 seconds at most. If the mysterious lady in the picture knew her fate, she wouldn't just be smiling, she'd be laughing. So, still long to see the Mona Lisa?

How has the city of Copenhagen persuaded its people to accept the windmills around their homes?	"While other countries debate whether to fix wind turbines offshore or in distant areas, Denmark is building them right in its capital. Three windmills were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97. ""We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,"" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. ""But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must."" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital. With wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power. Now turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption. Though considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. ""Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,"" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares. Each share represents 1,000 kW hours/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares. Involving the local population was a smart move. ""There are a lot of things you can do close to people if it's not too big and if there's a model where locals feel involved and get to share in the profit. Knowing that you, or your neighbours, own a technology creates a very different atmosphere than if a multinational owned it,"" says Vad Mathiesen. Going green? Yes. Accepted by the population? Yes. Going with centuries-old city architecture? Hardly. Certainly, the three turbines don't exactly _ the 18th-century city centre, as they are in a neighbourhood 3 km away. According to the mayor's office, none of the remaining 97 turbines will rise in architecturally sensitive areas. But Sascha Haselmayer, CEO of city creation group Citymart, warns, ""With Denmark being a world-leading producer of windmills, there is a risk that the answer to every energy question is windmills."" ""We've destroyed mountains and lakes in order to support our lifestyle,"" notes Irena Bauman, an architect and professor at Sheffield University. ""Wind turbines are a sign that we're learning to live with nature. I hope we'll have them all over the world,"" she says. ""They may be unpleasant to some, but better-looking ones will come. It's just that we don't have time to wait for them!"""	['By offering them the chance to get the profit the windmills bring.']

"""The universality of toys"" lies in the fact that _ ."	There seems never to have been a civilization without toys, but when and how they developed is unknown. They probably came about just to give children something to do. In the ancient world, as is today, most boys play with some kinds of toys and most girls with another. In societies where social roles are strictly determined, boys pattern their play after the activities of their fathers and girls after the tasks of their mothers. This is true because boys and girls are being prepared, even in play, to step into the roles and responsibilities of the adult world. What is remarkable about the history of toys is not so much how they changed over the centuries but how much they have remained the same. It is the universality of toys about their development in all parts of the world and their continuing to the present that is amazing. In Egypt, the Americas, China, Japan and among the Arctic peoples, generally the same kinds of toys appeared. Nearly every civilization had dolls, little weapons, toy soldiers, tiny animals and vehicles. Because toys can be generally regarded as a kind of art form, they have not been subject to technological progress that characterizes inventions for adult use. The progress from the wheel to the oxcart to the automobile is a direct line of advancement. The progress from a rattle used by a baby in 3,000 BC to one used by an infant today, however, is not characterized by inventiveness. Each rattle is the product of the artistic tastes of the times and subject to the limitations of materials then ready for use.

She gift-wrapped the purse and thanked me for my business, and I rode off home with the package under my arm. When my mother opened the gift the next Sunday morning, she asked in an accusing tone, ""Where did you get this?"" ""I bought it at the Agins. It cost me $11."" I said. My mother was shocked into silence. It wasn't until many years later, when I learned that the purse was worth several hundred dollars, that I appreciated just how wonderful Sylvia Agins had been to me. I always felt bad that I never had a chance to properly thank her.

The family took the duck to a doctor who treats animals.The doctor gave the duck to the Goose Creek Animal Sanctuary .Animal sanctuaries provide homes for animals and teach people about their care. The doctor said it was easy to understand why people thought the duck was dead.

A school bus must go _ .	China's long-awaited rules on school bus safety finally came into force on Tuesday, including a list of ways aimed at reducing the risk of accident. Among the biggest changes is that buses carrying students will be given priority in traffic, while companies and drivers will need licenses to offer school transport services. Officials have spent more than four months making the rules, during which time the country has been shocked by several big crashes because of overcrowded school buses. The latest accident happened on Monday in Yangchun, Guangdong province, in which three kindergarten pupils were killed and 14 others injured. Rules and funding In the new rules, a school bus is considered as a vehicle with more than seven seats that is transporting children receiving the State's nine-year compulsory education (ages 6 to 15) to or from school. This can also be for preschoolers if a parent is unable to take them to or from kindergarten . School buses must also operate in routes marked in the map by governments to ensure safety. Punishment Companies and bus drivers who fail to meet the rules face the punishment. Drivers against the rules will be fined 200 yuan ($32) and vehicles will be taken away from its owner if they have been used as an unlicensed school bus.	['the same way all the days']

People choose couchsurfing while traveling mainly to _ .	"While traveling satisfies different needs of various types of people, most serious adventurers hope to make some connections while they're experiencing another culture. Discovering another way of life is fascinating, and leads to a deeper understanding of one's own culture as well. However, it can be difficult to get to know people and customs if one's trip is spent at a hotel. A better choice for gaining insight into the culture of a country is couchsurfing. Couchsurfing is free, and guarantees a close encounter of some sort, as it allows you to stay on a local's couch or in a guest room. Travelers can look up couchsurfing opportunities on Couchsurfing.com, where hosts and surfers can connect, create and view profiles, and exchange information. ""Meeting their friends, seeing how they function and seeing how people were actually living are so personal. I really like the opportunity to gain a pure knowledge of someone's life,"" says Meghan Sinnott, who recently couchsurfed in Denmark, Holland, and Sweden. The formal Couchsurfing Project has been around for a while. It was started in 1999 by Casey Fenton, who was on a cheap trip to Iceland from Boston. Finding himself without a place to stay, he e-mailed more than a thousand students at the University of Iceland and got more than 50 responses offering him a free couch. When he returned to his hometown Boston, he decided to turn the experience into a website-based network, which was created in 2004. While some travelers might be afraid of the idea of sleeping on a previously unseen couch or getting a cup of coffee with a complete stranger halfway across the country, others jump at the chance to walk into the unknown. And that tells us exactly what couchsurfing is all about--learning about the world and a stranger at a time."	['experience different cultures']
What does the author suggest smart firms do?	"Digital technology -- email and smart phones especially--have vastly improved workers' ability to be productive outside of a traditional office. Even so, most white-collar work still happens in an office. One reason is that, according to findings of a new survey of office workers conducted by Wakefield Research for the IT company Citrix, most bosses are doubtful about remote working. Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it, and only 35 percent say it's tolerated. Skeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while ""working"" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner. It is true, however, that working at home makes people much more efficient , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush. The fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker. More broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who haven't worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home. Under such circumstances, smart firms need to find ways to let their employees have enough ability to change or be changed easily to suit a different situation to manage their time efficiently."

According to the passage, the Metropolitan Opera in New York City _ .	"Think of some of your favorite singers. When you listen, they can make you happy or sad, peaceful or angry. They can make you relax or want to get up and dance. Gifted singers have the power to affect us in many ways -- emotionally, physically and mentally. But becoming a great singer isn't as easy as listening to one. It takes practice, devotion and strong lungs! Just ask the well-known American opera star Carol Vaness. At the Metropolitan Opera in prefix = st1 /New York Citywhere she often sings, Carol's voice must be loud enough to be heard by four thousand people. It must reach every person in the theater, without a microphone, even when she's singing softly. The reason Carol can project her voice that far is the way she breathes. ""When you breathe, it's like a swimmer taking a deep breath before going underwater,"" Carol explains. ""You have to take a lot of air into your lungs."" According to Carol, the main difference between pop singing and opera is ""how you breathe, how much air you take in, and how you control it coming out. Regular singing is more like speaking, and it's a lot softer. When I sing for children, they're often surprised by how the vibrations strike their ears -- like waves on a beach, "" Carol says. ""In opera, the air doesn't just go out of your mouth -- it vibrates in your chest, the way a guitar vibrates when it's played. "" Ever since she started piano lessons at the age of ten, Carol has loved music. As she got older, she decided to become a music teacher. When she went to college, she took singing lessons as part of her studies. Her voice teacher discovered that nineteen-year-old Carol had an exceptionally beautiful soprano voice - the highest singing voice for women. Carol decided to make opera her goal, not only because she loved to sing but also because she loved the drama. Opera is a play in which the characters sing the words instead of speaking them. The stories of opera can be tragic or comical. They can be personal stories about two people falling in love or grand stories about kings and queens who lived long ago. As the characters in an opera sing, the emotions expressed by words and music come to life. Today, Carol performs throughout the United Statesand Europe and she has song for almost twenty years. But she has never forgotten where she started singing in the first palace. ""Put your heart into your singing and enjoy it,"" says Carol, ""because singing is a great joy. That's why I sing. In fact, that's why everybody sings. """	['can seat 4,000 people']
The first university was founded over _ years ago.	"Attending a university is an important part of a person's life. Today, many people go to a university to study and train for a future job in subjects like law, medicine, or education. But the university is not a modern invention. It has a history that is over a thousand years old. The world's oldest university, Al-Azhar, is in Cairo, Egypt. It was first built as a mosque in A.D. 972. A few years later, learners and teachers began meeting in the mosque in ""tutoring circles"". They read and talked about the subject of law. Around 988, leaders in the city of Cairo decided to create a school for higher learning and the University of Al-Azhar was founded. At Al-Azhar, there were many university 'firsts.' _ were created. The earliest ones taught at Al-Azhar were in law and religion. In a course, students read and studied with the teacher, but there was also free discussion. Often, students and teachers talked about a topic, and there was no 'right' answer. Finally, scholars from around the world came to Al-Azhar to teach and do research. At the university, people studied the past, but it was also a place for sharing new ideas. Over a thousand years later, Al-Azhar is still an important university in the world. Its library contains more than 250,000 of the world's oldest and most valuable books. Today, many of the world's most important universities such as Oxford and Harvard still follow the traditions started at Al-Azhar."	['a thousand']
Which of the following shows that the find of the glacier discovery is a surprise?	"Even though orbiters have eyed it from space and landers have rumbled across its surface, Mars still has more secrets to reveal. Two findings emerged this week: the possibility of an active glacier far from the planet's poles and evidence that sulfur--rather than carbon--was the element driving the planet's warmer climate long ago. Both discoveries could force some rethinking about Martian evolution and dynamics--and maybe even provide insights about Earth's past. The glacier discovery was announced Wednesday by the European Space Agency (ESA). A high-resolution stereo camera aboard ESA's Mars Express spacecraft spotted the feature in a region called Deuteronilus Mensae, located in the mid-north latitudes of the planet. The Mars Express science team drew the preliminary conclusion that the material in the feature is water ice and that it accumulated as recently as 10,000 years ago, probably from an underground source. Other deposits of water ice have been mapped at the martian poles, but they're much bigger and are millions of years old. The find is a surprise because the prevailing view is that any water reaching the martian surface from underground quickly evaporates and eventually drifts into space. Yet all of the physical characteristics of the feature are ""consistent with that of a glacier,"" says geologist and team member Ronald Greeley of Arizona State University in prefix = st1 /Tempe. Meanwhile, in the 21 December issue of Science, a team from HarvardUniversityand the Massachusetts Institute of Technology offers a possible solution for the curious absence of carbon-based minerals on Mars. A buildup of carbon dioxide in the ancient martian atmosphere supposedly produced enough of a greenhouse effect to allow liquid water to flow for a time on the surface. The problem is that such a process should have deposited ample carbon-containing minerals on the planet's surface--something that hasn't been found. So the researchers have come up with a new explanation: Large amounts of sulfur dioxide(SO2) in the atmosphere, the result of early volcanic activity, captured enough heat to allow water to flow. This would explain the plentiful distribution of sulfates among martian minerals."	"[""It is known to all water, or of similar physical characteristic can't exist on the Mars.""]"

The best but the most difficult way to solve the water problem of the world is to _ .	The world is not only hungry, but it is also thirsty for water. This may seem strange to you , since nearly 70% of the earth's surface is covered with water . But about 97% of that is sea water, or salt water. Man can only drink and use the other 3% -- the fresh water from rivers , lakes , underground , and other sources . And we can not even use all of that. Even worse, some of it has been made dirty. However, as things stand today, this fresh water is still enough for us . But our need for water is becoming larger and larger quickly -- almost day by day . We should take steps to do with this problem now and in this way we can get away from a serious world-wide water shortage later on . We all have to learn how to stop wasting our valuable water. One of the first steps is to develop ways of reusing it .Today in most large cities , water is used only once and then sent out into a sewer system . From there it returns to sea or runs into underground places. But even if every large city reused its water, we still would not have enough. All we'd have to do to make use of sea water in the world is to remove the salt . If we take these steps we'll be in no danger of drying up.	['remove the salt from sea water']
The passage is mainly developed by _ .	"We humans live in different parts of the world, but we have the same ""mother"". She gives us everything we need in our daily life. She is our Mother Earth. April 22 is Earth Day. The theme of this year is ""Green Cities"". A green city is a healthy and pleasant place for people to live, according to the United Nations. A green city can get its energy from renewable sources like solar and wind power. Also, it is connected by clean public transportation. Moreover, a green city is made up of facilities that can save energy and reduce waste. Around the world, many cities and countries have done well to build themselves in a green way. Chicago is well known for its green roof program. These roofs are covered with plants. The plants get a great amount of rainwater. Later, the water evaporates to help make the air cool and clean. So far, there are about 360 green roofs in Chicago, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency. Curitiba, Brazil, has great transportation. It opened the world's first bus rapid transit (BRT) system in 1974. BRT runs on special lanes. This makes sure that buses are on time even in traffic jams. With the help of BRT, the city has the lowest level of air pollution in Brazil. Today, many other countries have copied BRT, including China and Mexico. Singapore is home to the first zero-energy building in Southeast Asia. Zero energy means a building is able to create more energy than it uses. Zero-energy buildings work with solar panels mainly on roofs. These panels can make electricity which powers the buildings. By 2030, Singapore plans to build 80 percent of its buildings like this."

What can we learn about Patricia Harris from the passage?	"It was shortly before midnight, and Dr Patricia was getting ready for bed. The phone rang on the end of the line was a woman about to break a promise. The woman was her mother's neighbour.

The neighbour wisely decided to disobey orders. Harris desperately wanted to get to the hospital immediately, but she couldn't. She lives in Washington, D.C, and her mother lives in California.

According to the passage, some plant diseases can _ .	Plants, like animals, are subject to diseases of various kinds.It has been estimated that some 30,000 different diseases attack our economic plants; forty are known to attack corn, and about as many attack wheat.The results of unchecked plant disease are all too obvious in countries which have marginal food supplies.The problem will soon be more widespread as the population of the world increases at its frightening rate.Even in countries which are now amply fed by their agricultural products there could soon be the major crops; the resulting famines could kill millions of people, and the resulting hardship on other millions could cause political upheavals disastrous to the order of the world. Some plants have relative immunity to a great many diseases, while others have a susceptibility to them.A blight may be but a local infection easily controlled; on the other hand it can attack particular plants in a whole region or nation.An example is the blight which killed virtually every chestnut tree in North America.Another is the famous potato blight in Ireland in the last century.As a result of that, it was estimated that one million people died of starvation and related ailments. Plant pathologists have made remarkable strides in identifying the pathogens of the various diseases.Bacteria may invade a plant through an infestation of insect parasites carrying the pathogen.A plant can also be inoculated by man.Other diseases might be caused by fungus which attacks the plant in the form of a model or smut or rust.Frequently such a primary infection will weaken the plant so that a secondary infection may result form its lack of tolerance.The symptoms shown may cause an error in diagnosis, so that treatment may be directed toward bacteria which could be the result of a susceptibility caused by a primary virus infection.

"What should we do before attempting to ""read"" people?"	"Facial expressions carry meaning that is determined by situations and relationships. For example, in American culture the smile is in general an expression of pleasure. Yet it also has other uses. A woman's smile at a police officer does not carry the same meaning as the smile she gives to a young child. A smile may show love or politeness. It can also hide true feelings. It often causes confusion across cultures. For example, many people in Russia smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even improper. Yet many Americans smile freely at strangers in public places (although this is less common in big cities). Some Russians believe that Americans smile in the wrong places; some Americans believe that Russians don't smile enough. In Southeast Asian culture, a smile is frequently used to cover painful feelings. Vietnamese people may tell a sad story but end the story with a smile. Our faces show emotions, but we should not attempt to ""read"" people from another culture as we would ""read"" someone from our own culture. The fact that members of one culture do not express their emotions as openly as do members of another does not mean that they do not experience emotions. Rather, there are cultural differences in the amount of facial expressions permitted. For example, in public and in formal situations many Japanese do not show their emotions as freely as Americans do. When with friends, Japanese and Americans seem to show their emotions similarly. It is difficult to generalize about Americans and facial expressiveness because of personal and cultural differences in the United States. People from certain cultural backgrounds in the United States seem to be more facially expressive than others. The key is to try not to judge people whose ways of showing emotion are different. If we judge according to our own cultural habits, we may make the mistake of ""reading"" the other person incorrectly."	['Understand their cultural backgrounds.']

""Jack got a laptop for getting straight A's, and Laurie got a cell-phone,"" one boy said. ""Oh, yeah, and Sarah got an iPad, and she's only in third grade,"" said another. ""And how about Brian? He got $10 for each A."" I suddenly became concerned. These payoffs might get parents through grammar school, but what about high school and beyond? What would be left after the electric guitar, the cell-phone, and the DVD player? I saw the road ahead: _ I saw my comfortable lifestyle disappear before my eyes -- no more of those $5 bags of already-peeled organic carrots. No more organic anything! I started to feel surprised and nervous. Would every goal achieved by my two children fetch a reward? A high grade point average? A good class ranking? Would sports achievements be included in this reward system: soccer goals, touchdowns? What about the orchestra? Would first chair pay more than second? I'd be penniless by eighth-grade graduation. ""We never paid anything for good grades,"" said my neighbor across the street, whose son was recently accepted at MIT. ""He just did it on his own. Maybe once in a while we went out for pizza, but that's about it."" Don't you just hate that? We're all running around looking for the MP3 player with the most updates, and she's spending a few dollars on pizza. She gets motivation; we get negotiation. And what about the primary grades? What do these students get? ""When the teacher asked if anyone got rewards for good grades, everyone in my class raised their hands and said they got ice cream cones ,"" said one third-grader."

The world's smallest dog weighed half as much as _ according to the passage.	For thousands of years, people have lived with dogs. Ancient paintings on the walls of caves show people living with dogs. Almost a third of the homes in the United States and England have dogs, and these dogs come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. The largest dog in the world was a dog named Zorba. When Zorba, a _ , was seven years old in 1989, he was 94 centimeters (37 inches) tall. In other words, Zorba was more than half as tall as an adult man. At his largest, Zorba weighed more than a heavy weight boxer at 156 kilograms(343 pounds). In comparison, the smallest bog was a Yorkshire terrier from England. This dog was only the size of a matchbox, measuring 7.1 centimeters(2.8 inches) tall and 9.5 centimeters (3.75 inches) from nose to tail. It weighed about half as much as a common book, and even a young child could easily pick it up with one hand. It passed away in 1945 when it was only two years old. Some dogs are wonderful, not for their sizes, but for their brains. One incredible dog is Endal, the companion of a man named Allen Parton who has used a wheelchair since a car accident in 1991. In 2001, Parton was hit by a car while crossing a road with Endal, and thrown out of his chair. Endal quickly moved Parton into the recovery place, covered him with a blanket , and pushed his mobile phone close enough for him to reach. Then, once he saw that Parton was all right, Endal ran back and forth to a nearby hotel, barking until people came out to help. Endal was rewarded for his bravery by being awarded a medal, and he has been the subject of a number of TV documentaries.	['a common book']
What does this passage mainly talk about?	Chaplin was one of the famous clown-style actors of the silent time. It was through Charlie Chaplin that the Hollywood comedy movies became famous. Then in the 1920s came another trend of animated cartoons. They were the most popular Hollywood comedy movies of the time. The several popular characters of that era were Felix the cat, Krazy Kat and Betty Boop. However, the popularity of these movies was blocked out due to lack of sound and color. The end of 1920s, the Hollywood comedy industry marked a change brought about by the introduction of sound into the movies. This has allowed the industry to create dramatic new film styles and use verbal humor. These films were soon replacing silent movies. These films used dialogue of comedians such as the W.C Fields and the Marx Brothers. Charlie Chaplin was the last comedian to have acted in the silent films. When the United States entered into World War II, Hollywood movies changed its course to themes related to the conflicts, and Hollywood comedy movies described more on military themes. The war time experienced a boom, where restrictions on the traveling made nearly a quarter of the money spent on attending movies. In the 1950s, the interest shifted where the TV became popular. During this time the release of Hollywood comedy films declined . The 1960s saw an increasing number of broad, star-packed comedies. In 1970 Hollywood comedy movies reflected the anti-war sentiment, which was popular then. In the 1980s the gag based comedy Airplane was released, and Hollywood comedy movies paved its way for more of the same. The popular comedians of this time included Dudley Moore, Tom Hanks, etc. Jim Carrey, the Canadian actor and a comedian, came into Hollywood comedy movies in the late 1980s where he won the role in such a comedy, Copper Mountain. The most popular Hollywood comedy movies were of John Hughes, which includes Ferris Buellers Day Off and Home Alone series of 1990s. The later films focused more on family audience. This was a revival in comedy movies. Comedy movies remain popular till date.	['Development of Hollywood comedy movies.']
Which fathers spend more time with children?	"Today's dad spends more hours on childcare than a dad a generation ago.But he still lags behind the modem-day mom,even when her wages are equal,a new study reports.Researchers found that the number of hours a mother spent at work had no effect on the amount of time a father devoted to childcare during the week.Similarly, a mother's income had very little influence on fathers' involvement in childcare.On weekends,however,fathers spent more time with their children.Despite women's increasing role in the labor market, most mothers remain the main caregivers of young children on weekdays. Researchers found that fathers spent all average of 2.5 hours on a weekday and about 6 hours on a weekend day with their children.T _ included time spent playing together or doing schoolwork,personal care such as bathing and feeding.On weekdays, children spent one-third less time with their fathers than with their mothers,but on weekends the time gap closed and kids spent only 13% more time with their mothers than with their fathers.Children of women who made more money spent more time with their fathers on weekends, however.""The good news is that as women become equal contributing partners, the involvement of fathers does increase.""one researcher said.""The bad news is...that men still do less on traditional women's jobs--(taking care of)babies,dishes,etc."" In other findings,fathers with some college education spent 17 more minutes per weekday with their children than dads without any college education.Fathers who made more money spent less time with children on weekdays,but the amount of time was fairly small.""Our findings suggest that although mothers still shoulder most parenting,fathers' involvement to that of mothers appears to be on the increase,""the researchers conclude.""A new father' role is emerging on weekends in families."""

Barany's theory was proved incorrect in space by the effects of _ .	Experiments aboard the spaceship Columbia have disproved a theory on the human nervous system which won an Austrian professor a Nobel prize 79 years ago. West German astronaut Ulf Merbold disproved the theory during tests aboard the spaceship yesterday. His discovery is connected with the workings of the inner ear, the body's balance mechanism . In l914 Professor Robert Barany won the Nobel prize for Physiology and Medicine when he announced that temperature differences affected the inner ear and caused the eyes to blink . His theory was accepted by scientists. But Merbold carried out tests to find if the theory was correct and shocked himself and space officials when he proved it wrong. According to Barany's theory the eyes would blink when cold air was blown into one ear and hot air blown into the other. But if this theory was correct such a movement would be impossible in zero gravity . Both Merbold's eyes continually blinked when the test was carried out.	['having no weight']
Where do people usually meet their friends in England?	I fell in love with England because it was quaint --all those little houses, looking terribly old-fashioned but nice, like dolls' houses. I loved the countryside and the pubs, and I loved London. I've slightly changed my mind after seventeen years because I think it's an ugly town now. Things have changed. For everybody, England meant gentlemen, fair play, and good manners. The fair play is going, unfortunately, and so are the gentlemanly attitudes and good manners--people shut doors heavily in your face and politeness is disappearing. I regret that there are so few comfortable meeting places. You're forced to live indoors. In Paris I go out much more, to restaurants and nightclubs. To meet friends here it usually has to be in a pub, and it can be difficult to go there alone as a woman. The cafes are not terribly nice. As a woman, I feel unsafe here. I spend a bomb on taxis because I will not take public transport after 10 p. m. I used to use _ , but now I'm afraid. The idea of family seems to be more or less non-existent in England. My family is well united and that's typically French. In Middlesex I had a neighbour who is 82 now. His family only lived two miles away, but I took him to France for Christmas once because he was always alone.	['In a pub.']
Mr. Flowers had tried to _ to protect his glass.	There was once a man called Mr. Flowers, and flowers were his only joy in life. He spent all his free time in one of his four glass-houses and grew flowers of every color, with long and difficult names, for competitions. He tried to grow a rose of a new color to win the silver cup for the Rose of the Year. Mr. Flowers' glass-houses were very near to a middle school. Boys of around thirteen of age were often tempted to throw a stone or two at one of Mr. Flowers' glass-houses. So Mr. Flowers did his best to be in or near his glass-houses at the beginning and end of the school day. But it was not always possible to be on watch at those times. Mr. Flowers had tried in many ways to protect his glass, but nothing that he had done had been useful. He had been to school to report to the headmaster; but this had not done any good. He had tried to drive away the boys that threw stones into his garden; but the boys could run faster than he could, and they laughed at him from far away. He had even picked up all the stones that he could find around his garden, so that the boys would have nothing to throw; but they soon found others. At last Mr. Flowers had a good idea. He put up a large notice made of good, strong wood, some meters away from the glass-houses. On it he had written the words: DO NOT THROW STONES AT THIS NOTICE. After this, Mr. Flowers had no further trouble; the boys were much more tempted to throw stones at the notice than at the glass-houses.	['do all the above']
