Which of the following is NOT a reason why green turtles are endangered?	The green turtle is listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, the green turtle was listed as threatened except for the breeding populations in Florida and on the Pacific coast of Mexico, where it is listed as endangered. Green turtles continue to be caught for money by humans, and the destruction and loss of nesting and foraging sites is a serious problem. Humans have already caused the decrease of large green turtle populations, including those that once nested in Bermuda and Cayman Islands. The situation of green turtle populations is difficult to determine because of our lack of knowledge about their life cycles. The number of nests in Florida appears to be increasing, but we don't know whether this is due to an increase in the number of nests or because we have started to monitor nesting beaches more closely. The green turtle is the largest hardshelled sea turtle. Adults of this species commonly reach 100 cm in length and 150 kg in mass. The average size of a female nesting in Florida is 101.5 cm straight in length, with an average body mass of 136 kg. Growth rates of green turtles have not been measured under natural conditions. Green turtles grow slowly. In the southern Bahamas, green turtles grow from 30 to 75 cm in 17 years, and according to Bjorndal and Bolten, growth rates decrease with increasing length. Growth rates measured in green turtles from Florida and Puerto Rico fall within the range of growth rates measured in the southern Bahamas. Based on growth rate studies of wild green turtles, the researchers Balazs, Frazer and Ehrhart estimate the age of sexual maturity can range anywhere from 20 to 50 years.

The Star left London for _ .	"Holmes said, ""Somebody sent a letter with five pips in it from India, and arrived seven weeks later to kill John's uncle. Then they sent five pips from Scotland and arrived three days later to kill John's father. Now they have sent five pips to John from London!"" ""The letters are all from sea ports . The writer was on a ship when he wrote the letters,"" I replied. ""Very good, Watson! And John's enemy is in London already!"" ""Well, I hope they won't kill young John,"" I said. But they did. The next morning, we read in the newspaper that a policeman found him die near Waterloo station. Holmes was very angry about it. ""He came to me for help and those men murdered him! I'm going to find them, if it's the last thing I do!"" he said to me, and he hurried out of the house.

Only one ship, the Star, was in the three ports at the right times, this morning the Star left London to sail back to Georgia. I found out that the captain and two of his men, all Americans, weren't on the ship last night, so I'm sure they killed John. When they arrive in America, they'll get the pips and then the police will catch them!"""	['America']
"When saying"" more than a feel-good story"" ,the writer means that_."	Olympic medalist Dara Torres, the 41-year-old swimmer, is more than a feel-good story. Torres is as determined and driven in her daily life as she is in the pool. She is dedicated to pursuing her passions and following her dreams-something she hopes to instill in her 2-year-old daughter and women and girls everywhere. After all, her dreams took her to Beijing.

Where did Emie's kindness and caring come from?	"As a young man, Tom was a famous artist with a wife and two fine sons. One night, his older son was ill. Tom and his wife thought it was nothing serious. But the boy died suddenly that night.. After his son died, Tom always felt very sad. To make matters worse, his wife also left him later, leaving him alone with his six-year-old younger son, Emie. Sadly, he turned to alcohol for help. As time went by, Tom began to lose everything he had---his land, house, etc. A few months later, Tom passed away alone in a small bar. Hearing of Tom's death, I thought,""What a complete failure!"" But later, I began to change my earlier opinion. I knew Tom's now adult son, Emie. He is one of the kindest, most caring men. I saw the love between Emie and his children. And I thought that kindness and caring had to come from somewhere. One day, I asked him what made him become such a specia1 person. Emie said quietly, ""My father came into my room every night, give me a kiss and said,""love you, son."" Hearing his words, I understood everything. Tom didn't leave many things behind. But he had been a kind loving father, and left behind his best love."	"[""His father's love.""]"
The shopping bags containing high levels of lead _ .	"To help the environment, many Americans have made the change from paper and plastic bags to reusable grocery bags. But a report by a Florida newspaper says that reusable grocery bags sold by some supermarkets contain high levels of lead . Lead is a metal that can be harmful to humans, especially young children. Now, Senator Charles Schumer is asking the US government to investigate the use of lead in reusable shopping bags. ""When our families go to the grocery store looking for safe and healthy foods to feed their kids, the last thing they should have to worry about is poisonous bags."" Schumer said, ""A quick investigation will allow everyone to make informed, timely decisions."" Schumer added. Lead in the bags is not likely to rub off on food. But over time, paint on the bags can chip and the bags can wear out. When this happens, lead can be released . The Tampa Tribune newspaper said certain bags sold at Publix and Winn-Dixie supermarkets had lead levels that were a concern to health officials. The affected bags were found in Florida. But Publix has more than 1,000 stores in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Sough Carolina and Tennessee. Publix says that all of its bags are under current laws about lead content, but that they have asked the makers of the bags to reduce the lead levels in the product. The bags with the highest levels of lead had fancy designs and many pictures. Plain reusable bags without decoration were found to contain little lead. Consumers worried about lead levels in reusable bags can change to cloth or string bags. Paper bags are also a good choice, since paper can be recycled . Since 2007, Publix supermarkets have sold more than 13 million reusable bags. The store says because shoppers have made the change to reusable bags, it has saved more than 1 billion paper and plastics bags."	['have been reported by a newspaper']
John's mother decided to move to Chicago because _ .	"John H. Johnson was born in a black family in Arkansas city in 1918. His father died in an accident when John was six. He was reaching the high school age, but his hometown offered no high school for blacks. Fortunately he had a strong-willed caring mother. John remembered that his mother told him many times, ""Son, you can be anything you want really to be if you just believe.""She told him not to depend on others, including his mother. ""You have to earn success, ""she said. ""All the people who work hard don't succeed, but the only people who do succeed are those who work hard."" These words came from a woman with less than a third grade education. She also knew that believing and hard work don't mean everything. So she worked hard as a cook for two years to save enough to take her son, who was then 15, to Chicago. Chicago in 1933 was not the promised land that black southerners were looking for. John's mother and stepfather could not find work. But here John could go to school, and here he learned the power of words--as an editor of the newspaper and yearbook at Du Sable High School His wish was to publish a magazine for blacks. While others discouraged him, John's mother offered him more words to live by.""Nothing beats a failure but a try. ""She also let him pawn her furniture to get the $ 500 he needed to start the Negro magazine. It is natural that difficulties and failures followed John closely until he became very successful. He always keeps his mother's words in mind.""Son, failure is not in your vocabulary!"" Now John H. Johnson is one of the 400 richest people in America--worth $ 150 million."

According to the passage, the single-sex education _ .	"Research by the Institute of Education (IOE) in London found that men who went to single-sex schools were not only more likely to be separated from a partner or divorced, but also more likely to be depressed by middle age. The chances of women having successful marriages were not affected by whether they were educated in mixed or single-sex schools.Separate research by the IOE found that going without boys was beneficial for women in other ways since there was a "" statistically significant positive association between single-sex schooling and wages for women"". The study into marital success interviewed 17,000 adults who were taught in a range of schools including private boarding schools to state comprehensives.It found that single-sex education does not compromise the chances either of men or women of getting married. However, researchers found that boys educated on their own were more likely to divorce in later life.While for women, there was no significant link.The research also found men taught in boys' schools were more likely to suffer from depression by age 42--perhaps because of their increased chances of marital breakdown.But Professor Leonard's team was unable to identify why those men educated in a single-sex environment were more likely to divorce. The study asked married and _ g couples where men had attended both single-sex and mixed schools to rate how happy they were and found no marked difference in their happiness levels or willingness to share domestic chores. Mary Boust, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said the IOE research confirmed what was always suspected.""All the research shows single-sex schools are good for girls but bad for boys--both in terms of academic performance and socialization,"" she said.""Boys learn better when they are with girls and they actually learn to get on better."" The findings were presented at a conference on gender in education hosted by Perse School for Girls in Cambridge."	['may increase the risk of divorce for men in later life']
What did the author think she learn from the story?	"I have recently completed my college degree. The last project was called ""Smile"". The class was asked to go out to smile at three people and document their reactions. I am a very friendly person and always smile at everyone and say hello anyway. So, I thought this would be a piece of cake. My husband, youngest son and I went out to McDonald. We were standing in line when all of a sudden everyone around us began to back away. As I turned around I smelled a horrible body odour and saw two poor homeless men standing behind me. As I looked at the short blue-eyed gentleman closest to me, he was ""smiling"". The second man fumbled with his hands as he stood behind his friend. The young lady at the counter asked him what they wanted. He said, ""Coffee is all, Miss,"" because that was all they could afford. Then I really felt it-I embraced the little man with the blue eyes. That is when I noticed all eyes in the restaurant were set on me, judging my every action. I smiled and asked two more breakfast meals on and gave them to the men. The blue-eyed gentleman looked up at me, with tears in his eyes, and said, ""Thank you."" When I sat down my husband smiled at me. We held hands for a moment and at that time, we knew that because of the good fortune that we had been given. I turned in my project. My teacher said, ""Can I share this?"" I slowly nodded as she got the attention of the class. She began to read and that is when I knew that we as human beings share this need to heal people and to be healed. In my own way I had touched the people at McDonald's and every soul that heard the story in the classroom. But, I graduated with one of the biggest lessons I would ever learn."

Why was it hard for the American injured workers to get compensation in the early 20th century?	talent, but his contributions includes many of today's social insurance programs. During the middle German Prime Minister Otto Von Bismarck may be most famous for his military and diplomatic of the 19th century, Germany, along with other European nations, experienced an unprecedented rash of workplace deaths and accidents as a result of growing industrialization. Motivated in part by Christian sympathy for the helpless as well as a practical political impulse to get the support of the socialist labor movement, Chancellor Bismarck created the world's first workers' compensation law in 1884. By 1908, the United States was the only industrial nation in the world that lacked workers' compensation insurance. America's injured workers could sue for damages in a court of law, but they still faced a number of tough legal barriers. For example, employees had to prove that their injuries directly resulted from employer negligence and that they themselves were ignorant about potential hazards in the workplace. The first state workers' compensation law in this country passed in 1911, and the program soon spread throughout the nation. After World War II, benefit payments to American workers did not keep up with the cost of living. In fact, real benefit levels were lower in the 1970s than they were in the 1940s, and in most states the maximum benefit was below the poverty level for a family of four. In 1970, President Richard Nixon set up a national commission to study the problems of workers' compensation. Two years later, the commission issued 19 key recommendations, including one that called for increasing compensation benefit levels to 100 percent of the states' average weekly wages. In fact, the average compensation benefit in America has climbed from 55 percent of the states' average weekly wages in 1972 to 97 percent today. But, as most studies show, every 10 percent increase in compensation benefits results in a 5 per cent increase in the numbers of workers who file for claims. And with so much more money floating in the workers' compensation system, it's not surprising that doctors and lawyers have helped themselves to a large slice of the growing pie.

Where can you most probably find this passage?	Every living thing on Earth is either a plant or an animal, right? Wrong! Many organisms in our world are neither. Some of them float through the air, and some lie hidden in the ground. They do not need sunlight to survive, and if the weather becomes too cold, they can become inactive until conditions improve. What are these? They are called fungi , and you see them almost every day. Many kinds of fungi seem _ , such as the green black things that appear on the food which are left too long in the refrigerator. But other kinds are not so bad. For example, the yeast that is used to make bread and mushrooms are both fungi. What makes fungi different from plants and animals? An animal can move around by itself. Fungi get around too, but they don't have feet, wings, or tails. They have to wait for wind or some other outside force to move them. Plants are different from fungi because they have chlorophyll . It helps them make food from the energy in sunlight. Fungi do not have chlorophyll. Some fungi are bad, while others are not. Some fungi cause diseases, such as athlete's foot, which makes feet uncomfortable. Other kinds of fungi can be used to make medicines, which have saved many lives. Fungi clean up more than wounds, though. They are the world's first recyclers. Without fungi, our world would be a mess. Since fungi cannot make their own food as plants do, they must get their food elsewhere. Many fungi get their food from dead plants. They break them down and turn them into soil. The fungi get a meal, and the world gets a housecleaning.	['In a biology book.']
We can infer from the passage that in Australia _ .	In less than 60 years the people of my tribe have gone from being an independent nation, to cultural prisoners, to welfare recipients . Is it any wonder that there are so many problems facing indigenous Australians today? When I was growing up in Kowanyama there were 15 people in my class, I am the only one who has gone to university. I'm also the only girl in my class who did not have a child at 15. Of the boys in my class, seven have been incarcerated, two for murder, five for robbery and rape. Only three of us are not alcoholics. Four of my classmates have committed suicide. Life as a young aborigine is not easy, in any setting. The story of my fellow students is a lesson in the magnitude of the problems that young indigenous people in Cape York face. The two issues that are central to changing this story are education and health. There is a huge gap between what we get in communities and what other kids get in cities. One of the problems facing education in remote indigenous schools is that teachers tend to be just out of training and stay for only a year or two. Not one teacher stayed for the whole of my nine years at school--not even the principals. This seeming lack of commitment makes you feel they don't care. We need to review the curriculum in these communities because it is pitched at a very low level. I have had to draw the conclusion that governments and educationalists see us as less than white people. Education should be uplifting, not serve to reinforce lack of self-esteem and the heart-wrenching low expectations that our race suffer from. We need a massive reassessment of,education policies and an equally massive investment in education. We have spent so long listening to some white fellows telling us we are stupid, lazy no-hopers that the majority of my people actually believe it. The relationship between poor education and poor health is clear. People whose self-esteem and pride have been destroyed by a substandard education system and a social system that creates an addiction to passive welfare have little reason to live healthy lives. Our health is getting worse. The policies that determine the delivery of health services are deeply flawed by a bureaucracy that does not want to hear our voices. Health services are often confined to the clinic. It is problems and challenges such as these that led me to stand in last October's ATSIC election. ATSITC is more than the board of commissioners and the Canberra bureaucracy. ATSIC is also people who are from community and work hard for community. We recognize that governments cannot solve our problems for us. As young people we are trying to take responsibility for our future. I ask the Prime Minister, not that he fixes these problems for us but that he and his Government see us as equal partners in the huge task of rebuilding our families, communities and Cape York Peninsula. He demonstrated his commitment by engaging his Government at the family and domestic violence summit. My view is that the level of domestic violence and child abuse sums up all that has been wrong with Aboriginal policy. .We need a new relationship to address this frightening reality in our lives. Aboriginal people are reluctant to admit that young girls and women are being raped by their own people because of the blanket of shame. * I am asking you to help lift that blanket. I stand here as a proud Aboriginal woman, a Kokoberra woman as well as a criminologist, and I thank you for your time and attention. Tania Major, 22, is an ATSIC regional councilor and a trainee manager at her home community of Kowanyama on Cape York. This is an edited version of an address she is scheduled to give at a meeting between the Prime Minister and Cape York leaders (full text at smh. com. an).

According to the passage, the author thought _ .	"I had my first job at a local diner called the Buttercup Bakery when I was 22. I worked there for seven years and learned so many lessons, especially from a fellow waitress Helen who had incredible self-respect and did what she loved--serving people. She made everyone smile and feel good, customers and co-workers alike. Being a waitress changed my life. One of my regular customers was Fred Hasbrook, an electronics salesman. Thanks to the newfound confidence I picked up from Helen, I dreamed of having my own restaurant. But when I called my parents to ask for a loan, they said, ""We just don't have the money."" The next day, I shared my dream with him and said, ""Fred, I know I can do more if somebody would just have faith in me."" He walked over to some of the other diner regulars and the next day handed me checks totaling $50,000--along with a note that I have to this day. It reads, ""The only collateral on this loan is my trust in your honesty as a person. Good people with a dream should have the opportunity to make that dream come true."" I took the checks to Merrill Lynch--the first time I had ever entered a brokerage house--where the money was invested for me. I continued working at the Buttercup, making plans for the restaurant I would open. My investments soured, though, and I lost the money. After great deliberation I decided to apply for a job at Merrill Lynch. Even though I had no experience, I was hired and ended up becoming a pretty good broker. Eventually I paid back Fred and my customers the $50,000, plus 14-percent annual interest. Five years later, I was able to open my own firm. I got a thank-you note from Fred, which will be imprinted on my head forever. He had been sick and wrote that my check had helped cover his mounting medical bills. His letter read, ""That loan may have been one of the best investments that I will ever make."""	['she was lucky to have a job working with Helen']

Mrs. Smith treated her little dog quite _ .	"It was Monday. Mrs. Smith's dog was hungry , but there was not any meat in the house. Considering that there was no better way. Mrs. Smith took a piece of paper, and wrote the following words on it:""Give my dog half a pound of meat.""Then she gave the paper to her dog and said gently:""Take this to the butcher(* person whose job is selling meat)and he's going to give you your lunch today."" Holding the piece of paper in its mouth, the dog ran to the butcher's. It gave the paper to the butcher. The butcher read it carefully, recognized that it was really the lady's handwriting and soon did it as he was asked to. The dog was very happy, and ate the meat up at once. At noon, the dog came to the shop again. It gave the butcher a piece of paper again. After reading it, he gave it half a pound of meat once more. The next day, the dog came again exactly at noon. And as usual, it brought a piece of paper in the mouth. This time, the butcher did not take a look at paper, and gave the dog its meat, for he had regarded the dog as one of his customers. But, the dog came again at four o'clock. And the same thing happened once again. To the butcher's more surprise, it came for the third time at six o'clock, and brought with it a third piece of paper. The butcher felt a bit puzzled . He said to himeself,""This is a small dog. Why does Mrs. Smith give it so much meat to eat today?""

Which of the following is the best title for the passage?	"It appears that the police now have a device that can read license plates and check if a car is unregistered, uninsured or stolen. We already know that National Security Agency can dip into your Facebook page and Google searches. And it seems that almost every store we go into these days wants your home phone number and ZIP code as part of any deal. So when Edward Snowden -- now cooling his heels in Russia -- revealed the extent to which the NSA is spying on Americans, collecting data on phone calls we make, it's not as if we should have been surprised. We live in a world that George Orwell predicted in 1984. And that realization has caused sales of the 1949, dystopian novel to spike dramatically upward recently -- a 9,000% increase at one point on Amazon. com. Comparisons between Orwell's novel about a tightly controlled totalitarian future ruled by the everywhere-present Big Brother and today are, in fact, quite similar. Here are a few of the most obvious ones. Telescreens -- in the novel, nearly all public and private places have large TV screens that broadcast government propaganda , news and approved entertainment. But they are also two-way monitors that spy on citizens, private lives. Today websites like Facebook track our likes and dislikes, and governments and private individuals hack into our computers and find out what they want to know. Then there are the ever-present monitoring cameras that spy on the ordinary people as they go about their daily routine. The endless war -- In Orwell's book, there's global war that has been going on seemingly forever, and as the book's hero, Winston Smith, realizes the enemy keeps changing. One week we're at war with Eastasia and friends with Eurasia. The next week, it's just the opposite. There seems little to distinguish the two opponents, and they are used primarily to keep the people of Oceania, where Smith lives, in a constant state of fear, thereby making disagreement unthinkable -- or punishable. Today we have the so-called war on terror, with no end in sight, a generalized societal fear, suspensionof certain civil liberties, and an ill-defined enemy who could be anywhere, and anything. Newspeak -- the fictional, stripped-down English language, used to limit free thought. OMG (Oh my God), RU (Are you) serious? That's so FUBAR (Fucked Beyond Ail Recognition). LMAO (Laugh My Ass Off). Memory hole -- this is the machine used in the book to change or disappear embarrassing documents. Paper shredders had been invented, but were hardly used when Orwell wrote his book, and the concept of wiping out a hard drive was years in the future. But the memory hole foretold both technologies. So what's it all meant? In 1984, Winston Smith, after an intense round of ""behavioral modification"" -- read: torture-- learns to love Big Brother, and the difficult world he was born into. Jump forward to today, it seems we've willingly given up all sorts of freedoms, and much of our right to privacy. Fears of terrorism have a lot to do with this, but dizzying advances in technology, and the ubiquity of social media, play a big part. There are those who say that if you don't have anything to hide, you have nothing to be afraid of. But the fact is, when a government agency can monitor everyone's phone calls, we have all become suspects. This is one of the most frightening aspects of our modem society. _ Unless you spend your life in a wilderness cabin, totally off the grid, there is simply no way the government won't have information about you stored away somewhere. What this means, unfortunately, is that we are all Winston Smith. And Big Brother is the modem surveillance state."	"['We\'re living ""1984"" today.']"

What is the best title for this passage?	I come from a city on the United States'east coast. It's a ten-hour flight for me to get home from Shanghai. When I got off the plane, I took photos of the blue sky and white clouds along the way. After two weeks, I returned to Shanghai. Much to my surprise, the blue sky in Shanghai that I liked before was not as blue as that in the US. I couldn't help wondering what had happened. A few days later, I went to tour Waitan (a famous tourist attraction in Shanghai) by the Huangpu River with some of my friends. There we saw five Ferrari sports cars by the side of the road. The red and yellow cars looked so nice that everyone was looking at them. However, when I turned my head, I noticed the sky over Waitan, I was shocked to find that the buildings in the Lujiazui area on the other side of Huangpu River could hardly be seen. It was then that I realized that Ferrari cars could be bought with money, but a blue sky couldn't. Shanghai is an important economic and trade center in China. It has made great contributions to the whole nation's economic development. However, we need to protect the environment during economic growth. Pollution is poisoning our air and our rivers. Without clean air and rivers, how will people be able to survive?	['Money Can Buy Ferraris, But Not a Blue Sky']
What's the purpose of the author in writing this passage?	The Internet can provide a wealth of educational resources for small children, if you know where to look. This article will offer some educational websites to small children. You may need to assist your children in navigating the pages until they understand where their favorite activities are. Enchanted Learning Enchanted learning is a great website for children, and I know several teachers who rely on it for materials for their classrooms. Most of the information is free, but for $20.00 per year, you can purchase a membership that allows you to have access to the site without the advertising. The pages here are great. There are colored pages and worksheets for toddlers and school-age children. They focus on learning language, science, animals, geography, astronomy, explorers, music, art and nursery rhymes. Starfall Starfall is another good educational website for small children. Teachers often use this website in classrooms. It emphasizes reading skills for early learners. The website is aimed at first grade level learners, but it has tools that can help all children from pre-K to second grade. The website has reading activities, worksheets to download, and a store where you can purchase educational materials for your children. Sesame Street Workshop Kids love Sesame Street, and it is always educational. This is one of the funniest websites online for children because it is very well animated and has great sound effects. The website has games and stories for small kids, and they can create letters at the post office and mail them to their favorite characters. Sprout Online Sprout has features on its television network, which are just for children. There are games, colored pages, recipes, music, videos, sign language activities and exercise videos for children. There are also online activities based on Sprout television shows. These include Roary the Race Car, the Wiggles, the Mighty Jungle and many others. These are just a few of many educational websites for children. Small children love to use computers, so help them find some websites that contain fun and learning at the same time.	['To introduce some educational websites to parents for their kids.']

From Kaixin's words, we can guess that he is probably a _ .	"Recently, Chinese netizens enjoy themselves on ""growing and stealing crops"" on the Internet. This is a game called ""Happy Farms"". Now more and more people are joining in the game, and getting addicted. Some of them are even found playing the game at work. Because of this, some players have been fired by their bosses. Lovers have broken up, but none of them can stop Happy Farms from becoming more popular. Here we interviewed some young netizens and let's see what their opinions were. Nongmin: Playing happy Farms at work, that's terrible! A clerk was fired because she was online playing it at work. King: I find that all the dreams of having houses and fields, which are very hard to get in real life, are very easy to be realized in the games. I think I know the reason why the game is so popular. Kaixin: We have to know how to control ourselves. We should keep our minds on study. Games are just games. I prefer to play sports with my classmates when I am free. Kitty: I like Happy Farms. My high-pressure work makes me feel like I can't breathe. I wish I could have a real house and farm, but it seems so far away. I have to turn to virtual nature for my own house and farm. People often get tired from work or study, so they go to their own farms, take care of their crops and pull out weeds. It is really delightful to forget about the pressure. But some players work from morning to night to ""grow and steal crops"". They lose themselves in the game and show no interest in anything else. It is really terrible."	['student']
Doctors started setting up home in Harley Street probably because _ .	Savile Row was first developed in 1695 as part of the Burlington Estate. It had been part of the gardens of Burlington House previous to this. Originally it was named Savile Street. Houses were built on one side of the street, with gardens on the other side and was therefore nicknamed Savile Row, with a row of houses on one side. The name was officially changed in 1810. The first tailors appear on the street in 1785, and over the next fifty years the trend continued. This is what made the area famous. Many Savile Row Tailors have gone out of business or moved elsewhere within London,bottes ugg, but plenty still remain and it is still the place many men go for their tailoring. Fleet Street is synonymous with the British Press. The street runs from the east end of the Strand through to Farringdon Street. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century the trend for printers and publishers moving into the area began. Later, and more famously, newspapers started to move their offices to Fleet Street. The first daily newspaper to do this was the Daily Courant in the early 1700's. By the 20th century a large majority of London and National newspapers had their headquarters in the area. This is no longer the case though, as many of the papers moved out of Fleet Street from the 1980's. All of the main newspapers have now left and it is now more associated with law practices . Harley Street is world famous for its medical practices. Prior to the 18th century it only consisted of a few houses and was part of the village of Marylebone; not yet part of the City of London. As London grew in the 1700's century Marylebone became part of London. It was developed into a larger residential area between 1715 and 1720. Around a century later doctors started setting up home in the area, with a number of them setting up practices from then homes. As this trend continued the area became well known in this aspect.

What is the best tittle for the passage?	"Do you think Great Britain and the United States are alike? Winston Churchill once joked that the people of Britain and the people of America are separated only by their language. Do you think that is true? The British and the Americans both speak English as the official language. However, each uses some different words.We Americans are similar to the British. After all , our country was once owned by Great Britain , so we have a lot in common. But there are many differences between us. Great Britain has a king or queen, and the leader of the government is the Prime Minister. The United States has no kings or queens. Our leader is the President. Both the British and Americans use pounds and ounces, oints, quarts, and gallons. Both use miles, yards,and feet. Our money is different,though. The British use pounds and pence. Americans use dollars and cents. Driving in a car is very different in England. They drive on the left side of the road. We drive on the right. What we call the hood of the car, the British call the ""bonnet"". British cars run on ""petrol"",which we call gasoline. In our everyday lives, we do many of the same things as the British. But we describe them differently. A young mother here might push a baby in a baby carriage. A British mom pushes a ""pram"". The British watch the ""telly"", while we watch TV. We like to eat French fries, but the British call them ""chips"". Millions of Americans drink coffee, but most British prefer tea. So we are different in many ways. But we stay friendly anyway."

What would be the best title for the passage?	There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before. We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood. Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time. The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully. The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer. The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray.	['Early discovery of cancer']
What is the special infill used to do?	Breakthroughs in science and technology are paving the way for modern cities to support bigger populations. Now, we see the most exciting urban innovations to show you exactly how they'll improve your city's infrastructure . Lighting Up The Night Anthony Di Mari dreamed up an electric tree to help irrigate public parks and light them at night. These electric trees contain a special infill that collects water from rainfall. The water is then distributed through a shallow underground irrigation system with the help from the trees' swaying movement. An electric motor turns energy from the waving of the artificial trees into electricity, which is used to light up the trees' outer LEDs. Thinking Outside The Box As more people flock to urban areas, city planners will need to get increasingly creative about how to satisfy residents' health and transportation needs within decreasing available space. One way to achieve this is by updating infrastructure to support biking and walking by building suspended roundabouts like hovering in the Netherlands. By lifting bicycle and pedestrian traffic above busy roadways, cities can significantly decrease over-crowded traffic condition. Waving Hello To Clean Energy Cities that don't receive enough sunlight may find an attractive alternative in wave power. Since ocean waves rarely experience disruption , electric engines driven by their clockwork push-and-pull can reliably provide power throughout the year. Further, thanks to advances in wave power technology, engineers have been able to move wave power engines farther offshore, where the waves pack the most punch, making the engines extremely efficient. So in the future, heavily populated coastal cities may use wave to meet their energy needs.	['To collect water from rainfall.']
If the author wanted to make a trip to Hawaii, he might _ this year.	We're trying to decide where to go on our vacation this summer. We usually go to the Lake Arrowhead for a few weeks, but we'd like to go somewhere else this year. We're tired of doing the same thing summer after summer. Some friends of ours suggested that we go to Hawaii. That would be wonderful! I'm sure we'd enjoy a trip like that, but of course _ . In the first place, it would be rather expensive, and in the second place, there wouldn't be enough time. If we're lucky enough to save some money between now and next summer, and if I'm lucky enough to get four weeks of vacation instead of two weeks, maybe we can go to Hawaii next year. As a matter of fact, if we wanted to plan a trip like that, it might be advisable to stay home this summer and not go any place. That's one way we could begin to save some money for next year's trip. Also, if we were to stay here, I could offer to work instead of taking two weeks off; then maybe my boss would suggest that I be given four weeks' vacation next summer instead of two weeks.

Give the best title for this passage.	Believe it or not, if you do not use your arms or your legs for a long time, they become weak. When you start using them again, they slowly become strong again. Everybody knows that. Yet many people do not seem to know that memory works in the same way. When someone says that he has a good memory, he really means that he keeps his memory in practice by using it. When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he does not give it enough chance to become strong. If a friend says that his arms and legs are weak, we know that it is his fault. But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think that his parents are to blame, and few of us know that it is just his own fault. Have you ever found that some people can't read or write but they have better memories? This is because they cannot read or write and they have to remember things; they cannot write them down in a little notebook. They have to remember days, names, songs and stories; so their memory is the whole time being exercised.	['How to Have a Good Memory']
According to the passage, the researchers may agree the best way to influence behavior is _ .	Two recent studies have found that punishment is not the best way to influence behavior. One showed that adults are much more cooperative if they work in a system based on rewards. Researchers at Harvard University in the United States and the Stockholm School of Economics in Sweden did the study. They had about two hundred college students play a version of the game known as the Prisoner's Dilemma. The game is based on the tension between the interests of an individual and a group. The students played in groups of four. Each player could win points for the group, so they would all gain equally. But each player could also reward or punish each of the other three players, at a cost to the punisher. Harvard researcher David Rand says the most successful behavior proved to be cooperation. The groups that rewarded it the most earned about twice as much in the game as the groups that rewarded it the least. And the more a group punished itself, the lower its earnings were. The group with the most punishment earned twenty-five percent less than the group with the least punishment. The study appeared last month in the journal Science. The other study involved children. It was presented last month in California at a conference on violence and abuse. Researchers used intelligence tests given to two groups. More than eight hundred children aged two to four the first time they were tested. More than seven hundred children aged five to nine. The two groups were retested four years later, and the study compared the results with the first test. Both groups contained children whose parents used physical punishment and children whose parents did not. The study says the IQs--or intelligence quotients--of the younger children who were not _ were five points higher than those who were. In the older group, the difference was almost three points. Murray Strauss from the University of New Hampshire worked with Mallie Paschall from the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation. Professor Strauss has written extensively about physical punishment of children. He says the more they are spanked, the slower their mental development. He also looked at average IQs in other nations and found them lower where spanking was more common.	['rewarding good behavior']
During the travel, _ impressed the kids as well as the parents most.	"Many families take their children on vacation. They will usually travel for a few days or weeks during school breaks. But Julie and Tim Rivenbark planned a longer vacation with their two children--the Rivenbark family is on a one-year trip around the world. They plan to visit 30 countries in all. Right now, the four travellers are about halfway through their trip. Ms. Rivenbark says they are trying to see as much of the world as they can. She says ""we have been through Europe, southern Africa, now we are kind of working our way through Asia. So we have been to a bunch of big cities, like Dubai, Johannesburg, Rome and Bangkok."" The family has also spent time floating in kayaks(long narrow boats) in Italy, flying in hot air balloons in Myanmar, hiking to the Everest Base Camp in Nepal and going on a journey to see or hunt animals in South Africa. Mr. Rivenbark says the family has also ridden on ostrich birds, elephants, and camels. But, he says, one of the most interesting experiences of the trip has been meeting new people. ""People have been extremely friendly, very welcoming and love our kids--interacting with them and their reaction to see our kids enjoying themselves in their country."" Eleven-year old Tyler says he has enjoyed learning about the people they have met. ""I learned in Africa that people have very different lifestyles compared to Americans."" His sister, 9-year-old Kara, discovered that she liked Thai food. Ms. Rivenbark says that the extended trip teaches the children a lot more than short visits would have. ""I think that the longer we travel, the more impact it has on how they see the world. I can see them changing more than they can see themselves."" It took the family a year to prepare for the trip. They had to sell their house and cars. Ms. Rivenbark quit her job and her husband is using unpaid leave. They carry small bags filled with lightweight clothing and whatever else they need. Ms. Rivenbark says she enjoys being able to carry everything she needs on her back. She says she does not miss the things she has back home. ""What has become more important is making these memories as a family and taking those with us instead."" Tyler and Kara each have iPads so they can communicate with teachers to stay current with their schoolwork. Tyler is also creating a 365-day video blog. The Rivenbarks will continue to head east for the next six months. They plan to visit Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China and Australia.

The writer's purpose of writing this article is to _ .	"Looking up at the ceiling, Na He Jeon pours porridge into her mouth. She carefully dips the bowl forward, dropping the porridge directly down her throat, careful not to touch the 15 ulcers in her mouth. But it was the week before midterms, so she still had to study. Jeon was 1st out of 330 students on her exams that year. ""Thank god I did,"" she says. ""If I hadn't done well I would have been regarded as a failure."" By the end of the week, 14-year-old Jeon weighed only 83.6 pounds. Like Jeon, there are countless numbers of first generation Asian-Americans who make great efforts to go beyond at everything. Yet the children themselves cannot all be put to blame for their efforts. Typically, it is the parents who are designing a life which they see as perfect for their children. One such occurrence is when I was at my hotel in Beijing. It was roughly around 8:00 p.m. when I decided to take a dip in the pool after dinner. I jumped into the pool that was already spotted with a few Chinese children and I hadn't realized what was going on until I took notice of the parents calling out orders and instructing their children. I saw various children all under the age of 10 taking laps across the pool trying various styles. If a child's foot was too bent, her parent would demand that she straighten it. If a child was kicking too slowly, his parent would order that he go faster. I couldn't help but pity the children whose parents were taking the opportunity to give a swimming lesson, rather than just let them enjoy their time during the holiday. Either because of their parents or their own desire, first-generation Asian-Americans put forth their 110% in order to be accepted into one of the best American colleges. Asian-American students want to see A's, 100%'s, and perfect scores. According to Jeon, Asians complain that students with a 4.0 GPA and 2400 SAT simply cannot be rejected from top schools. To their disappointment, however, they often are. The ethic of this aggressive work also exhibits itself via sports and other after-class activities. What sets Asian-Americans apart, however, is that they fight to be excellent in whatever it is that they do. Be it playing the piano or performing in math competitions, Asian-Americans look to be in first place. Although it may cause unnecessary stress, such a driven work ethic is a _ quality. Often blamed for lacking in creativity, Asian-Americans can actually make up for the absence of imagination with their determination. The average American can dream creative dreams, but that only matters if he or she can make it happen in reality. Asian-Americans, instead, can gather creative ideas to produce something concrete. Yet with such a drive to succeed, Asian-Americans have somehow twisted their definition of success. Rather than looking at personal achievement, they refer to numbers, statistics and scores to rate their success. It seems as if desire and the sense of free will are nonexistent in certain Asian-American students as they mercilessly drive themselves to an inevitable burnout. Their desire to be the most-talented is an impossible dream. In a fruitless attempt, they try to be the best in a world already full of winners."

We can infer from the text that when crossing the Lolo Pass the author _ .	"Grey clouds move as low as smoke over the treetops at Lolo Pass. The ground is white. The day is June 10.It has been snowing for the past four days in the Bitterroot Mountains.Wayne Fairchild is getting worried about our trek over the Lolo Trail-95 miles from Lolo Montana to Weippe in Idaho, across the roughest country in the West. Lewis and Clark were nearly defeated 200 years ago by snowstorms on the Lolo.Today Fairchild is nervously checking the weather reports.He has agreed to take me across the toughest,middle section of the trail. When Lewis climbed on top of Lemhi Pass,140 miles south of Missoula,on Aug.12,1805,he was astonished by what was in front of him;""high mountain chains still to the West of us with their tops partially covered with snow.""Nobody in what was then the US knew the Rocky Mountains existed,with peaks twice as high as anything in the Appalachians back East. Today their pathway through those mountains holds more attraction than any other ground over which they traveled,for its raw wilderness is an evidence to the character of two cultures:the explorers who braved its hardships and the Native Americans who prize and conserve the path as a sacred gift. It remains today the same condition as when Lewis and Clark walked it. The Lolo is passable only from July to mid-September.Our luck is holding with the weather,although the snow keeps getting deeper.As we climb to Indian Post Office,the highest point on the trail at 7,033 ft,we have covered 13 miles in soft snow,and we hardly have enough energy to make dinner.After a meal of chicken,I sit on a rock on top of the ridge .There is no light visible in any direction,not even another campfire.For four days we do not see another human being.We are occupied with the things that mix fear with joy.In our imagination we have finally caught up with Lewis and Clark."

What can be inferred from the passage?	"Several dollars equal nothing for some people, but make a difference for others. Steve has just lost his wife to cancer and everything they had is gone due to the treatment. He now lives in the shelter for the homeless. So we know each other. Just like other homeless people, he didn't think he needed anything. But once he mentioned to me he needed eye glasses. His voice hesitated a bit, he looked down, and it appeared like he thought such a request was just a dream. Too much to hope for? It was as if his wish were known by me only. I submitted an application for him to a program that is supposed to provide a free eye examination and glasses. Three months later, I phoned to ask what was up with the appointment but they told me there was a cash flow problem until late summer. Steve showed disappointment, thanked me and started to walk away. I said, ""Hold on, I will figure out a way to get you an eye examination and glasses."" His face lit up a tiny bit. He had seen some of the things I have done for other people in our shelter and to me it looked like he might have a line of hope. I took a picture of him and posted his picture and his story in the Twitter. In about 4 days, eight people from around the world donated $25 each and one person donated $40 and I made up the rest to get him an eye exam and glasses. Steve picked up his glasses on Wednesday: May 11th, 2011. Today Steve has returned to a previous job he had in a nearby car wash. Because he now has glasses he will be able to see what he is doing while cleaning the vehicles. He is starting a second job at a pet center next week!"

Which of the following words can best decribe the author's father?	"On Sundays my father always wore that dull gray apron - the one with the race cars all over it. The ritual began after breakfast when Dad always announced: ""Go ahead everyone. I'll take care of the dishes!"" With that my mother disappeared into the folds of the Sunday paper. Off came the suit coat he had worn to church that morning. Up went the shirtsleeves. On went that apron. For the next hour Dad did the dishes, singing ballads like ""I Had a Hat When I Came In"" and ""Who Put the Chow in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?"" I suppose it was strange for a boy's father to wear an apron - even one with race cars - but I never thought much of it until the day that Dad broke with tradition. It was the last Sunday in August. My father seemed in an expansive mood as we walked home from church together. ""Tommy,"" he said letting my name roll off his tongue. My mind raced ahead of his words: The birds and the bees? A new bike? A part-time job? ""There comes a time in every boy's life when he must take on responsibilities."" This was important. I might even get to back the car out of the driveway. ""Responsibilities?"" I asked. ""Yes. It's time you took a greater role in the household."" Power tools? Boss my baby brother? ""Starting today, I want you to do the dishes on Sunday morning so your mother and I can work the crossword puzzle together."" ""The dishes!?"" ""Anything wrong with taking over the dishes, son?"" I started to say something about a man's job or woman's work, but I knew immediately that my protests would fall on deaf ears. I didn't taste a bit of breakfast that morning. Dad seemed in a jovial mood as he described an exceptional Yankee game seen through the eyes of Mel Allen on the radio last night. ""Mickey Mantle drove the ball right over the center field wall,"" he said. ""Just a straight line climb in right out of the stadium."" He looked out the window as if trying to pick the ball out of the cloud formations. I tried to imagine Mickey Mantle wearing an apron. Suddenly, everything grew quiet. My sister began to clear the table. My brother was scraping the last of the egg from his plate. And then that ancient family ritual that had filled so many Sunday mornings came to an end. My father announced: ""Let's go read the paper, Hon."" ""Aren't you doing the dishes?"" my mother asked in puzzlement. ""Your oldest son has generously offered to fill the position."" My brother and sister stopped cold. So this was what my life had come to. A dark angel sat on my left shoulder and reminded me that I could hit a baseball farther than anyone in my class. I could bench-press my weight. I knew three declensions in Latin, the language of Caesar. Ask me to run through a rainstorm. Command me to ride the roller coaster - backward. These things I would do. But I could never do those dishes. There was nothing left but to refuse. People often say there is a special chemistry between a father and a son. He came back into the kitchen just as I was about to storm out. He had loosened his tie and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt - ready to relax. In his right hand was the old apron. ""I want you to have this, Tommy. It'll keep your clothes from getting wet."" And before I could mount a protest, he had put the thing on me. ""Thanks, Son. Your mother and I appreciate this.""

What is the passage mainly about?	"Air pollution is one of the hottest topics at present because poor air quality is an important factor in both the incidence and cause of respiratory diseases. Zhong Nanshan, a deputy to the NPC and a member of the CAE, said recently when the concentration of PM2.5 rises by 10 micrograms per cubic meter, hospitalization may rise by as much as 3.1 percent. Meanwhile, when the concentration of PM2.5 rises from 25 mgs per cubic meter to 200, the average daily death rate may rise to 11 percent. Zhi Xiuyi, a leading expert in lung cancer treatment and also vice-president of the CATS, said medical authorities used to focus on tobacco control as a primary means of preventing lung cancer. ""But in fact, air pollution is no less harmful than smoking and our research team released a report earlier this year showing that the cancer rate in Beijing is closely related to industrialization,"" he said. The report, conducted by the Beijing Institute of Cancer Research, shows that the number of cancer patients in China has increased markedly during the past ten years. Chaoyang District, the city's main area of industrialization, has the highest incidence of cancer, almost double that of Yanqing, an area on the outskirts of the city. About four out of 1000 Chaoyang residents have some form of the disease, with lung cancer at the top of the list. ""The risk of having cancer largely depends on the length of exposure and the concentration of noxious gases ,"" said Zhi. In response to the doubt whether seven years' exposure to poor air quality will almost result in cancer, Zhi said the time scale was taken from research overseas that suggested the rate of incidence generally peaked in the seventh year of exposure to a heavily polluted environment."

Keesh showed his courage at the council meeting by _ .	"Keesh lived at the North Pole a long time ago. He lived near the edge of the polar sea. He was a bright thirteen-year-old boy with a strong, healthy body. His father was a brave man who had died during a food shortage in the village. His father tried to save the lives of his people by fighting a giant polar bear. Keesh's father was crushed to death during the struggle. But he killed the bear, and the meat from the bear kept the people from starving. Keesh was his only son, and he lived alone with his mother. But people are forgetful, and they soon forgot how Keesh's father had saved their lives. And since Keesh was only a boy and his mother was a woman and not a warrior , they were forced to live in the smallest and poorest igloo in the village. One night there was a council meeting in the large igloo of Klosh-Kwan, who was the chief. At that meeting Keesh showed how much courage he possessed. He rose to his feet and waited for silence. Then, with the dignity of an older man, he said, "" It is true that my mother and I are given meat to eat. But the meat is always old and tough, filled with bones, and difficult to eat."" The hunters--both the young and the old--were shocked to hear a child speak to them that way. But Keesh went on steadily, ""Because my father, Bok, was a great hunter, I can speak these words. You know that Bok brought home more meat than any hunter in the village. The oldest woman, the weakest old man, received a fair share."" Keesh waited calmly until the shouting died down. ""My mother has no one except me, and therefore I must speak. My father put his life in danger and died, to provide food for this village. It is only right that I, his son and his wife should have enough good meat as long as there is plenty of good meat in this village. I, Keesh, the son of Bok, have spoken."" He sat down. He could hear angry murmuring all around him. Some men began to shout at Keesh. They ordered him to leave. They threatened to punish him by not giving him any food at all. Keesh's eyes flashed and the blood pounded under his skin. In the midst of the noise and the uproar, he jumped to his feet. ""Listen to me, you men!"" he shouted. ""I shall never speak in this council again--not until you come to invite me to speak. My father was a great hunter, and so will I be."" They laughed at Keesh and followed him out of the igloo, shouting at him. But Keesh said nothing more. He walked away with his head raised, looking neither to the left nor the right.... ---Based on a story by Jack London"	['complaining of the unfair treatment he and his mother received']
What might be the best title for the text?	Most people who experience bad service while traveling, shopping, or dining out do no complain. They accept bad services or products without making a sound. Why? Many feel complaining won't do any good. In fact, they're wrong, because companies don't want their customers unhappy. Not sure you can do it? Here are some ways to use when things go wrong. 1.If you have a complaint, do something about it right away. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to get your complaint solved. 2.First, complain to the servers. If they are not going to solve your problem, then ask politely to speak to a manager. And if that doesn't work, you can always request to speak to the manager's manager! 3.Demand a discount . Let's say you were promised a hotel room with an ocean view, but got a view of a brick wall instead; if you were promised a seat in the front of a plane, but got a seat in the back. You should do something about both of these situations. Ask a special discount. 4.Don't be passive. Offer ways you think the company can satisfy you. 5.Insist on the price you were told. If you are refused, get a manager's name and telephone number, and promise to follow up with a letter and a telephone call. 6.If all else fails, wait until you get home and take action. Call the company's head office, and speak to the most powerful person possible. Then follow up your call with a letter of complaint. If necessary, call the customer protection office in your city and complain.	['Get what you should get']

What is implied about the example of a bird's sleeping in front of a mirror?	"Birds that are half-asleep -- with one brain hemisphere alert and the other sleeping -- control which side of the brain remains awake, according to a new study of sleeping ducks. Earlier studies have recorded half-brain sleep in a wide range of birds. The brain hemispheres take turns sinking into the sleep stage characterized by slow brain waves. The eye controlled by the sleeping hemisphere keeps shut, while the wakeful hemisphere's eye stays open and alert. Birds also can sleep with both hemispheres resting at once. Decades of studies of bird groups led researchers to predict extra alertness in the end-of-the-row sleepers which tend to be attacked more easily. Sure enough, the end birds tended to watch carefully on the side away from their companions. Ducks in the inner spots showed no preference for gaze direction. Also, birds napping at the end of the line depend on single-hemisphere sleep, rather than total relaxation, more often than inner ducks did. Turning 16 birds through the positions in a four-duck row, the researchers found that compared with 12 percent for birds in inner spots, outer birds half-asleep during some 32 percent of napping time. ""We believe this is the first evidence for an animal behaviorally controlling sleep and wakefulness at the same time in different regions of the brain,"" the researchers say. The results provide the best evidence for a long-standing assumption that single-hemisphere sleep developed over time as creatures scanned for enemies. The preference for opening an eye on the lookout side could be widespread, he predicts. He's seen it in a pair of birds napping side-by-side in the zoo and in a single pet bird sleeping by a mirror. The mirror-side eye closed as if the reflection were a companion and the other eye stayed open. Useful as half-sleeping might be, it's only been found in birds and such water animals as dolphins, whales, and seals. Perhaps keeping one side of the brain awake allows a sleeping animal to surface occasionally to avoid drowning. Studies of birds may offer unique insights into sleep. Jerome M. Siegel of the UCLA says he wonders if birds' half-brain sleep ""is just the tip of the iceberg."" He supposes that more examples may turn up when we take a closer look at other species."

The general goal of using extra teachers is to _ .	"Speaking in his first National Day Rally speech on 15 August, Prime Minister Lee Hsien said Singapore's education system was set for more reforms in the years ahead, particularly for the primary and secondary education.Read the summary of his thoughts on education below. For a start, the Government is prepared to send and additional 3,000 teachers to Singapore schools, cut the courses of study even further and change the way the mother tongue, especially Chinese, is taught.But, for the changes to be successful, parents need to help. Singapore has a devoted group of teachers and principals and quite a few of them are outstanding, but the Republic's schools can be even better.To help the schools make a jump in quality, the Government plans that within the next 6 years, it will send 1,000 more teachers to primary schools, 1,400 to secondary schools and 550 more to junior colleges.Each school would decide how to use its extra teachers.Some may want to make classes smaller so students get more individual attentions while others may have new teachers assist more senior teachers, but the overall goal is to give teachers the time and space to come up with ways to bring out the best in their students. More teachers must not mean more homework, however.In fact, the Prime Minister wants to see the courses cut down so that there is less pressure on the students.Good grades are important but they should not be the only goal students have.PM Lee is convinced that ""we must teach less so that our children can learn more."" Another change will be in the teaching of the mother tongue so that students can become more fluent.The key is to teach Chinese as a living language not just an academic subject like Latin.Therefore, the focus should be on speaking and reading the language.To do this, there must be an environment outside the classroom that is contributing to strengthening the Chinese lessons."

"The author ""wrote the text to _ """	In the September of my gap year, I left school to take a semester-long outdoor leadership course run by the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) in the region of South America called Patagonia. The concept of the course is to give students a chance to really develop both outdoor skills and life skills. The NOLS does an amazing job in designing their courses so that students get a full range of experiences from which they can learn many new things. We spent the first part of our semester obtaining our Wilderness First Responder certificates. This involved a 10-day, 80-hour, EMT taught course at the NOLS base camp in Patagonia. We learned many medical skills that all could be applied to everyday environments as well as the wilderness we were about to enter. After the first part of the semester, we set off on a 30-day sea expedition along the coast of the southern tip of Chile. During this expedition we learned a lot of useful skills for our future life. What excited me most was to see a large glacier pouring right out into the sea. It was unlike anything I had ever seen, and the satisfaction of reaching such a remote place all with my own power was amazing. The next part of our semester was another 30-day expedition traveling through the Andes mountain range of southern Chile and Argentina. Again we learned many technical outdoor skills and some great life skills, such as how to be effective leaders and how to function as a single group. The highlight of this part was being able to ice climb on a glacier using anchors and ropes that we set up ourselves. The final part of the NOLS semester was a 10-day small group expedition. This was an opportunity for us to get into small groups of 4 or 5 and put all the skills we had developed over the course. We planned our own routes, prepared our own clothes and equipment, and _ our plans without the help of instructors. It was a great sense of achievement to be out there on our own and ensure safety with our own knowledge. I really enjoyed my first experience of my gap year!	['share his experiences in the NOLS']
According to the description of whales, we can know that _ .	If a noisy neighbor is blasting music at all hours of the day and night, drowning out your phone conversations and interrupting your sleep, you can call the police. But what is a whale to do? Natural noise from waves, wind, rain and even earthquakes is common in oceans. Unfortunately, man-made noise from oil and gas drilling, sonar, and ships is also present. Low frequency noise has doubled off the California coast every decade since the nineteen sixties. The main reasons are ships' propellers . They not only generate continuous low frequency sound, some propellers cavitate , which means they create air bubbles that collapse, creating loud popping sounds. Whales use low frequency calls to communicate across thousands of miles of ocean. They are threatened by noise pollution because it can prevent them from contacting each other and from locating their foods. Endangered humpback and right whales, which use fibrous baleen to strain food from the water, are the most at risk. Scientists studying right whales off Canada's east coast have discovered that whales are sending louder calls through the water to make themselves heard. Because they invest more energy in making calls, they have less energy available for finding food and mating. Other scientists measuring whale calls against background noise pollution have discovered that right whales have lost about eighty percent of their normal communication area. This could seriously affect survival of this already threatened species. Scientists don't have badges and guns, but they are trying to correct the noise pollution problem. By tracking ships and marine mammals and understanding how noise travels, they are creating sound maps. They hope to get shipping lanes moved so that the noise pollution ships create will not overlap with areas most important to the whales.	['The communication between whales is through low frequency calls']
What is the main idea of the passage?	"When students and parents are asked to rate subjects according to their importance, the arts are unavoidably at the bottom of the list. Music is nice, people seem to say, but not important. Too often it is viewed as mere entertainment, but certainly not an education priority .This view is shortsighted. In fact, music education is beneficial and important for all students. Music tells us who we are. Because music is an expression of the beings who create it, it reflects their thinking and values, as well as the social environment it came from. Rock music represents a lifestyle just as surely as a Schubert song. The jazz influence that George Gershwin and other musicians introduced into their music is obviously American because it came from American musical traditions. Music expresses our character and values. It gives us identity as a society. Music provides a kind of perception that cannot be acquired any other way. Science can explain how the sun rises and sets. The arts explore the emotional meaning of the same phenomenon. We need every possible way to discover and respond to our world for one simple but powerful reason: No one way can get it all. The arts are forms of thought as powerful in what they communicate as mathematical and scientific symbols. They are ways we human beings ""talk"" to each other. They are the language of civilization through which we express our fears, our curiosities, our hungers, our discoveries, and our hopes. The arts are ways we give form to our ideas and imagination so that they can be shared with others. When we do not give children access to an important way of expressing themselves such as music, we take away from them the meanings that music expresses. Science and technology do not tell us what it means to be human. The arts do. Music is an important way we express human suffering, celebration, the meaning and value of peace and love. So music education is far more necessary than people seem to realize."	['Music education deserves more attention.']

Why did Lisa feel worried during the trip to the United States?	My name is Lisa. Because of my job, I often went to the United States. I often felt worried during my trip because I didn't speak English well. So I decided to learn English. I went to Mrs Brown's English class. Before I came to the class, I always walked away when I met any Americans. But now I try to talk to Americans in English. And I like going to supermarkets, cafes and restaurants to talk with local people. I learn English in four ways. First , I listen to the teacher carefully and keep speaking in class. Second, I do my homework after I get home. I learn at least five words every day. Third, I listen to American radio and watch American TV programs. Finally, I surf the Internet to talk with different people in English. To learn English well, I think you must learn to open your mouth. For me that is the key to opening the door of learning English.	"[""Because she didn't speak English well.""]"
According to the passage, nature meant _ to Duncan.	Many artists late in the last century were in search of a means to express their individuality. Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. The beginnings of modem dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed. Her search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea. Her great contributions are in three areas. First, she began the expansion of the kinds of movements that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concerts. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity shown by complicated, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using all her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art. Her second contribution lies in dance costumes . She discarded corset, ballet shoes, and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing clothes, bare feet, and unlimited hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal. Her third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters, including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom. She was as exciting and eccentric in her personal life as in her dance.	['a model for movement']
Swimming at a beach is more dangerous than in a pool because _ .	Lakes, ponds, and beaches mean summer fun and cool relaxation from hot weather. But water also can be dangerous for kids if you don't take great care. Nearly 1,000 kids die each year by drowning. Here are some tips to keep your kids safe in the water: At the Lake or Pond *Don't let little kids swim alone without adult supervision-- lakes or ponds may be shallow near the bank and are suddenly deep sharply further out from shore. *Ponds and lakes may hide jagged rocks, broken glass, or rubbish. *Make sure kids wear foot protection; even in the water, they should wear socks or water shoes. *Watch out for weeds and grass in the water that could trap a leg or arm. *Most boating accidents, particularly among teenagers, are related to alcohol . Be sure teens know about the dangers of alcohol, on and off the water. At the Beach *Teach kids to always swim when and where a lifeguard is on duty. Unlike the calm waters of a swimming pool, the beach has special dangers like currents and tides . Check with the lifeguard when you arrive to find out about the water conditions. *Tell kids never to stand with their back to the water because a sudden wave can easily knock a child over. *Teach kids that if they're caught in a dangerous wave, they should swim parallel to the shore or should tread water and call for a lifeguard's help. Whether at the lake or at the beach, teach your child to get out of the water during bad weather, especially lightning.	['there are currents and tides at a beach']

Which of the following statements best shows the theme of the passage?	"Many years ago I lived in a western country. My very first job was in the city and I was excited to go to work by public transport! I had never been employed before and my chances of travelling on a bus by myself had always been very slim. So, I was very happy with my new lifestyle! I left home each morning in time to catch the 8.05 bus from the main road. One autumn morning I could see the bus approaching. I could also see an elderly lady walking with a lovely dog beside her. There were some youngsters behind her. The bus arrived and we got on. Only eight passengers were permitted to travel standing. I was inside the bus when the conductor called, ""Only eight standing passengers! Could the last one to get on please get off?"" I saw those youngsters inside, right in front of me, and it occurred that they had jumped the queue! I turned and saw the elderly lady with her dog about to get off. I moved quickly to get in front of her. I encouraged her to stay, knowing very well I would be late that morning, but it didn't bother me. It was only as I moved past her to get off the bus that I realized -- she was blind! Her dog was her guide dog! Well, I eventually got to the office. After the day's work I went to the bus stand in front of my office to make the return journey. What a pleasant surprise! The lady and her dog were there! I was really pleased because I would get a better chance to speak with her. I started the conversation and she recognized my Asian accent! She asked if I was the same person who helped her that morning. Amazing! From there onwards it was one long happy conversation. These beautiful memories are still fresh in my mind. By helping others, I feel content!"	['There is kindness to be found everywhere']
What's the best title for this passage?	"Chinese writer Mo Yan has won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, announced the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on Thursday.The win makes Mo Yan the first Chinese citizen to win the Nobel in its III-year history.Informed of his win today, the author, who was having dinner at home, was ""overjoyed and scared"". Born in 1955 to parents who were farmers, Mo Yan-a pen name for Guan Moye,grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in eastern China.

Some people believe that when the tough new rules come into effect, _ .	"Tough new rules for pubs and clubs - including a ban on drinking games like the infamous ""dentist's chair"" - will be introduced in Britain this year in a bid to prevent the heavy drinking culture that costs the country billions of pounds a year. Other promotions like ""all you can drink for 10 pounds"", speed drinking competitions and ""women drink free"" nights will also be forbidden. But on the other hand, a large amount of offers of cheap alcohol in supermarkets - widely regarded as one of the main sources of Britain's problems with under-age and excessive drinking - will not be affected. Doctors and health experts argue that the government has failed to use its most effective weapon, the taxation of minimum price controls on alcohol. Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he did not want to target responsible drinkers on low incomes, but that the government and the industry had a duty to act on heavy drinking. ""These practices have a real impact on society, not to mention the lives of those who just want to enjoy a good night out."" he said. The ""dentist's chair"", where drinks are poured directly into the mouth by others, was made famous by the celebrations of footballer Paul Gascoigne. That game and others that promote mass consumption will be banned from April and publicans will have to ensure free tap water is made available to the drinkers. A second set of rules enforcing compulsory ID checks and making sure smaller alcoholic measures are on sale will come into effect in October. The government says excessive drinking costs Britain up to 12 billion pounds a year and has announced that any pubs that go against the new rule will face severe punishment. Publicans and vendors could lose their licenses, be fined up to 20,000 pounds or face six months in prison."	['excessive drinking will not be stopped']
Mrs. Jackson returned the letter to Mr. Jackson because _ .	"Mr. and Mrs. Jackson worked in the same workplace. The man was skillful and could make all kinds of parts and repair the machines. The boss liked him and paid him more than his workmates. But he had to give all his money to his wife and she bought the food, clothes and drinks for him. He was angry with her but couldn't say anything. All the men in the workplace were afraid of their wives and they felt sorry for each other. It was March 8 and all the women had a day off. The men could say all they wanted. They said they had to do all the housework at home but the women always spent much money on their clothes. And they didn't think it was fair that women had their own festival but they didn't. The more they said, the angrier they became. They decided to write a letter to the UN and advised them to rescind the"" Women's Day"". And they asked Mr. Jackson to do it. The man agreed and began to write it at a table. Just at that moment when Mr. Jackson finished it, his wife came in. She had left her key in the workplace and came to look for it. The man hurried to hide the letter. But it was too late. She made him hand it to her. Having read it, the woman returned the letter to him and said with a smile, ""How can you post it to the UN if I don't supply you the money for buying a stamp?"""	"[""she thought he couldn't post it without any stamps""]"
What conclusion could be drawn from the passage?	"Learning a second language can improve brain power, scientists believe. US researchers from Northwestern University say bilingualism is a form of brain training -- a mental ""work out"" that adjusts the mind finely. Speaking two languages well affects the brain and changes how the nervous system reacts to sound, lab tests showed. Experts say the experiment performed by the National Academy of Sciences provides ""biological"" evidence of this. In an attempt to prove the guess that speaking two languages is good for one's mind, the team monitored how the brain of 48 healthy student volunteers reacted to different sounds. Twenty three of these volunteers were bilingual. The scientists used special equipment to trace the pattern of brainwaves. Under quiet, laboratory conditions, the bilingual students responded in a similar way to the English-only-speaking students, who formed the control group. But the bilingual group were far superior at processing sounds even when there were a lot of people talking in the room. They were better able to focus on to the important information -- the speaker's voice -- and block out other _ noises. Prof Nina Kraus, who led the research, said: ""The bilingual's better experience with sound results in a hearing system that is highly efficient, flexible and focused in its automatic sound processing, especially in challenging or novel listening conditions."" Co-author Viorica Marian said: ""People do crossword puzzles and other activities to keep their minds sharp. But the advantages we've discovered in double language speakers come automatically simply from knowing and using two languages.'' Musicians appear to gain a similar benefit when rehearsing , say the researchers. According to some theories, being bilingual might help avoid dementia ."	['Being bilingual strengthens brain power.']
According to Neil McClelland, the spray-on liquid glass _ .	"Invented in Turkey and patented by Nanopool, a German company, the spray-on liquid glass might become one of the most useful inventions in the field of nanotechnology. The product was tested at the Saarbrucken Institute for New Materials. It is worth mentioning that the invention is transparent and non-poisonous. The liquid glass can protect any type of surface from damages caused by water, UV radiation, dirt, heat, and bacterial infections. Besides, it is flexible and breathable, which means that the liquid glass can be applied on plants and seeds as well. Researchers found that the spray greatly increases the resistance of plants to bacteria-caused diseases. The trials also showed that the sprayed seeds grew faster. Depending on the type of surface that is to be covered, researchers can add water or ethanol to the spray. Scientists say that _ . The spray produces a coating that is just 100nm thick. Trials by food processing plants in Germany have concluded that foods covered with the glass can store longer than those stored in normal condition. According to Neil McClelland, UK project manager with Nanopool, due to its capabilities, the spray-on liquid glass can become one of the most useful inventions around the world, ending up being used by a lot of industries that will cover their products. At present, the invention is being used by a train company and a hotel chain in the UK, as well as a hamburger chain in Germany that are carrying out tests of the liquid glass for various uses. The spray-on liquid glass was also tested in a Lancashire hospital, where it showed ""very promising"" results, being used to cover medical equipment and bandages. The invention could be also used on clothing, because it cannot be seen by the naked eye, thus clothes could become stain resistant. Due to its unique characteristics, the liquid glass can be used to cover bathrooms, sinks and many other surfaces in the home. According to the researchers, the spay-on glass can last for a year. It is expected to hit the DIY stores across Britain at a price of 5 pounds."	['are being tested by some industries']
The story is about _ .	Many people don't think that the number 13 is a lucky number. Many hotels do not have a 13th floor. The floors go from 12 to 14, and there is no number13. Some people will never sit at a table with 12 other people. They will tell someone to go or ask another person to sit with them. No one really knows why people do not like the number 13. Perhaps one reason is that when people began to count, they used ten fingers and two hands. This made 12. They could not count more. Some Christians say that 13 is not lucky because there were 13 people at a meal the day before Jesus was killed . In a story about the old Greek gods, 12 gods were asked to a meal but one more came. This made 13. It is why the god Balder, who was at the meal, was killed.	['why 13 is not a lucky number']
The problem Howe was trying to solve was _ .	"Early one morning,more than a hundred years ago,an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep.He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem: It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Though he was tired,Howe slept badly.He turned and turned.Then he had a dream.He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine.When he tried to do so,Howe ran into the same problem as before.The thread kept getting caught around the needle.The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe.They came up towards him with their spears raised.But suddenly the inventor noticed something.There was a hole in the tip of each spear.The inventor awoke from the dream,realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem.Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle,he should make it run through a small hole in the center of the needle.This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Elias Howe was not the only one in finding the answer to his problem in this way.Thomas Edison,the inventor of the electric light,said his best ideas came into him in dreams.So did the great physicist Albert Einstein.Charlotte Bronte also drew in her dreams in writing Jane Eyre. To know the value of dreams,you have to understand what happens when you are asleep.Even then,a part of your mind is still working.This unconscious ,but still active part understands your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day.It stores all sorts of information that you may have forgotten or never have really noticed.It is only when you fall asleep that this part of the brain can send messages to the part you use when you are awake.However,the unconscious part acts in a special way.It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first.This is why dreams are sometimes called ""secret messages to ourselves ""."

The teacher put up the sign over her classroom door _ .	"A good teacher is many things to many people. In my own experience, the people I respect the most and think about the most are the teachers who demanded the most discipline from their students. I miss one teacher in particular that I had in high school. I think she was a good teacher because she was a very strict person. I remember very vividly a sign over her classroom door. It was a simple sign that said, ""Laboratory--in this room the first five letters of the word was emphasized , not the last seven."" In other words, I guess, labor for her was more important than oratory, which means making speeches. She prepared her work very carefully and demanded us to do the same. We got lots of homework from her. Once she had broken her arm, and everybody in the class thought that maybe the homework load would be reduced, but it continued just the same. She checked our work by stamping her name at the bottom of the papers to show that she had read them. I think sometimes teachers who demand the most are liked the least. But as time goes by, this discipline really seems to benefit the students."	['to tell the students to work hard in the classroom']

You normally trust people and you are easily influenced by fashion or new ideas . You don't like to upset people , so you never express your real feeling . If you sleep on your stomach , you are a rather secretive person . You worry a lot and you're always easily upset . You're very stubborn , but you aren't very ambitious . You usually live for today not for tomorrow . This means that you enjoy having a good time . If you sleep curled up , you are probably a very nervous person . You have a low opinion of yourself so you're often defensive . You're shy and you don't normally like meeting people. You prefer to be on your own . you're easily hurt . If you sleep on your side , you have usually got a well-balanced personality . You know your strengths and weakness . You're usually careful . You have a confident personality . You sometimes feel anxious, but you don't often get depressed . You always say what you think even if it makes people angry .	['is confident, but not stubborn']

The passage tells us the sea covers _ of the earth.	"The world is not only hungry, it will also be thirsty for water. About 97% of water on the earth is sea water, or salty water. Man can only drink or use the other 3% of the fresh water which comes from rivers, lakes and underground. The sea is very big. Look at the map of the world, there is more sea than land. It covers quarters of the earth, it looks very beautiful when the sun is shinning on it. But it can be terrible when there is a strong wind. Some parts of the sea are very deep. There is one place near Japan. It's nearly 11 kilometers high. If we put that mountain into the sea at that place, there would be 2 kilometers of water above it! The sea is salty. There is one ""sea"" called the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is not a sea. It's a big lake in the Jordan Valley. It's the saltiest. It's near the city of Jericho. It's about 80.kilometres long, between 4.8 and 17.7 kilometers wide. The river Jordan runs into the Dead Sea. The sun is not there and the water is salty. Fish can't live in the Dead Sea and plants can't grow near it. People can't swim well in the Dead Sea, but they can float on the water. The water is very blue and the air is clean. In winter, people come to the Dead Sea to enjoy the sunshine."	['75%']

He takes us into the country or to the beach on Saturdays or Sundays. Our apartment has three bedrooms. There is a bedroom for my mother and father, one for me and one for my brother. There is also a living room, a kitchen, and a bathroom in the apartment. We do not have a garden, but there is a small balcony. There are some plants on the balcony.	['In the city.']
What does the author mainly want to show in the passage?	The Commonwealth games have meant that the eyes of the world have been focused on our fair city--Melbourne. And it would look pretty good, wouldn't it? And what better way to regain our title as world's most liveable city? I'm told that we recently lost the right to say this to foreign friends proudly when the international list was re-examined and we slipped to the fourth place. It's hard to see how Melbourne could have lost its crown when you look at what it has to offer. 24 hours Coles, free transport for drunks on New Year's Eve, a new freeway, it's all here. The first focus for the international press will obviously be the endless stadiums dotted around the city. But as well as being full every other weekend, these great places often play host to slightly older kids. At Rod Laver, even the olds get a look-in as the Christian evangelical road show rolls into town once a year for a night of stadium worship . Another pleasure Melbourne enjoys is that it's very easy to get around. There's a bit of a squeeze during rush hour for sure, but nothing like Bangkok, where the journey home can take longer than growing a beard and parking is barely distinguishable from the drive itself. Driving here is a piece of cake. It must be because the wise people who hand out the taxis seem to actively encourage a career behind the wheel within 24 hours of landing in the country as an educational tool for getting to know the city. No slowing down for learning bends, just go, go, go! As for the social life, with over 40 million bars in Melbourne's CBD alone, we have plenty of places for spectators to celebrate national victory, making this town as good as any and it happens 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. _ . But the rest of the world will know that this is the place to be. The most liveable city in the world. By far the easiest place on earth to cheat death, which is essentially what we're talking about.

When you chat online, you should chat with the people who _ .	"While there are some unpleasant people in the world, let's not forget that most people are friendly! If you find someone who likes the same restaurants as you or who is also crazy about ""Harry Potter"", then feel free to talk the night away! Just keep the conversation light and about your common interests. If a topic is brought up that doesn't sit well with you, keep in mind that you are always in control. Ignore your manners at this time! Do stay open-minded. Sometimes chatting with strangers can turn into a close bond--or just another person you can turn to for a laugh. But when typing away in your computer, it's easy to get carried away and to want to tell your new friend all about yourself. Keep the personal details as secret, and instead talk about fun hobbies or the latest episode of ""The Good Wife"". If Stranger Sally is asking what you look like, time to put up the red flag. It is never necessary for someone to know what you look like. Always listen to your gut .If something inside you is telling you something isn't right, it probably isn't. Pay attention to how your body responds to certain people online. Remember, you never really know who you are talking to just by looking at a computer screen name, so downloading anything is an no. See? Talking to strangers online doesn't always have to be a nightmare .By following these do's and don'ts, chatting with someone you don't know can be a cool experience,and can make sure that you stay safe in the world of the Internet."

Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"There are lots of dangerous and terrible insects in Northeastern India, but the tree-bees are the most terrible. They are killers. Unlike most bees which will sting you only if they are disturbed , tree-bees will attack you in thousands for no reason. And they will chase you for your life. Walking along a dusty road while I was on holiday there last year. I found myself, without the least warning, the centre of such an attack. The air above me suddenly became thick with bees. Though it was hot, I went cold all over. Until then I had never heard of Indian tree-bees, but I had recently seen a film called ""The Angry Swarm"", which was about killer-bees. I began running to the village about half a mile away, but I was soon covered from head to foot with bees. I drove them away with my hands, only to make room for others. Each time I opened my mouth for breath, more bees entered my mouth, until it was stung to twice its usual size and I could hardly breathe. When I reached the village, I found some workers building a house. I ran towards them for help. But as soon as the workers saw the bees with me, they ran for safety at top speed. Soon my eyes had completely closed. I fell into a pile of brick dust. I pushed myself wildly down into it until my head and shoulders were covered. And then I tried hard to get out of the dust, the angry bees made a new attack on me. I was tired out and ran weakly about in circles. Soon I lost my consciousness . Later I learned that two quick-minded villagers ran to a pile of dry grass and quickly surrounded me with a thick wall of fire and smoke until the bees were driven away. They stayed with me, taking stings out of my body for the next three hours until a doctor came and gave me further treatment."	['Tree-bees will not attack people unless they are disturbed.']
What is the best title for this passage?	"More than 10,000 people were made homeless in Ternang when the Sungai Mas overflowed its banks yesterday after six days of continuous heavy rain. The wooden bridge across the river has been washed away. The town is cut off by flood waters. At the fifth mile, Jalan Tengkn, the water is two meters deep. It is closed to all traffic. Flooding first happened at mid-afternoon yesterday along the river banks. People trying to get to higher ground were just in time to escape the destroying of the flood. Most of the flood victims had to leave all their things behind. The National Flood Relief Center was reported to give its help and by early evening the whole town was moved out, helped by the army, police, Red Cross Society and volunteers . The flood victims are now housed in different simple relief centers in the nearby town of Ternang.

"What is the author's opinion about ""No pain, no gain"" in exercising?"	There have always been a lot of commonly believed but exercise. Some people believe that they can't help putting on hold that if they stop exercising, their muscles will turn into fat. Here are some more myths: false ideas about being fat and doing weight as they get older, while others I'll never lose weightI come from a fat family Wrong! While we can't change the body type we are bom with, we can't blame our genes for making us fat. There's plenty of evidence that fatness runs in families, and the main reason is that they share the same habits of eating too much and exercising too little. I am fat because I burn calories slowly Wrong! Fatness is not caused by a slow metabolism . In fact, although fat people consume more energy than slim people,they also fail to realize how much they eat! Keeping a diary can help you work out your daily food intake more accurately. Exercise is boring Wrong! Anything will become boring if you do it repetitively. The key is to develop a balanced and varied program thafs fun as well as progressive. If you enjoy a Sunday walk,take a different route. If you do yoga,try a tai chi class. If you like swimming, set yourself a distance or time challenge. No pain, no gain Wrong! Exercise is not meant to hurt. Indeed, pain is your body telling you something's wrong, and continuing to exercise could lead to serious injury. You may experience mild discomfort as you begin to exercise regularly, but this is your body adapting to the positive changes in your lifestyle and the aches should disappear relatively quickly. If they don't, rest and seek medical advice.	['Exercise should be stopped if continuous pain is felt.']
When there isn't enough food in the future, _ may save people.	3D printers are certainly the superstar today---they are being put to all kinds of uses, including creating model cars for movies. However, none of these ideas are as crazy as the one suggested by Anjan Contractor, who believes that they will be the key to ending world hunger . If you think that sounds a little crazy, you are not the only one, but after hearing scientists, the idea seems to become true. According to scientists, food will become _ expensive and possibly, even out of reach, for billions of people in the future. It means billions of people won't have enough food. This is where 3D printers may save the day. Anjan, an engineer says that the only way to support the large population will be to provide every kitchen with a 3D printer and print out meals. More importantly, it would be to make the basic food from things that we now do not think can be eaten. Anjan thinks that we could easily get the meat protein from insects . Similarly, the vegetable nutrition could be made from greens like grass. Would you want to try 3D printed food?	['the kitchens with 3D printers']
What is the writer's attitude in writing this passage?	Bus crash kills four Taiwanese, injures 15 (People's Daily Online) 14:38, August 16, 2011 A tourist bus crashed on the highway in Jilin province leaving four Taiwanese tourists dead at the scene and 15 injured. According to the Jilin Publicity Department, the bus overturned after _ with a car on the Hunchun-Ulanhot expressway in Jilin province around 440 kilometers away from Changchun. Four Taiwanese tourists were killed instantly, including one man and three women, and of the 15 injured, 14 were Taiwanese tourists. The tour leader provided a list of the dead: The three women killed were Lv Huiyu, 42; Zhao Zhuo, 62; Liao Xiuyun, 42, and the man was Wang Mingwei, 24. Moreover, the injured tourists were mostly elderly. The oldest injured tourist is around 80 years old and the youngest victim was about 50 years old. Five of them were hurt seriously, but their injuries are not life threatening. According to the local public security bureau, the bus had a capacity of 39 people and carried a real load of 21 people.

One is considered vegetative if _ .	"(NEW YORK)---Scientists have discovered small signs of awareness in some vegetative brain injury patients and have even communicated with one of them---findings that are beneficial to how to assess and care for such people. The new research suggests that standard tests may ignore patients who have some consciousness, and that someday some kind of communication may be possible. In the strongest example, a 29-year-old patient was able to answer yes-or-no questions by picturing specific scenes the doctors asked him to imagine. ""We were stunned when this happened,"" said one study author, Martin Monti of the Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge. ""I find it really amazing. This was a patient who was believed to be vegetative for five years."" Ever since a research paper four years ago described obvious signs of awareness in a vegetative patient, families of patients have been demanding brain scans, said Dr. James Bernat, a spokesman for the American Academy for Neurology. But experts said more study is needed before the specialized brain scans could be used in medical treatment. ""It's still a research tool,"" Bernat said. Experts also pointed out that only a few tested patients showed evidence of awareness. And they said it is not clear what degree of consciousness and mental abilities the signs imply. They also noted that the positive signals appeared only in people with traumatic brain injury---not in patients whose brains had been lacking in oxygen, as can happen when the heart stops. The new study used brain scanning called functional MRI, for 23 patients in a vegetative state and 31 that are minimally conscious. Patients are said to be in a vegetative state if they are tested and found unable to do such things as move on command or follow a moving object with their eyes. Minimally conscious patients show signs of awareness, but they are minimal and discontinuous."	"[""his eyes can't follow a moving thing""]"
In the writer's opinion, something that is thought to be the most precious should be able to _ .	"Looking through a magazine in a waiting room recently, I came across an article with the title ""My top five most precious possessions"".It was just a few lines of text with pictures, but it caught my imagination. It's interesting how inanimate objects can take on such significance and become woven into a person's, and sometimes a whole family's life history. Anyway, the article had me considering what my most precious possessions are. It was difficult to choose only five, but here are mine: An old cardboard box filled with my children's baby photos. A yellow pocketsized birthday book of special things (poems, pictures of flowers and trees, etc) given to me by my dad when I was probably about seven or eight years old. A 21st Birthday card from my mum. In it she's written her congratulations, her love, and her hopes for my future. She died not long after, when I was in my early twenties. A few ancient but very beautiful botany books that were once my great grandmother's. She was a botanist in a time when it was ly unusual for women to be qualified in this field and I think she was probably a remarkable and very interesting woman. I'd like to have known her. A brooch left to me by my muchloved grandmother. It was given to my great grandmother (her mother) by my great grandfather on his return from World War I. It is not worth anything in terms of money. However, it not only stands for a link between four generations of women, but it is also a reminder of one young man's return from World War I. How about you? I'd love to hear what you feel are your most precious possessions."	"[""change a person's and even the whole family's life history""]"
From the information in this passage we know that _ .	About one million years ago, the Ice Age began. The Ice Age was a long period of time in which four great glaciers pushed southward to cover almost all the upper half of North America, and then melted away. Each glacier was a thick sheet of ice and snow that spread out from a center near what is now Hudson Bay in Canada. The winters were long, and the cool summers were too short to melt much of the ice and snow. The ever-growing sheet built up to a thickness of two miles at its center. As all glaciers do, these great glaciers slid. They pushed down giant trees in their paths and scraped the earth bare of soil. Many animals moved farther south to escape. Others stayed and were destroyed. When winters of little snow came, the summer cut into the edges of the ice sheets. As the glaciers melted, rocks soil and other things that had mixed with the ice and snow were left. New hills, lakes and rivers were formed. The last of the great glaciers began its melting about 11, 000 years ago. Its melting formed the Great Lakes. These lakes today are little changed from their early sizes and shapes. The largest of the North American river systems was also influenced by the glaciers. This is the Mississippi-Missouri-Ohio system. These rivers were miles wide at first. Through the years they settled into _ present channels.	['glaciers are destructive']

They are studying hard for this big challenge. Do they have time to do something in memory of their middle school years? Many do. Leng Jingze, 15, from Tianjin said that in her class students are already writing goodbye messages for each other. ""Even the head teacher has a plan,"" said Leng. ""She plans to put all our class photos and the Chinese compositions we have written onto a CD and give each student one,"" said Leng. ""She will also write something for each student."" Wang Zeyu, 16, in Changchun, Jilin said his classmates are making ""lucky stars"" as graduation gifts. They are making the cheerful stars from colored paper. ""Before making a lucky star, you write some words for the person on the paper,"" said Wang. ""He or she can read the words later."" Who does Wang want to make a lucky star for? He said he wanted to make one for his head teacher. ""I'll write: Dear teacher, you always look so serious,"" said Wang. ""But we know you have a warm heart. Smile more!"" In Xiao Xia's school in Beijing, each Junior 3 student will get a yearbook , in which the graduating classes will put their photos and self-introductions. ""Most classes have written an article as the self-introduction,"" said Xiao, 15. ""We have written a poem in the ancient style!"" The poem records the big events of the class's history and is in the shape of the number 9. ""Nine is our class number,"" said Xiao, who felt very proud of the idea.

What do we learn about the street children from the passage?	LaMar Baylor, an American performer in the Broadway musical, spends most of his time in New York City.But since 2011, he has also spent weeks in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda.There, he teaches dance to boys who live on the street.His teaching is part of an effort by the Rebecca Davis Dance Company.The project helps young people learn more about dance and learn how to behave in a classroom environment. Rebecca Davis and LaMar Baylor teach ballet to street children in Kigali, Rwanda.The children have lost all of their families.Some have been in prison; others have sold their bodies for sex.Dance classes provide the children with structured learning and self-expression that they've never had before. Rebecca Davis is the founder and director of the dance company.She got the idea for the project after visiting Rwanda in 2008.There she met a large number of street children who were dancing, and she thought that dance could be used to get them off the street and into a safe place.She believes that learning to dance is a step toward education.She says children can take classes in information and technology after they have learned to attend classes and follow directions. Boys who have done best in the classes win scholarships and are sent to the Sunrise Boarding School.About 30 boys have won this kind of financial aid. As for LaMar Baylor, he knows from his own experience how dance can lead to a better life.He is from Camden, New Jersey.Camden has sometimes been called America's poorest and most dangerous city.He now thanks dancing for saving his life. The Rwanda program is the largest one set up by the Rebecca Davis Dance Company, and Ms.Davis has also set up dance programs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Guinea.About 2,000 children in the three countries have taken part in the project since it was begun in 2010.

What can we conclude from the farmer's experience?	"Once upon a time, there was a farmer in central China. He didn't have money, so instead of a tractor , he used an old horse to plow his field . One afternoon, while working in the field, the horse fell down, dead. Everyone in the village said, ""Oh, what a horrible thing!"" The farmer said simply, ""We'll see."" He was so peaceful and so calm that everyone in the village got together and, admiring his attitude, gave him a new horse as a gift. Everyone's reaction now was, ""What a lucky man!"" And the farmer said, ""We'll see."" A couple of days later, the new horse jumped over a fence and ran away. Everyone in the village shook their heads and said, ""What a poor fellow!"" The farmer smiled and said, ""We'll see."" Eventually, the horse found his way home, and everyone said, ""What a fortunate man!"" The farmer said, ""We'll see."" Later in the year, the farmer's young boy went out riding the horse and fell and broke his leg. Everyone in the village said, ""What a poor boy!"" The farmer said, ""We'll see."" Two days later, the army came into the village to draft new recruits .When they saw the farmer's son had a broken leg, they decided not to recruit him. Everyone said, ""What a fortunate young man!"" The farmer smiled again and said, ""We'll see."" There's no use in overreacting to the events and circumstances of our everyday lives. When our hearts are in the right place, all events and circumstances are gifts that we can learn valuable lessons from."	['What looks like a setback  may be a gift.']
"The best title for this passage is "" _ ""."	"WASHINGTON--More than one in 10 of the nation's airline pilots are cleared to carry a handgun while flying, and the number will continue to grow, according to a Transportation Security Administration projection. The Federal Air Marshal Service, a TSA agency that runs the armed-pilots program, reports that 85,000 to 90,000 pilots and crewmembers flying domestic passengers and cargo planes are eligible to carry a gun. That puts the number of armed pilots at about 9,500. The TSA projects the program to grow to 16.5% of eligible pilots by the year 2011. Aviation experts were surprised and alarmed that so many pilots are toting guns in the sky. ""That's a big number compared to what I thought it would be,"" said aviation-security consultant Rich Roth, who said he had predicted there would be fewer than 1,000 armed pilots. The 5-year-old program trains pilots for one week and arms them with 40-caliber semiautomatic pistols. ""That's a scary number,"" said Joseph Gutheinz, a former Transportation Department special agent and aviation attorney in Houston. ""By allowing so many pilots the opportunity to fly armed, we're giving terrorists opportunity to identify somebody who has a gun and overpower him."" Capt. Bob Hesselbein, head of security for the Air Line Pilots Association, said the number of armed pilots is ""a tremendous deterrent "" to hijackings. ""The challenge of an organized terrorist team is to take control of the cabin, then the flight deck."" Armed pilots have come under scrutiny since March 22 when the gun of a US Airways pilot fired in the cockpit of Flight 1536 as it approached Charlotte from Denver. No one was hurt, and the plane landed safely after the bullet pierced the fuselage."	['More than 10% of pilots allowed to fly armed']

The passage is mainly about _ .	"The Red Sea is parting again, but this time no one can help. Satellite pictures show that the Arabian plate and the African plate are moving away from each other, stretching the Earth's crust and widening the southern end of the Red Sea. Last September, series of earthquakes started splitting the planet's surface in Ethiopia. Over a period of three weeks, the sides on the rift separated by 26 feet. ""We think that the crust is melted slowly at depths greater than 10 kilometers, where it is hotter, forming molten rock,"" said Tim J Wright. ""This molten rock rises through the crust because it is less dense than the surrounding rock."" The molten rock collects at depths of 3 to 5 kilometers. Wright explained, ""Slowly, the pressure has been building up until last September when it finally cracked, breaking the crust."" The entry of molten rock into the gap between continents, rather than the cracking of the crust, is responsible for separation of continent drifts. For the past 30 million years Africa and Arabia have been going through the continental rifting process, the same one that made the Red Sea part again. ""The ground is continually moving---much more rapidly now than before,"" Wright said. ""On average, the two sides move apart at about 2 centimeters per year."" This latest split, added to the long-term rifting process could eventually create a huge new sea. Although such processes could take millions of years to occur, this event has given scientists an opportunity to examine the break in real time."	['the cause why the Red Sea is parting again']
From the passage, we can infer that _ .	Geography is the study of Earth and its climates. Scientists use it to study global warming and track the weather. Governments use it to learn where people live and work and to plan what to do with the land. It is now easier than ever to use geography because of a science called space technology. The United States launched its first satellite in 1958. Some space missions that followed were geographical studies. In fact, earth science is a big part of the work of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Astronauts looked out of the space shuttle. They decided to take photographs of Earth from their vantage point. Over the years, picture quality improved. Shuttle photography now shows land features, such as rivers. It can even show the streets of large cities. Photos of the same places at different times show how the land is changing. NASA does not use just photographs, though. In 1958 it launched TIROS (the Television Infrared Observation Satellite). This first use of a satellite to study Earth was effective in giving weather forecasts. It led to the creation of new space tools to use in geography. The Landsat Program began in 1972. This satellite sent detailed views of Earth from space. The pictures were so precise that scientists could count the number and kinds of crops in a field. Landsat showed where Earth's surface had faults along which earthquakes might happen. This information helped in the planning of new cities and factories. Landsat also made discoveries. In Antarctica it located ranges of unknown mountains. It pinpointed small lakes in Virginia that were no ton maps. Landsat, now more advanced, still flies today. Another space tool is Earth Observing-1 (EO-1). This spacecraft flies right behind Landsat. It takes pictures of the same sites. The two sets of pictures, viewed together, show how cities grow and how other places, such as rain forests, become smaller over time. This helps scientists learn how people affect geography. One of the newest space tools is the Geographical Information Systems (GIS). GIS is computer software that helps scientists to study Earth. GIS is different from earlier space tools. Businesses, schools, and even average people -- not just the government --can use it to show them how changes in the planet might affect them.

What is the best title of the text?	"Many people think prefix = st1 /Casablanca is one of the best movies ever made. It was filmed in 1942, during the Second World War, and starred Humphrey Bogart as Rick, and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. The movie is set in Casablanca, a place the Germans hope to take from the French. Rick owns a bar there. In the movie, the German army is coming towardsCasablanca. People who live there are trying to escape before they arrive. Rick has two tickets for the last plane out ofCasablanca. His former lover Ilsa arrives inCasablancawith her husband Victor Lazlo. Lazlo is a leader in a secret group, and his escape will help win the war againstGermany. Rick decides to give his tickets to Ilsa and Lazlo rather than use them himself. Rick really loves Ilsa, but he knows that it is more important for Lazlo to get out ofCasablanca. Rick is a very tough character but he is not selfish. He is very good to people who need his help. Some famous lines from the movie are, ""Here's looking at you, kid."" and ""This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" Many people think that the line, ""Play it again, Sam."" is in the movie. Actually, the line is ""Play it, Sam."" Both Rick and Ilsa ask the piano player, Sam, to play the song,As Time Goes By. It was originally recorded in 1931 and became very popular because of this movie. The movie was filmed almost entirely in the Warner Brothers film studios in Hollywood, using special effects. It won several Academy awards and is well worth seeing. If you've already seen it, see it again, Sam!"	['Review ofCasablanca']

All the following are related to the discoveries of science and the application of them EXCEPT _ .	"The very great success in science just before and after the midpoint of the twentieth century has caused educators in the United States to realize that science teaching in the future must differ from science teaching in the past. During the past twenty years, science has played an important part in shaping the character of our civilization. The welfare, stability, and security of our nation and the continuation of a free society are closely related to the discoveries of science and the applications of these discoveries. The scientific revolution we are beginning to experience, together with the trend toward world industrialization, demands a program of science education with new emphasis, purpose, and content. Simply knowing about the existence of the scientific enterprise is not enough for effective citizenship. Young people need to understand how our society depends upon scientific and technological advancement and to realize that science is a basic part of modern living. The scientific process and the knowledge produced cannot be considered to be _ in themselves, except for the classic scientists. A student should understand the relation of basic research to applied research, and the connection between technological developments and human affairs. More of technology than science will be involved in social decisions, but both are important in public policy. The knowledge and methods of science are of little importance if there is no inclination(,) to use them properly. An open mind, a desire for accurate knowledge, confidence in the procedures for seeking knowledge, and the expectation that the solution of problems will come from the use of tested and proven knowledge are among the ""scientific attitudes"". Science instruction should acquaint students with career possibilities in technical fields and in science teaching. A continuous effort should be made to identify and encourage those who develop special interests. They should be given opportunities for some direct experience of a professional nature; they should also learn about the extent of the various science fields and how these fields are related to each other. But it is even more important for young people to acquire those skills and abilities that will enable them to take the responsibilities for expanding their own learning."	['the boom of our economy']
The purpose of the experiment is _ .	"Yawning sends out certain messages -either ""Oh,this movie is so boring"" or ""I probably need to get some sleep"". But did you know that a yawn can also help your brain to cool down when it is overheated? A new study, led by a research team at Princeton University, has indicated that yawning could be the brain's natural way of regulating temperature. People yawn more often when the temperature outdoors is lower than their body temperature but are less likely to yawn when it is hotter outdoors, according to Sciencedaily. com. The research team did an experiment on 160 people, 80 in summer and 80 in winter, to examine how often they yawned at different air temperatures. The study found that people yawned more often in winter than in summer. Scientists say that when the air temperature is lower outside the body, there is heat exchange between the overheated brain and the cool air. But when the air temperature is higher than or equal to the body, people are less likely to yawn because the hot air they breathe in will make the brain even hotter. When people yawn, their jaw is also stretched,which increases blood flow and may also help cool the brain The study showed that the amount someone yawned could be related to the amount of time they spent outside. The longer they spent outside in summer, the less they yawned. Nearly 40 percent of participants yawned within their first five minutes outside, but after that the percentage was reduced to less than 10 percent. However, the result was the opposite in winter. The number of people who yawned increased when they spent more than five minutes outdoors. But the change was only slight compared to summertime. According to Gallup, this is the first report to show that yawning frequencies change depending on season. This could help us to understand better the way our brains work. It may also help us understand the reason why frequent yawning can sometimes be a sign of brain disease."	"[""to find the frequency of people's yawning""]"
What is the author's attitude towards school music programs?	"Whether it is Mozart or Miley,your choice of music could determine whether you will perform well al your work. A new study suggests that listening to music in the office improves the speed and accuracy of tasks such as data entry,proof reading and problem solving. In an office-based experiment,88 pet cent of participants were found to produce their most accurate work when listening to music. The study also found that 81 per cent completed their fastest work when music was played. And it matters what type of music you listen to.For instance,if you're doing your tax returns,then classical music is the most effective as it improves maths skills. Listening to Jessie J or Justin Bieber could also improve your speed,with 58 per cent of participants completing data entry tasks faster while listening to pop songs. During proof-reading,dance music,such as David Guetta,had the biggest positive impact with participants increasing their speed by 20 per cent compared to tests undertaken with no music at a11. Dance music also had a positive effect on spell-checking with a 75 per cent pass rate compared to 68 percent when no music was played al a11. The research,undertaken by Brighton-based Mindlab International,suggests that silent offices may be the least productive. ""The music experiment showed that when listening to music,nine out of 10 people performed better,""said Dr.David Lewis.Chairman of Mindlab International. ""Proper music enables people to quickly process and keep information,regulate their behaviors,make good choices,solve problems,plan and adjust to changing mental demands,""a senior investigator of Mindlab International explains. ""While many schools are cutting music programs and spending more and more time on test preparation,our findings suggest that musical training may actually help to set up children for a better academic future.""added D r.David Lewis."

Lightning strikes _ .	Lightning is shocking, and it happens all over the world! Scientists think that there are more than three million lightning strikes every day in the world-that's thirty strikes every second. Lightning can also be very dangerous. Every year, lightning kills people because it can start big fires or because it reaches temperatures up to 28,000 degrees centigrade. American Roy Sullivan, who worked in a park, holds the record for _ the most lightning strikes. Between 1942 and 1983, he was hit seven times! So, why does lightning strike? Lightning strikes happen when ice and water in clouds rub together, and cause atmospheric changes. When this happens, it creates a static charge . Lightning can strike inside the cloud, between two clouds and between a cloud and Earth. It's the last type of strike that is the most dangerous for humans. About 1,000 people get struck by lightning every year in the United States, and about 100 of them die as a result. Lightning is certainly not something _ . When lightning strikes, it's best to stay inside a large building. To stay safe, do not stand under trees, on hills or near water. Trees attract lightning. Also, do not lie down on the ground, otherwise the electricity may go through you and cause a heart disease.	['can reach very high temperatures']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"If you have a bad habit of losing things, a new device that can be connected to any item that you might lose may be the way to solve your problem. The Tile, a small square linked up to your iPhone or iPad via Bluetooth, lets you see how close you are to the missing item, within a 50-to 150-foot range . If the item goes out of your phone's 150-foot range, it can still be detected on other smartphones with the same app. When you log into the app on your phone, it shows you, with green bars that increase or decrease, how far away you are from the Tile. You can also program it to make a sound when you get close to the Tile. And you can link up your phone with up to ten Tiles. And if your lost item -- a dog, for example, or a stolen bike -- goes out of your own phone's 150-foot Bluetooth range, you can set it as a ""lost item"". If any of the phones with the Tile app comes within the range of your lost item, a message will be sent to your own phone, reminding you of its position. The Tile app also has the function to remember where it last saw your Tile, so that you can easily find where you left it. Since the Tiles use Bluetooth rather than GPS, they never run out of battery or need to be charged, and they last for one year before needing to be replaced. The app, which will come into the market this winter, works with iPhone 5S, iPhone 6, iPad Mini, iPad 3rd and 4th generation, and iPod 5th generation."

We can infer from the story that _ .	"What is the hottest topic at your school? In Hangzhou Yongjin Middle School, it's money. The school had an activity called ""making a living"" recently. About 800 Junior 1 and Junior 2 students were divided into 112 teams. They went out to make money by selling things. What did they choose to sell? Some sold newspapers; some chose bottled water; some sold environmentally friendly shopping bags and bamboo baskets. Huqi's team decided to sell educational books in front of the Children Activity Centre. They thought parents would like to buy books for their children. But unfortunately , they came across urban management officers . The officers asked them to leave. ""We played hide-and-seek with the officers for the whole morning,"" said Hu. ""Finally we gave up and moved to other place. Wang Yongyi and her team sold ice cream in a square. They didn't meet any officers. But few people were interested in what they were selling. The team then put up a board saying the money was to help the ""Project Hope"" for country kids. It worked. More people came to their stall. A foreigner even gave them 100 yuan. Meng Zhaoxiang and his team were luckier. They sold all their cakes in four hours, spending 39.5 yuan and getting back 80 yuan. ""It was not easy to make the money,"" said Meng.

Every time the writer packed lunches for her children, _ .	"From the time each of my children started school, I packed their lunches. And in each lunch I packed, I left a note. The note might be a thank-you for a special moment, or a few words of encouragement for the coming test or sporting event. When they were little, they loved their notes. And when I went back to teaching, they even put notes in my lunches. As they grew older, my elder son, Marc, told me that he no longer needed my daily notes. Telling him that he no longer needed to read them but I still needed to write them, I continued the tradition until the day he graduated. Six years after high school graduation, Marc called and asked if he could stay at home for a couple of months. He had spent those years well, and he was very successful. He lived far away from home. With his younger sister leaving for college, I was especially looking forward to seeing Marc at home. Since I was still making lunch every day for his younger brother, I packed one for Marc, too. Imagine my surprise when I got a call from my 24-year-old son, complaining about his lunch. ""Did I do something wrong? Aren't I still your kid? Don't you love me any more, Mom?"" he asked. I laughingly asked him what was wrong. ""My note, Mom,"" he answered. ""Where's my note?"" This year my younger son will be in high school. He, too, has said that he is too old for notes. But like his elder brother and sister, he will receive those notes till the day he graduates."	['she wrote them a note']
How fast should we read?	If you wish to become a better reader, here are four important things to remember about reading _ : * Knowing why you are reading or what you are reading to find out will often help you to know whether to read rapidly or slowly. * Some things should be read slowly throughout. Examples are directions for making or doing something, arithmetic problems, science and history books, which are full of important information. You must read such things slowly to remember each important step and understand each important ideas. * Some things should be read rapidly throughout. Examples are simple stories meant for enjoyment, news letters from friends, pieces of news from local, or home-town, papers, telling what is happening to friends and neighbors. * In some of your reading, you must change your speed from fast to slow and slow to fast, as you go along. You will need to read certain pages rapidly and then slow down and do more careful reading when you come to important ideas which must be remembered.	['It depends on what we are reading.']

You can learn about the writer's history with money _ .	Today, we are talking about money. I can share a bit about my history with money and my new view when it comes to using _ I made a web page with links to posts about our financial journey where you can look for more details of where we've been and how we got where we are now. It was a big part of my story in the past and was a huge part of our downsizing journey. We got out of debt and stayed out of debt. So I feel eager to share the benefits of being on this side. It takes planning and more careful thought whenever a dollar is spent now than it did when I had a wallet full of credit cards. I now like to think all of my dollars having a job. So many of us work for money and don't consider that money should work for us, too. Make your dollars do the job of helping you live the life you want. Each time money is spent or saved, it should be going toward something that you purposefully want for your life. Last week I was out and I spent $20 on food in 3 days. It made me angry because afterward I thought about eating is not at all what for my life. On the other hand, there are times I spend $20 while out with my family and it doesn't bother me one bit. An afternoon out with my kids during which we stop for ice cream, and do something fun together has a completely different feel to it. In the end, I want the dollars I spend to have purpose like I can enjoy life while still planning and saving for the future.	['by reading posts about their financial journey']

For most people, there's a financial loss, too. Also, retirement age is a time when a lot of people have to deal with losing their parents or having serious health problems of their own. Because of all these, retirees are more likely to get depressed. Depression is very harmful. First, depression can make physical health problems worse. Second, _ because it can make people angry. Third, it's hard to get much done when you're depressed. What can we do to overcome the feelings of depression? First, do all the things that help depression in general: drink enough water, exercise, talk to friends, have a hobby, laugh, and spend time in nature. If you feel depressed more often than not, it's probably time to talk to a doctor about your feelings. Second, it's important to keep busy and get out of the house when you can. Make specific plans with friends. Take a class Volunteer. Or just make sure you start each day with some kind of goal. Third, try to focus on what you've gained by retiring. Think about what you may have now that you wished you had before you were able to retire. For example, days that are less stressful, a chance to rest and take better care of your body, more time for your family and yourself. To write, to start a hobby and to learn something new are all new possibilities. Finally, tell your story. You've lived a long time and you become an oral historian each time you talk with someone about your experiences. You can also write in a journal or make a video recording of your memories. Telling your stories can help you look back on your life and career with a sense of wholeness and achievements."	['discouragement (losing heart)']

Why is the BBC planning to quit its west London home?	"Mark Thompson, the BBC's director general, is expected to announce on Thursday that the BBC will quit its entire west London home -- possibly selling the land to Chelsea football club -- as part of main plans that will see more staff moved out of the capital to Salford and elsewhere. The move is at the heart of the BBC's long-awaiting cost-cutting strategy which will see nearly 2,000 more jobs going at the public broadcaster, and some original programming,such as daytime shows on BBC2, _ to save money. Several thousand people are employed at the west London sites,including Thompson himself and the bosses of all the BBC's television channels.The employees are expected to be relocated to Broadcasting House in central London, Salford, or elsewhere. The BBC has been broadcasting at various locations in the Shepherd's Bush area since moving into Lime Grove in 1949.It then switched to the Television Centre in 1960,and more modern offices at nearby White City.But it is now open to selling the site, and the broadcaster has had talks about attracting Premier League clubs Chelsea or Queen's Park Rangers as buyers.Both clubs are looking for new homes. Earlier leaks suggest that the BBC will seek to cut spending on sports where the corporation has already decided to share coverage of Formula 1 with Sky TV -- and imports,such as Mad Men and The Killing.BBC4 is expected to focus on ""arts and archive "", but Thompson has long ruled out closing any channels or radio stations.BBC1 and Radio 4 will be protected,but there are expected to be some cuts to local radio programs, which will see stations share shows outside breakfast and drive-time hours. The corporation is already committed to remove TV Centre by 2015, but because parts of the building are listed, the football clubs have expressed an interest in the BBC's White City offices instead,which could be knocked down. The White City building is where Thompson and the broadcaster's commercial division, BBC Worldwide, are based. BBC sources say the 2,500 job losses being proposed include the 650 cuts to the World Service already announced, with up to l,000 coming from BBC News.It is understood that some staff who have only just made the move to Salford could see their jobs at risk. Salford is now home to Radio5 Live, children's programs such as Blue Peter, and sports output including Match of the Day."	['The BBC has to cut down its cost.']
In the 1960s, long hair represented _ .	"I learned a long time ago that hair has meanings--plenty of meanings. Growing up in the 1960s, my friends and I struggled without parents' control over the length and style of our hair. At the time, hair represented our need to break free from adults in our lives. Long hair represented our freed inner selves. My clients are often surprised when I asked them questions about their hairstyle--why they choose it, how else they've worn their hair, how they feel about it, and so on. However, while it may seem to be a simple topic, even today our hairstyles still have many psychological and emotional meanings. Understanding some of those meanings can lead to understanding of many different aspects of a person's mind. How we view our hair, for example, can show something about how we view ourselves. Our hair can show physical and emotional wellbeing, desirability, and even social and financial status. When it becomes dull or fragile, it can communicate emotional and physical diseases. But hair can also show unrecognized and often unspoken daydreams about oneself and one's world. One woman--a successful professional--wore her long hair in a thick bun . But one day she showed me that tangled hair was kept in the bun. She said that she never brushed out the tangles because the hair showed her secret image of herself as a helpless, disturbed woman, like Ophelia in the play Hamlet. Another woman came to therapy in a huge shirt and huge pants that she believed they could hide the weight she had put on since the birth of her child. She talked about how much she hated her body and how helpless she felt about doing anything about it. But her hair was always beautifully coloured and decorated. When I pointed out that she seemed to have a different relationship with her hair from she did with her body, she said that her hair had been thinning and that she was trying to make it look as good as she could. I pointed out that what she was doing with her hair and her body was kind of contradictory, and wondered if she had any thoughts about that. She was surprised. But as we talked about her contradictory attitudes towards different parts of her physical self, we began to open up all sorts of other thoughts and ideas about her inner self. And interestingly, as we continued opening those internal doors, changes started to happen. She started eating differently and exercising regularly. One day some months later, she appeared in my office in skinny jeans and a tight sweater, and her hair was pulled back in a ponytail. ""I decided to see what would happen if I stopped trying to hide myself, "" she said with a big smile. ""And...? "" I asked. ""People keep smiling at me in the street. My husband hugged me this morning for the first time in ages. And I feel good! "" Besides, selfrespect in both men and women can be damaged by thinning hair;they may feel alone even though they are really not. Given our cultural focus on physical appearance, youth, and health, hair loss can be unpleasant for both men and women. The market is filled with hairenhancing treatments, but there are those who have decided to be against the system and change to the ""bald is beautiful"" position. But it is much harder for women to take the ""bald is beautiful"" approach to hair loss. We tend to try to hide it in one way or another. But no matter what approach you use, it is important to remember that the thickness of your hair has nothing to do with your value in the world. Remember that you have nothing to be ashamed of if you have thinning hair. Thinning hair may not be something you can change, but it doesn't have to control how you represent the person who lives underneath it."	['freedom']
When food is sighted, _ .	"Have you ever looked toward the sky on a fall day and witnessed a group of migrating birds? If so, you probably noted the V-shaped formation of the birds or the birds flying in a ball-like formation. Why do birds fly this way? Many theories have been developed to explain the formation patterns of different types of birds. One theory is that birds fly in certain formations to take advantage of the laws of nature. The birds know that flying in a V-shaped pattern will save energy. Like the lead cyclist in a race who decreases wind force for the cyclists who follow, the lead bird cuts wind force for the birds that follow. This decrease in wind force means that the birds use up to 70 percent less energy during their flight. When the lead bird becomes tired, a more rested bird takes over that position. But saving energy is important for more than one reason. Sometimes food is short during migration flights. Keeping energy enables the birds to fly longer distances between meals. When food is sighted, the birds guide one another in a different way. When a bird identifies a familiar feeding area, it might turn around in order to signal the group to change direction. Then, this bird becomes the new leader. It helps guarantee that other birds will know exactly where it is going. Then the whole group makes a change in direction, gently streaming from the sky down to the ground. This formation is like an arrow pointing to the location of food. Scientists have also studied the birds that sometimes fly in a ball-like formation. Researchers believe that the birds come together if a predator is spotted. The predator may then become impatient waiting for a single bird to fly away from the group. The birds will often dip and dive as a group, frustrating even the most persistent enemy. Scientists report that this is a very effective method of defense against an attack. The birds care for their fellow fliers through teamwork. As transportation expert Henry Ford once said, ""If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself."" When it comes to teamwork, these feathered fliers are a soaring success!"

The author's main purpose in writing this letter is to _ .	"To Whom It May Concern: On March 5, 2012 , I bought a Perfect Muffin Kit from your store at Midfield Shopping Center. The cashier who assisted me was George. George was very friendly and told me that the Perfect Muffin Kit would live up to the guarantee on the box: ""Perfect Muffins Every Time!"". Unfortunately, this product did not live up to what it promised . The muffins I made were far from perfect . I followed the directions in the package very carefully . First , I removed the bag of mix from the box. Then , I poured it into a bowl. Next, I added the correct amount of water to the mix and stirred it. According to the directions, after stirring the mixture , I added half a cup of dried grapes, nuts , berries, or another favorite ingredient . My favorite ingredient happens to be hot sauce . I find that a bit of hot sauce makes pizza and soup taste very delicious. So, continuing to follow the directions, I added half a cup of hot sauce to the mix and stirred it. Finally, I poured the mix into muffin tins and baked it in the baker at 350 degrees for exactly 20 minutes. When the muffins finished baking, I was very excited to eat the ""Perfect Muffins"" as promised on the box. You can imagine my disappointment when, upon tasting the muffins, I discovered that they were not perfect. These muffins were , in fact , absolutely terrible. Not even my dog was interested in eating these supposedly ""perfect"" muffins. I would appreciate a full refund( money to be returned) of $3.99 for this product as soon as possible. Enclosed are the receipt, the empty box, and one of the un-perfect muffins so that you can experience it for yourself . Thank you for your attention to this matter.

What can we learn from the text?	"Sorry to say, our brains naturally start slowing down at the cruelly young age of 30. it used to be thought that this couldn't be helped, but new studies show that people of any age can train their brains to work faster . ""Your brain is a learning machine,"" says prefix = st1 /UniversityofCaliforniascientist Dr. Micha3el Merzenich. Given the right tools, we can train our brains to act like they did when we were younger. All that's required is the practice designed just for the purpose: a few exercises for the mind. Merzenich has developed a computer-based training method to speed up the process in which the brain deals with information (positence. com). Since much of the data we receive comes through speech, the Brain Fitness Program works with language and hearing to better speed and accuracy . Over the course of training, the program starts asking you to distinguish sounds (between ""dog"" and ""dog"", for example) at an increasingly faster speed. It's a bit like tennis instructor, says Merzenich, hitting balls at you faster and faster to keep you challenged . You may start out slow, but before long you're pretty quick. The biggest finding in brain research in the last ten years is that _ If you ask your brain to learn, it will learn. And it may even speed up while in the process. To keep your brain young and plastic you can do one of a million new activities that challenge and excite you: playing table tennis or bridge, doing crossword puzzles, learning a language....""When it comes to preventing ageing, you really do 'use it or lose it"", says Barbara Sahakian, professor at CambridgeUniversity."

On Dec.15,1989, a 747 jetliner _ .	"""One thing I enjoy about my job is that I can work on something that is actually active,"" says Game McGimsey, an American volcanologist . Part of his job includes keeping an eye on Alaska's many active volcanoes and giving people a heads-up when a volcano might erupt . Like most jobs in the science, volcanology requires a lot of education. McGimsey received an undergraduate degree in geology at the University of North Carolina, then landed an internship with a geologist at the USGS whose work field was about volcanoes. After earning a graduate degree at the University of Colorado, McGimsey accepted a job with the USGS and has been with the Alaska Volcano Observatory for 25 years. Volcanoes can influence the world in ways we might not think about. For example, on Dec.15 1989, a 747 jetliner (a large airplane) flew through a thick ash cloud produced by Mount Redoubt, an Alaskan volcano that hadn't erupted in 25 years. The ash caused all four engines to die, and the plane's electronics went dead. ""The plane was within several thousand feet of flying into the mountains below when the pilots got a couple of engines restarted and landed safely in Anchorage,"" McGimsey says. It cost nearly $80 million to repair the damage to the plane. Such situations show just how dangerous volcanoes can be. However, volcanologists know the risks and are prepared to protect themselves. McGimsey admits, ""There is certainly a higher danger level in volcanology than some other jobs. We understand how serious the danger is, and we don't like taking unnecessary chances. We avoid getting too close to an erupting volcano, because it is not worth injury or death simply to get a rock or a photograph."""	['survived an air accident luckily']

Ten minutes later, he was back.Oh no, I thought, ""here we go again"".This time I really want to rag him down the train. He touched my arm.""Listen, when we get to Peterborough, shoot straight over to Platform One as quick as you like.The Leeds train'll be there."" I said, stupidly, ""What do you mean?

Many people who have a chance to use the Internet at school, home, and work. They use the Internet for no other purposes than to send or receive emails. It's all very easy. You prepare the message, log onto the Internet, and send it. The message first goes to your Internet Service Provider's mail server, which in turn sends it to the recipient's mail server. On the way your message may go through several servers, each reading the name in order to send it to the right server. The message then remains in the recipient's mail email server until he requests it by ""checking his mail"". The benefits of emails are obvious: mostly it's quick. Also, many people feel that the rules for regular mails don't apply to email, making it less formal, which in turn make email easier to write and send. It's not just friends and coworkers that are receiving emails. Wherever you look, the Web is providing email addresses. This has made communication between strangers easier than ever. You can read an interesting article online and immediately send the author an email. Anyone who posts his email address on a Web page is saying he wants to receive email.

The study deals with the relationship between _ .	"Australian cities can keep their native wildlife -- but only if they can kick their habit of urban sprawl . That's the finding of a new study by leading Australian environmental researchers Jessica Sushinsky, Professor Hugh Possingham and Dr Richard Fuller of The University of Queensland. ""While urban development usually reduces the number of birds in a city, building more compact cities and avoiding urban sprawl can slow these reductions greatly,"" says lead author Jessica Sushinsky. ""Compact housing development leaves birds' homes untouched, leading to fewer losses of birds."" The researchers surveyed native and wild birds in Brisbane's urban areas, including living and industrial areas, public parks and gardens, major roadways and airports. They then used statistical modeling to find out what will happen to the birds as the city grows. The first setting was compact growth -- where multiple homes are built on land that previously had only one house. The second setting was sprawling growth -- a familiar pattern where homes are built here and there beyond the city's current boundaries. The team's forecasts showed that a much greater diversity of species was lost over 20 years in the sprawling setting compared to the more compact setting. ""Urban sprawl resulted in the disappearance of many urban-sensitive birds -- birds that only live in areas where there is native vegetation , such as parklands and woodlands,"" Ms Sushinsky says. ""On the other hand, we found the city with the compact development attracted more birds because it kept more of its parks and green areas."" Now the Queensland Government has adopted the more compact urban growth strategy, which, Dr Richard Fuller says, is good news for Australia's native birds. These birds are environmental specialists -- they need a particular environment to do well. ""While compact development means smaller backyards, it can also make our entire cities more biodiverse,"" according to Dr Fuller. ""The study shows that we should hold on to our green spaces instead of clearing them for sprawling development."" This is the first time science has modeled the effects of different urban growth strategies on birds, the researchers say. ""Statistical models like these are important because they help us to understand the ecological consequences of a particular decision,"" says Dr Fuller."	['city development and birds']

Which is the most appropriate word to show the first cultural difference ?	Living in a culture that is different from your own can be both an exciting and challenging experience. The following are six cultural differences between China and the US to help promote mutual understanding. Chinese people do not have the same concept of privacy as Americans do. They talk about topics such as ages, income or marital status, which Americans think is annoying and disturbing. Family In China, elders are traditionally treated with great respect while the young are cared for. In America, the goal of the family is to encourage independence, particularly that of the children. Unlike the Chinese, older Americans seldom live with their children. Friends Chinese people have different meanings to define friends. Just hanging out together time to time is not friendship. Friendship means lifelong friends who feel it deeply necessary to give each other whatever help might seem required. Americans always call people they meet friends, so the definition of friends is general and different. There are work friends, playing friends, school friends and drinking friends. Money As is well known,the Chinese like to save. They are always conservative when they are planning to spend money. It is different in the US, where far fewer families are saving money for emergencies and education than their Chinese counterparts Education Chinese people value education and career more than Americans, who in turn put more emphasis on good character and faith. Team VS Individual Basically China values the community and the US values the individual. If you achieve something in the US, it's because you are great. While in China, if you achieve something it's because the team, or family, or company is great. Everything you do gets attributed to the greater whole, while in America individual merits are celebrated.	['Privacy']
Which of the following is NOT true?	In junior high school in America, kids study English, writing, math, physics, biology, music and art. At 12 o'clock, the students eat lunch at school. They have meat, vegetables, fruit, bread and a drink, but they like hot dogs and hamburgers best. American kids like sugar, and after the meal they can have a small piece of cake. Students sleep for a short time after lunch. They begin classes at 1:30 in the afternoon. They go to school on weekdays and have classes for six hours every day and then return home. Parents let their kids play or watch TV until dinner at 6:00 p. m. After dinner, they do their homework. Sometimes kids and their parents have a family activity after dinner.

Which is the best title for the passage?	"Once a small boy lived on a farm which seemed so far away from everywhere. He needed to get up before the sun rose every morning to help his father on the farm. After an hour he could take a break for a while. Then he climbed up on the walls along the side of the farm. He could see a house with gold windows. ""If they could afford gold windows, then there must be other nice things inside the house."" He imagined how great it would be to live there. Then he promised himself, ""Some day I will go there and see this wonderful place."" One morning, his father would go to the town and told him to stay at home for a rest. Knowing that this was his chance, he took a sandwich and went across the field towards the house with the gold windows. As the afternoon went on, he began to realize how wrong he was. The house was much farther than he had expected. As he went near the house, he saw no gold windows but instead a place in need of painting. A small girl very close to his age came out of the poor house and stood there. He asked her if she had seen the house with the gold windows. The girl said, ""Sure, I know."" and invited him to sit on the porch . As he sat there, he looked back from where he just came. There he saw the sunset turned the windows of his house to gold! Now he understood that everyone had his own house with gold windows."	['Gold Windows.']
If a student thumbs his/her nose at his/her teacher, the teacher would most probably feel _ .	"The nose is used in many popular expressions. Some people are able to lead other people by the nose. For example, if a wife leads her husband by the nose, she makes him do whatever she wants him to do. Some people are said to be hard-nosed. They will not change their opinions or positions on anything. It is always helpful when people keep their nose out of other people's business. They do not interfere . The opposite of this is someone who noses around all the time. Such people are interested in other people's private matters. They're considered nosy. Someone who keeps his nose to the grindstone works very hard. This can help a worker keep his nose clean or stay out of trouble. One unusual expression is that is no skin off my nose. This means that a situation doesn't affect or concern me. We also say that sometimes a person cuts off his nose to spite his face. That is, he makes a situation bad for himself by doing something foolish because he is angry. More problems can develop if a person looks down his nose at someone or something. The person acts as if something is unimportant or worthless. This person might also turn up his nose at something that he considers not good enough. This person thinks he is better than everyone else. He has his nose in the air. In school, some students thumb their nose at their teacher. They refuse to obey orders or do any work. Maybe the students do not know the correct answers. My mother always told me when I was a student, ""If you study hard, the answers should be right under your nose or easily seen."""	['angry']
"What does the writer mean by saying ""our bus can't be on two roads""?"	Do you know what Fear and Faith have in common? Fear believes in a negative future. Faith believes in a positive future. Both believe in something that has not yet happened. So I ask you, if neither the positive nor negative future has happened yet then why not choose to believe in the positive future? I believe during these challenging times we have a choice between two roads: the positive road and the negative road. And our bus can't be on two roads at the same time. So we have to make a choice and this choice determines our belief about the future and the attitude and actions we bring to the present. I'm not saying we shouldn't have any fear. There are times when fear is a gift. A healthy dose of fear causes us to examine our situation and plan for the future. It moves us to smell the cheese and expect change. When used wisely it allows us to manage risk and make better decisions. Some fear is good. However, what I have observed lately is a supersized, huge dose of fear that is spreading the hearts and minds of far too many people. This oversized fear is causing leaders and their organizations to either act unreasonably or to not act at all. They are either hurrying in a million different directions because of fear. In both cases, fear is leading them to take the negative road to failure. The answer is the positive road paved with faith and a belief that your best days are not behind you but ahead of you. With this belief you make the right choices and actions today that will create your positive future tomorrow. You stay calm, focused and committed to your purpose. You look for ways to save money and cut costs without making unreasonable fear-based decisions that sacrifice your future success. You identify opportunities in the midst of the challenges and you focus on solutions instead of problems. Your faith and belief in a positive future leads to powerful actions today. The future has not happened yet and you have a say in what it looks like by the way you think and act. Fear or Faith. The choice is yours.	['We must choose either a positive or negative road.']

Then, they stretch their other arms out from their bodies and clasp hand. If someone tries to teach you a formal kind of dancing, chances are your teacher will start with the waltz. Have you ever tried to dance like this? There are lots of different kinds of waltz, all performed to different types of waltz music. The music might be fast or slow but what they all have is a regular one-two-three, one-two-three rhythm. The traditional form is the old-school waltz in which dancers turn all the time with a hopping , springy step. This waltz has a slow, smooth, gliding step. There's also the Mexican waltz, which moves much faster. Listen to this Mexican waltz music and you can imagine how fast the dancers had to move. Formal dancing has even become a profession, with people entering competitions. Have you ever seen a formal dance competition? Today, ballroom dancing is almost considered a competitive sport; professionals perform different dances, each with strict rules. Everything from where the dancers place their hands to how they move is judged. In the glide waltz, dancers are judged by how smoothly they move. "" I can dance with a glass of water on my head,"" is a well known sentence used by skilled dancers in the old days. In the past, some people learned how to dance by reading books, while others studied with a teacher called the ""dancing master."" How do people learn to dance today?"	['he is a good dancer']
Photosynthesis is a way that _ .	"We all enjoy the colors of autumn leaves. Did you ever wonder how and why a fall leaf changes color? Where do the yellows and oranges come from? To answer those questions, we first have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are nature's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots. They take a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and carbon dioxide into glucose, which is a kind of sugar. Plants use glucose as food for energy and as a building block for growing. The way plants turn water and carbon dioxide into sugar is called photosynthesis, which means "" putting together with light. "" A chemical called chlorophyll helps make photosynthesis happen. Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how the trees ""know"" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for photosynthesis. The trees will rest, and live off the food they stored during summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange colors. Small a-mounts of these colors have been in the leaves all along. Covered up by the green chlorophyll, we just can't see them in summer. The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in the fall. In some trees, like maples, glucose is trapped in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight and the cool nights of autumn cause the leaves turn this glucose into a red color. The brown color of trees like oaks is made from wastes left in the leaves. It is the combination of all these things that make the beautiful colors we enjoy in the fall."

What was Elvis' music style like most?	"One of the most popular American singers of the twentieth century was Elvis Presley. He made the rock & roll music popular all over the world. He sold millions of records and made many successful films, and he helped change the direction of popular music in the 1960 s. Elvis Presley was born in a poor family in 1935. His parents were simple country people who often took him to church, where he learned to sing, and he never forgot the kind of songs that he used to sing in church as a child. When he was young, Elvis moved from Toledo to Memphis in Tennessee, where he attended high school. But he was not a good student. His only real interest was singing. He began to sing in the style that is called ""country and western"". In 1955 he recorded some songs for his mother's birthday. The people at the recording studio liked his singing and his music. It was country and western music, but it also sounded a little like the music which black people used to sing in the American South. It was called ""blues"". Shortly after that, Elvis met Tom Parker, who became his manager and arranged concerts for him across the United States and new recordings as well. Soon Elvis became famous around the country. Later Elvis went to Hollywood and began to appear in films such as Love Me Tender and King Creole. But Elvis found it difficult to live with success. Like many other famous people, He began to take drugs and his health started to suffer. When he died at an early age of 42 in 1977,his many millions of fans were shocked. ""The King Is Dead!"" the newspaper said. But today his memory and his music live on and will always be remembered as the King of Rock & roll."

What made the two teenagers think of carrying out the research?	Every vehicle needs tires, but eventually they wear out. Roads wear out too, and they often need repairing. But new research by a pair of teens suggests the rubber from worn-out tires could lengthen the lifetime of asphalt pavement. Also roads made with this material might need fewer patches . The young researchers presented their findings in May, 2014, as finalists at the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF). The 64th annual Intel ISEF shows some of the best high school science projects from around the globe. Many roads are made with asphalt, which requires much petroleum. But Jordan is a country that has very few oil wells or other sources of petroleum, notes Mohammad Salameh, who is a 10th-grader at the International School in Amman, Jordan. For Jordan, having to import most of the country's petroleum adds greatly to its cost, the teen notes. The extra expense means that there's less money to build and maintain roads. That has resulted in poorer quality roads. As a result, those roads need to be patched almost constantly. Therefore, 16-year-old Mohammad and his research partner, 15-year-old classmate Adam Belaid, came up with the idea of adding rubber to asphalt. But that rubber can come from old tires. Even a worn-out tire contains much rubber, which means the material should be plentiful, says Mohammad. Drivers in Jordan replaced 9 million tons of tires between 2006 and 2010, and only 0.3% of that rubber was recycled. That leaves much rubber that could possibly go into road construction. But first the teens had to show adding rubber to asphalt resulted in better roads. To test their idea, they created several different asphalt-rubber recipes. They also tried out different temperatures at which the mix was heated. And their tests suggested that when the surfacing material includes 8% rubber, it should hold up for 10 to 15 years of traffic instead of the normal 5 years. And their recipe should reduce the need for patching worn areas from once a year, to maybe once every 5~7 years in the future.	['Frequent road repairs in Jordan.']
Where did Luke meet lemurs for the first time?	Luke Dollar is a scientist. He has spent many years in Madagascar studying lemurs . Here is an interview with him. Reporter: What were you like as a kid? Luke: As a kid, I was an explorer . I lived with my grandparents on a farm in Alabama. I spent a lot of time outdoors. It was a lot of fun and I enjoyed that. From the time I was 6 to 16 years old I was an actor. My mom asked me to audition for a show in Birmingham. I asked my mom to buy me some video games and she agreed, so I went for it and finally got the part. Later, I became a professional actor. For many years I went all over the US performing on different stages. Reporter: How did you start to study lemurs? Luke: When I was on the farm, I was really a wild child and came to love wild things. I did a lot of photography in high school. I became a photographer and did photography for the local paper. Then I became a student of Duke University. At Duke University there is a center -- Lemur Center. I got a job there as a work-study student and met lemurs there for the first time. In 1994, I had a chance to go to Madagascar and decided to study lemurs there.	['At Duke University.']
According to the researchers, which statement is true?	"More than one in eight U. S. adults finds it hard to stay away from the Internet for several days at a time and about one in eleven tries to hide his or her online habit, according to a study showed on Tuesday. The study by researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine in California found one in eight adults admitted they needed to spend less time online, saying this showed ""problematic Interact use"" is present in a sizable portion of the population. The study involved a nationwide telephone survey of 2,581 respondents in the spring and summer of 2004 with researchers then examining the data and preparing the report which appears in the October issue of CNS Spectrums. The survey found that 68.9 percent of respondents were regular Internet users and 13.7 percent of the users found it hard to stay offline for several days at a time. It found 12.4 percent often stayed online longer than intended, more than 12 percent said they saw a need to cut back on their Internet use, and 8.7 percent tried to conceal ""non-essential ""Internet use from family, friends and employers. A smaller number, 8.2 percent, said they use the Internet to escape problems or a bad mood, while 5.9 percent felt their relationships suffered because of too much Internet use. One report published earlier this year said that 5 percent to 10 percent of the population likely will experience Internet addiction . It said signs include a disregard for health or appearance, lack of sleep and reducing physical activities and social communications with others, as well as dry eyes and juries of hands and fingers."

In which stage will people feel most uncomfortable?	"Most people who move to a foreign country may experience a period of time when they have a lot of stress in the new culture. This feeling is often called ""culture shock"" and it is important to learn how to deal with culture shock. First of all, you should know that everyone in a new situation will go through some form of culture shock. There are four general stages of cultural adjustment . The first stage is usually referred to as the honeymoon stage. Upon arriving in a new environment, you'll be interested in the new culture. Everything will seem exciting, and everyone will seem friendly and helpful. The second stage is called the withdrawal stage. The excitement that you felt before changes to frustration as you find it difficult to deal with new problems. The language is hard to learn; friends are hard to make; simple things like shopping and going to the bank are challenges. It is at this stage that you are likely to feel anxious and homesick. If you are one of those who manage to stick it out , you will enter the third stage---- the recovery stage. At this point, you'll feel more confident in the new culture. You'll start to understand and accept the way things are done and the way people behave in your new environment. The last stage is the stability stage---- this is the point when people start to feel at home in the new culture. At this stage, you will behave well in the new culture, and prefer some aspects of the new culture to your own culture. There is, in a sense, a fifth stage to this process. If you decide to return home after a long period in a new culture, you may experience what is called ""reverse culture shock"". This means that you may find aspects of your own culture ""foreign"", because you're so used to the new culture. Reverse culture shock is usually pretty mild and doesn't last for very long."

When Butler heard the woman's scream, he _ .	"Bob Butler lost his legs in a 1965 landmine explosion in Vietnam. He returned home as a war hero. Twenty years later,he proved once again that heroism comes from the heart. Butler was working in his garage in a small town in Arizona on a hot summer day when he heard a woman's screams coming from a nearby house. He rolled his wheelchair toward the house,but the dense bush wouldn't allow him to approach the back door. So he got out of his chair and crawled through the dirt and bushes. ""I had to get there,""he says. ""It didn't matter how much it hurt."" When Butler arrived at the house,he traced the screams to the pool,where a three year old girl,Stephanie,was lying at the bottom. She had been born without arms and had fallen in the water and couldn't swim. Her mother stood over her baby screaming loudly. Butler dove to the bottom of the pool and brought little Stephanie up to the deck. Her face was blue,she had no pulse and she was not breathing. Butler immediately went to work performing CPR to revive her while Stephanie's mother telephoned the fire department. She was told the rescue team was already out on a call .Helplessly,she sobbed and hugged Butler's shoulders. As Butler continued with his CPR,he calmly reassured Stephanie's mother. ""Don't worry,""he said. ""I was her arms to get out of the pool. It'll be okay. I'm now her lungs. Together we can make it."" Seconds later the little girl coughed,regained consciousness and began to cry. As they hugged and rejoiced together,the mother asked Butler how he knew it would be okay. ""When my legs were blown off in the war,I was all alone in a field,""he told her."" No one was there to help except a little Vietnamese girl. As she struggled to drag me into her village,she whispered in broken English,'It okay. You can live. I be your legs. Together we make it.'""

The author writes this text mainly to tell us_.	Do you have back pain or difficulty with your eyesight? If you do, you are likely to have a problem of posture, which can be solved if you ask a help from a doctor promptly. The conference on posture held in Rome this year has brought out the fact that an Italian out of four have posture problems. Back pain is certainly the typical disease deriving from a wrong posture, which can also cause other problems: sight problems, for example, which affect above all children. You might think that women are most affected by these problems, as they are more used to following the trends of fashion, which imposes the use of heavy bags, flat pumps or high-heeled shoes, but the latest conference of the Italian Society of Orthopedics and Traumatology has brought out the fact that men also have bad behavior. About two millions Italian men suffer from backache. Besides wrong shoes and the habits of keeping the wallet in the back pocket for a long time, hi-tech products can cause some serious problems: laptops, iPads, smartphones...all these electronic products together can weigh up to 5 kilos, while the maximum weigh to carry on shoulders should be 3 kilos. The handiness of modern netbooks can have negative consequences, as you can use them when you are lying down. However, it would be better to use them while seated, keeping your back straight and your shoulders relaxed. If you do not disregard the problem and you intervene in it in time, you can start having a right posture, perhaps doing posture correction exercises and more sport. A global posture re-education , a healthier lifestyle and a series of little devices might solve your back problems.	['wrong posture is the cause of many problems.']

The Emergency Services, the Fire Departments, the Police, hospitals, and ambulances stood by, ready to go into action. In railway underground stations, people read notices and maps that told them where to go and what to do in the emergency. This was Exercise Flood Call, to prepare people for a flood emergency. London wasn't flooded. In 1928, people living in Westminster, the heart of London, drowned in floods. And in 1953, one hundred people, living on the eastern edge of the London suburbs were killed, again, in the floods. At last, Greater London Council took actions to prevent this disaster from happening again. Though a flood wall was built in the 1960s, Londoners still must be prepared for the possible disaster. If it happens, 50 underground stations will be under water. Electricity, gas and phone services will be out of action. Roads will be drowned. It will be impossible to cross any of the bridges between north and south London. Imagine: London will look like the famous Italian city, Venice. But this Exercise Flood Call didn't cause panic among Londoners. Most people knew it was just a warning. One lady said, ""It's a flood warning, isn't it. ? The water doesn't look high to me."""

Which statement about Armstrong is true?	"Louis Armstrong had two famous nicknames . Some people called him Bagamo. They said his mouth looked like a large bag. Musicians often called him Pops, as a sign of respect for his influence on the world of music . Born in 1901 in New Orleans, he grew up poor, but lived among great musicians. Jazz was invented in the city a few years before his birth. Armstrong often said,"" Jazz and I grew up together."" Armstrong showed a great talent for music when he was taught to play the cornet at a boy's home. In his late teens, Armstrong began to live the life of a musician. He played in parades, clubs, and on the steamboats that traveled on the Mississippi River. At that time, New Orleans was famous for the new music of jazz and was home to many great musicians. Armstrong learned from the older musicians and soon became respected as their equal. In 1922 he went to Chicago. There, the tale of Louis Armstrong began. From then until the end of his life, Armstrong was celebrated and loved wherever he went. Armstrong had no equal when it came to playing the American popular song. His cornet playing had a deep humanity and warmth that caused many listeners to say, ""Listening to Pops just makes you feel good all over."" He was the father of the jazz style and also one of the best-known and most admired people in the world. His death, on July 6, 1971, was headline news around the world."

Instead of going on location, producers can recreate the city's look in studios with the help of computers at lower cost. But San Francisco still attracts moviemakers, as its long history of film offers plenty of iconic spots to visit. Here are just a few: Alcatraz: The Enforcer (1976), Escape From Alcatraz(1979), Murder in the First (1995), The Rock (1996) A federal prison from 1934 to 1963, Alcatraz housed notorious criminals. Now a national park, Alcatraz offers visitors a chance to tour the prison, including a look at one of the cells portrayed in Clint Eastwood's Escape from Alcatraz, with the concrete chipped away behind the vent . Fort Point, Golden Gate Bridge: High Anxiety (1977), Foul Play (1978), The Presidio(1988), Dopamine(2003) Built to protect the San Francisco Bay area from attacks during the Civil War, Fort Point is where James Stewart saved Kim Novak in Vertigo, right at the base. The bridge has also been blown up countless times on films, including inX-Men:The last Stand (2006) andMonsters vs. Aliens(2009). The best view is from the north side, looking back to the city. Coit Tower: The Enforcer, Inner Space(1987), The Presidio, Sister Act 2(1993), The Rock, Dr. Dolittle (1998), Boys and Girls(2003) The narrow white concrete column at the top of Telegraph Hill has been a part of San Francisco's skyline since 1933, and offers amazing views of the bay and the city.

It was used at the end of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Metro City Hall in the 2010 animated movie,Megamind, was an homage to San Francisco's City Hall.	['Fort Point']
The text is mainly about _ .	"Europeans should try to stay indoors if ash from Iceland's volcano starts settling, the World Health Organization warned Friday as small amounts fell in Iceland, Scotland and Norway. WHO spokesman Daniel Epstein said the tiny ash is potentially dangerous for people when it starts to reach the Earth because particles taken in by people can enter the lungs and cause breathing problems. And he also said Europeans who go outside might want to consider wearing a mask. Other experts, however, weren't convinced the volcanic ash would have a major effect on peoples' health and said WHO's warnings were "" _ ."" They said volcanic ash was much less dangerous than cigarette smoke or pollution. Volcanic ash is made of fine particles of fragmented volcanic rock. It is light gray to black and can be as fine as talcum powder . During a volcanic eruption, the ash can be breathed deep into the lungs and cause irritation (,) even in healthy people. But once it falls from a greater distance -- like from the cloud currently hovering above Europe -- its health effects are often minimal, experts say. ""Not all particles are created equal,"" said Ken Donaldson, a professor at the University of Edinburgh, ""In the great scheme of things, volcanic ash is not all that harmful."" And he said most Europeans' exposure to volcanic ash would be ignored and that only those in the near districts of the Icelandic volcano would likely be at risk. Dr. Stephen Spiro, a professor of the British Lung Foundation, said the further the particles travel, the less dangerous they will be. ""The cloud has already passed over northern Scotland and we haven't heard of any ill effects there,"" he said. Spiro said to wear masks or stay indoors to avoid volcanic ash was ""over the top"" and ""a bit hysterical."""	['the opinions on health risk of volcanic ash']
What was the event showing Cuba's change for the better?	"In anticipation of an extraordinary visit, the streets and buildings of Havana, Cuba, were cleaned and painted by dozens of workers. What was the occasion? For the first time in nearly 90 years, a sitting United States president was coming to Cuba, an island nation 90 miles south of Florida. On Sunday, President Barack Obama, joined by his family, stepped off Air Force One and onto a rainy runway, where Cuban dignitaries eagerly awaited him. ""It's wonderful to be here, "" the president said. The last time a U.S. president came to Cuba was in 1928. It was President Calvin Coolidge, and he arrived on a battleship. Obama will be in Cuba through Tuesday. He is set to meet with Cuba's president, Raul Castro, attend a state dinner and even take in a baseball game. The U.S. cut all ties with Cuba after Fidel Castro's communist government took control of the island in 1959. In the years that followed, both countries' opposing political views furthered the separation. Plans for social and economic change began after President Fidel Castro transferred power to his brother, Raul in 2008. Raul Castro then set a plan in motion to revive the country's economy. Since then, Cuba has been taking small, yet lasting steps toward change by removing a number of restrictions that had been set on its citizens, such as access to the Internet, the use of cellphones, and by allowing people to work at jobs not controlled by the government. Cuba, however, still has tough limits on media, public assembly and political opposition. Obama hopes to share his vision for Cuba's future during a speech he will deliver. Before the trip, Senior Advisor Ben Rhodes said the president hoped to use this visit as a way to ""continue to create openings for great engagement between the American and Cuban people."""

What does the passage mainly tell us?	Recently, some concerns have been raised about the health of the world's banana plants. Many media reports have said that bananas may completely disappear in the coming ten years. Bananas are one of the world's most important food crops. They are also the fourth most valuable export. Bananas do not grow from seeds. Instead, they grow from existing plants. Bananas are threatened by disease because all the plants on a farm are copies of each other. They all share the same genetic weaknesses. For example, the Cavendish banana is most popular in American markets. It is an important export crop. However, some kinds of fungus organisms easily infect the Cavendish. Black Sigatoka disease affects the leaves of Cavendish banana plants. The disease is controlled on large farms by putting chemicals on the plant's leaves. Farmers put anti-fungal chemicals on their crops up to once a week. Another fungal disease is more serious. Panama disease attacks the roots of the banana plant. There is no chemical treatment for this disease. Infected plants must be destroyed. Panama disease has affected crops in Southeast Asia, Australia and South Africa. There is concern that it may spread to bananas grown in the Americas. This could threaten an important export product for Central and South America. The International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain, whose headquarter lies in France, supports research on bananas. The group says that more research must be done to develop improved kinds of bananas. The group says that fungal diseases mainly affect only one kind of banana. In fact, there are five-hundred different kinds of bananas. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says the Cavendish banana represents only ten percent of world production. The UN agency says farmers should grow different kinds of bananas. This protects against diseases that affect only one kind. Experts warn that disease may cause the Cavendish banana to disappear. This has already happened to one popular banana because of its genetic weakness against disease. (words: 335)	['The risk to a popular banana shows need to grow other kinds.']

People moved to live underground because _ .	"When you walk into the small Australian town of Coober Pedy, you may be surprised by what you can see. It's just barren land there! So why even call it a town? There are more than 4,000 people of 48 nationalities. However, all of the people live underground! Coober Pedy was established in 1915, following the discovery of opals . The town is sometimes called the ""opal capital of the world,"" because it is the largest opal mining area in the world. Due to a desert climate , people came to realize that while working under the ground was easy, living above it was not. The solution was to move underground, by changing old mines into homes and establishing the world's first and most likely, only underground town. As years have gone by, the homes have become bigger. There are now also some hotels for tourists. They come from all over the world just to see this unusual town. Coober Pedy is probably best known for its unique style of underground living. While the structures may be located underground, they are in no way worse than those that lie above. Not only do their walls have the color of beautiful red, but also the structures have all the modern equipment like walk-in closets, modern kitchens and televisions. And the town also has gift shops selling opal jewelry, a couple of museums and even a church! Besides, Coober Pedy is also a favourite among filmmakers. And it has appeared in a series of movies such as Pitch Black, Red Planet and Opal Dream."	['living above the ground was not easy']
What good news did the author's friend receive?	One day I heard that one of my dear friends had lost his mother. This made me sad, for my friend was very close to his mother. He had been by her side as she traveled through her long and hard journey with cancer. At this time, many memories about my loved ones that had passed away came flooding to me. Finally these memories passed, but it was really sad to think that my friend would have to go through the pain. Three times I tried to write an email to my friend and three times words failed me. I am a person who is not often lost for words and I decided to have a sleep. Upon waking up I could hardly wait for my computer to work, the words I needed were there. I was still left with a heavy heart although I had sent an email. They say that everything in this universe is balanced and indeed it is. Three days later, I received his reply letter. I was happy to hear that he'd been admitted to Cambridge University. It served as a gentle reminder for me that my friend would be okay and that life would go on. Everything in life is balanced; the lowest feelings change places with the highest feelings. Without the lows, we would never appreciate the highs. No matter how dark the clouds seem to be, the sunshine is always there and just waiting for the opportunity to shine through.	['He would go to Cambridge University.']
The reasons why people like time travel are as followings except _ .

When asked about what's so appealing about time travel TV series, 21 percent of respondents answered: ""Those attractive characters."" A bigger reason behind the popularity of time travel stories, however, is the relaxation they offer, according to the survey.Cai Yinong agrees. ""Many people are facing tremendous pressures in their fast-paced lives, so this genre is more relaxing than other shows as it provides people with a terrific outlet to escape reality,"" Cai told China Daily. The love for time traveling is universal.Woody Allen's latest movie Midnight in Paris, which has been nominated for Best Picture, Directing, Original Screenplay and Art Direction for the 2012 Academy Awards, features modernity versus cultural nostalgia."

Indian elephants are getting increasingly angry and they revenge because _ .	"The elephant was lying heavily on its side, fast asleep. A few dogs started barking at it. The elephant woke up in a terrible anger: it chased the dogs into the village where they ran for safety. That didn't stop the elephant. It destroyed a dozen houses and injured several people. The villagers were scared and angry. Then someone suggested calling Parbati, the elephant princess. Parbati Barua's father was a hunter of tigers and an elephant tamer . He taught Parbati to ride an elephant before she could even walk. He also taught her the dangerous art of the elephant round-up -- how to catch wild elephants. Parbati hasn't always lived in the jungle. After a happy childhood hunting with her father, she was sent to boarding school in the city. But Parbati never got used to being there and many years later she went back to her old life. ""Life in the city is too dull. Catching elephants is an adventure and the excitement lasts for days after the chase,"" she says. But Parbati doesn't catch elephants just for fun. ""My work,"" she says, ""is to rescue man from the elephants, and to keep the elephants safe from man."" And this is exactly what Parbati has been doing for many years. Increasingly, the Indian elephant is angry: for many years, illegal hunters have attacked it and its home in the jungle has been reduced to small pieces of land. It is now fighting back. Whenever wild elephants enter a tea garden or a village, Parbati is called to guide the animals back to the jungle before they can kill. The work of an elephant tamer also involves love and devotion. A good elephant tamer will spend hours a day singing love songs to a newly captured elephant. ""Eventually they grow to love their tamers and never forget them.

Which of the following sleep tips is not mentioned in the passage?	You're not doomed to toss and turn every night. Although you might not be able to control all of the factors that relate to your sleep, you can adopt habits that encourage better sleep. Start with these simple sleep tips. No. 1: Stick to a sleep schedule Go to bed and get up at the same time every day, even on weekends, holidays and days off. Being consistent reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle and helps promote better sleep at night. If you don't fall asleep within about 15 minutes, get up and do something relaxing. Go back to bed when you're tired. No. 2: Pay attention to what you eat and drink Don't go to bed either hungry or stuffed. Your discomfort might keep you up. Also limit how much you drink before bed, to prevent disruptive middle-of-the-night trips to the toilet. Nicotine, caffeine and alcohol deserve caution, too. The stimulating effects of nicotine and caffeine -- which take hours to wear off -- can ruin quality sleep. No. 3: Create a bedtime ritual Do the same things each night to tell your body it's time to wind down. This might include taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book, or listening to light music. Be careful of using the TV or other electronic devices as part of your bedtime ritual. Some research suggests that screen time or other media use before bedtime has impact on sleep. No. 4: Get comfortable Create a room that's ideal for sleeping. Often, this means cool, dark and quiet. Consider using room-darkening shades, earplugs, a fan or other devices to create an environment that suits your needs. Your mattress and pillow can contribute to better sleep, too. Since the features of good bedding are subjective, choose what feels most comfortable to you. If you have children or pets, set limits on how often they sleep with you -- or insist on separate sleeping quarters. No. 5: Limit daytime naps Long daytime naps can affect nighttime sleep -- especially if you're struggling with poor sleep quality at night. If you choose to nap during the day, limit yourself to about 10 to 30 minutes and make it during the mid-afternoon. If you work nights, you'll need to make an exception to the rules about daytime sleeping. In this case, keep your window coverings closed so that sunlight -- which adjusts your internal clock -- doesn't interrupt your daytime sleep. No. 6: Include physical activity in your daily routine Regular physical activity can promote better sleep, helping you to fall asleep faster and to enjoy deeper sleep. Timing is important, though. If you exercise too close to bedtime, you might be too energized to fall asleep. If this seems to be an issue for you, exercise earlier in the day. No. 7: Manage stress When you have too much to do -- and too much to think about -- your sleep is likely to suffer. To help restore peace to your life, consider healthy ways to manage stress. Start with the basics, such as getting organized, setting priorities and dividing tasks. Give yourself permission to take a break when you need one. Share a good laugh with an old friend. Nearly everyone has an occasional sleepless night -- but if you often have trouble sleeping, contact your doctor. Identifying and treating any underlying causes can help you get the better sleep you deserve.	['Follow a flexible sleep timetable.']
According to the passage,the advantage of the shift is that IKEA can _ .	"It's hard to be the bearer of bad news,but most of IKEA's print and digital fascinating shots of picturesque rooms and products are fake.Those beautiful,""natural-looking"" photos of gorgeous rooms and kitchens are mostly the work of computer magic,adjusted and corrected until they're picture-perfect. Martin Enthed,IT manager for IKEA's in-house communications agency,revealed,""In 2012,12 per cent of its product and concept images was CGI-rendered,increasing to 25 per cent in 2013.Since then,that percentage of rendered images appearing in the company's catalogue and online has tripled.75 per cent of the furniture company's product images today are created by computers."" It's a move that first caught the attention of photographers and graphic designers a few years back when the furniture giant announced it would cancel photoshoots in favor of computer-generated imagery(CGI). Enthed said IKEA began shifting equipment in 2009 when company officials called in his team and said they weren't pleased with some previous photos and CG images. ""So we looked at all the images they said weren't good and the two of three they said were great,and the ones they didn't like were photography and the good ones were all CG,""Enthed said.""Now we only talk about a good or bad image - not what technique created it."" It's a not-so-secret strategy used by top companies specializing in home and furniture design,though many consumers remain oblivious. The company claims the shift is another way to reduce its environmental footprint,saying constructing digital files produces less waste.It also helps the home furnishing empire's pocketbooks."

"The ""Tennessee Waltz"" is mentioned in the passage in order to show that _ ."	"Patti Page, the top-selling female artist of the 1950s with more than 100 million records sold, died on January 2nd, 2013, when she was 85. She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her ""Tennessee Waltz"" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit . Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: ""With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming"" and ""Old Cape Cod"". Her last hit was ""Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was ""Doggie in the Window"". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program ""The Big Record"". The following year, Page appeared in her own CBS television series ""The Patti Page Show"". She continued to record and perform into the 21st century, most recently releasing an album of songs for children, a Christmas record, and a new ""best of"" collection. Besides music, Patti Page did a bit of acting. She co-starred with the Oscar-winning Burt Lancaster in ""Elmer Gantry"", and also starred on stage in the musical play ""Annie Get Your Gun""."

Why did the younger brother cry for his mother?	"When I was ten, my mother worked all day so I had to take care of my younger brother. At that time my little brother was about four years old and he missed mum all the time. One day, after I had given him his dinner, he started crying for mum. He was so young and really needed mum. So I dressed him, put on his shoes, carried him on my back and walked out. Soon he fell asleep. About half an hour late, I found that he had lost a shoe while sleeping. I took him off my back and put him down. I knew we needed to find that shoe, for our mother couldn`t afford new shoes. We had to go back to find it, so I told my brother to Wait right here. A man heard it and stopped me just before I walked off. He asked me, ""You are leaving your brother here to find the shoe? What would you do if he is not here when you return?"" I did not know how to answer that question. He continued,: It is OK if you can`t find the shoe, but it is not OK to lose your brother."" Then he sent us to mum`s workplace by taxi. I have depended on the kindness of many strangers in my whole life. I feel regretful that I cannot find them and say thank you. I don't even remember what the man`s face looked like, but he taught me a lesson--people are more important than things. ,,."	['Because he missed his mother']
The author mentions Dr.Johnson's comment to show that _ .	"It is widely known that any English conversation begins with The Weather.Such a fixation with the weather finds expression in Dr.Johnson's famous comment that""When two English meet,their first talk is of weather.""Though Johnson's observation is as accurate now as it was over two hundred years ago,most commentators fail to come up with a convincing explanation for this English weatherspeak. Bill Bryson,for example,concludes that,as the English weather is not at all exciting,the _ with it can hardly be understood.He argues that""To an outsider,the most striking thing about the English weather is that there is not very much of it."" Simply,the reason is that the unusual and unpredictable weather is almost unknown in the British Isles. Jeremy Paxman,however,disagrees with Bryson,arguing that the English weather is by nature attractive.Bryson is wrong,he says,because the English preference for the weather has nothing to do with the natural phenomena.""The interest is less in the phenomena themselves,but in uncertainty.""According to him,the weather in England is very changeable and uncertain and it attracts the English as well as the outsider. Bryson and Paxman stand for common misconceptions about the weatherspeak among the English.Both commentators,somehow,are missing the point.The English weather conversation is not really about the weather at all.English weatherspeak is a system of signs,which is developed to help the speakers overcome the natural reserve and actually talk to each other.Everyone knows conversations starting with weatherspeak are not requests for weather data.Rather,they are routine greetings,conversation starters or the blank ""fillers"".In other words,English weatherspeak is a means of social bonding."

What advice does the author give to college students?	"The question of whether our government should promote science and technology or the liberal arts in higher education isn't an either/or proposition ,although the current emphasis on preparing young Americans for STEM(science,technology,engineering,maths)-related fields can make it seem that way. The latest congressional report acknowledges the critical importance of technical training,but also states firmly that the study of the humanities and social sciences must remain central components of America's educational system at all levels.Both are critical to producing citizens who can participate effectively in our democratic society,become creative leaders,and benefit from the spiritual enrichment that the reflection on the great ideas of mankind over time provides. Parents and students who have invested heavily in higher education worry about graduates' job prospects as technological advances and changes in domestic and global markets transform professions in ways that reduce wages and cut jobs.Under these circumstances,it's natural to look for what may appear to be the most ""practical"" way out of the problem ""Major in a subject designed to get you a job"" seems the obvious answer to some,though this ignores the fact that many disciplines in the humanities characterized as ""soft"" often,in fact,lead to employment and success in the long run.Indeed,according to surveys,employers have expressed a preference for students who have received a broadly-based education that has taught them to write well,think critically,research creatively,and communicate easily. Moreover,students should be prepared not just for their first job,but for their 4th and 5th jobs,as there's little reason to doubt that people entering the workforce today will be called upon to play many different roles over the course of their careers.The ones who will do the best in this new environment will be those whose educations have prepared them to be flexible.The ability to draw upon every available tool and insight--picked up from science,arts,and technology--to solve the problems of the future,and take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves,will be helpful to them and the United States."

What's the main idea of the passage?	Scientists are learning new things about Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth. For example, the Antarctic ice sheet is shrinking. A new study found that summer ice loss in parts of Antarctica was at its highest level in 1,000 years. The study showed that Antarctic ice was melting mostly from below ice shelves, where the water is warmer than the ice. Eric Rignot is an earth system expert at the University of California, Irvine. He also works for the American space agency, NASA. There he serves as senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also in California. He says ice melting from below is responsible for 55 percent of the shelf loss from 2003 to 2008. That is a much higher rate than scientists thought earlier. Professor Rignot and his team used satellite observations, radar and computer models to measure features above the ice to learn what was going on below. The measurements show differences from one area to the next around the continent. The major ice shelves are called Ross, Filchner and Ronne. They make up two-thirds of Antarctica's ice shelves. But they are responsible for only 15 percent of the melting ice. The professor says even small changes, like changes in ocean flow driven by wind, can make a huge difference in the melting of the ice shelf. Sixty percent of the Earth's fresh water is held in the huge Antarctic ice sheet. Professor Rignot says the study will help experts predict how the continent reacts to warmer ocean waters and helps to cause rising sea levels around the world. The study was published in the journal Science.	['the Antarctic ice sheet is shrinking']
The Hopeless Ant hated his father because _ .	"Dear Michelle, My Dad hates my Mom. He tells me that she is a liar and that I should not trust her. Of course, they are divorced but they have ""joint custody"" . What a joke! I am 15, my brother is nine, and we have a life of hell, frankly. We live one week on and one week off. This was the brilliant idea of both of my parents, which was fair to them but ruining my life. I cannot get away from his voice and his putting my mom down. Sometimes I think about running away. A Hopeless Ant Dear Hopeless Ant, First, thank you for trusting me with your problem. If all you said is correct, then there are several things that you can and should do to help yourself, your brother, and oddly enough, your parents. You need a family counselor. Such a person could listen to each family member alone and then meet together to talk about the situation. If refused, you need to talk to a counselor in your school. You need to be heard, and you need an adult who will listen. A school counselor can organize a meeting with your parents. Perhaps you need to write to your mother. Writing things down allows people to go over it more than one time. I cannot imagine that she will stand passively by and do nothing at all to help once she reads how you feel. Your father needs a letter as well. He may not realize the destructive effect that it has on his children. Lastly, have a plan in mind when all else fails that is not self-destructive. Life passes very quickly, sweetheart, and you will grow up and have your own life. Until then, you need to keep yourself safe. Never doubt that it will get better. Write back and let me know how everything is going. Michelle"	"[""his father wasn't friendly to his mother""]"
According to the passage, the Venusian scientists succeeded in getting important information about _ .	"There was great excitement on the planet of Venus . Venusian scientists managed to land a satellite on the planet Earth, and it has been sending back signals as well as photographs ever since. The satellite was directed into an area known as Manhattan, named after the great Venusian astronomer Professor. Manhattan, who first discovered it with his telescope 20000 light years ago. Because of excellent weather conditions and extremely strong signals, Venusian scientists were able to get valuable information as to feasibility of a manned flying saucer landing on Earth. A press conference was held at the Venus Institute of Technology. ""We have come to the conclusion, based on last week's satellite landing,"" Prof. Zog said, ""that there is no life on Earth."" ""How do you know this?"" the science reporter of the Venus Evening Star asked. ""For one thing, Earth's surface in the area of Manhattan is made up of solid concrete and nothing can grow there. For another, the atmosphere is filled with carbon monoxide and other deadly gases and nobody could possibly breathe this air and survive."" ""What does this mean as far as our flying saucer program is concerned?"" ""We shall have to take our own oxygen with us, which means a much heavier flying saucer than originally planned."" ""Are there any other dangers that you discovered in your studies?"" ""Take a look at this photo. You see this dark black cloud hovering over the surface of Earth? We don't know what it is made of, but it could give us a lot of trouble and we shall have further tests before we send a Venus Being there."" ""Over here you will notice what seems to be a river, but the satellite findings indicates it is polluted and the water is unfit to drink. This means we shall have to carry our own water, which will add even greater weight to the saucer."" ""If all you say is true, won't this set back the flying saucer program several years?"" ""Yes, but we shall continue as soon as the Grubstart gives us the added funds ."" Profession. Zog replied."	['the feasibility of sending a Venus Being to Earth']
People read newspapers to _ .	Newspapers are an important source of information. Many people begin their days by reading the paper. In this way they learn what is going on in the world.

Jack asked the waiter for _ .	A young man called Jack has visited many countries. He knows few foreign languages, but he can always find someone who knows enough English to understand what he says. Last summer he went to China. He enjoyed himself in China and liked Chinese food very much. One day he went into a restaurant in a small village. He knew the Chinese word 'rice', so he ordered some rice. The village was famous for its mushrooms, and Jack thought they must be very fresh and delicious. He asked the waiter in English. However, the waiter couldn't understand at all, so he could do nothing for Jack. Jack thought hard. When he saw a piece of paper on the table, he had a good idea. He took out a pencil and drew a picture of a mushroom carefully. The waiter looked at the picture for a long time, then he smiled and left. A few minutes later, he came back with a black umbrella in his hand.	['some mushrooms']
Further examination showed that the dead e!ephant_.	Recently I went to the Tsavo National Park in northern Kenya for a film. We set off early for a distant water hole. A huge elephant,covered with dry mud,drank calmly and deeply. He might have traveled 50 km to reach the water. He wasn-t going to hurry now. He-d drink a while and then rest in the shade, and then drink again-or so we thought. What actually happened was that he drank deeply and stepped away. Then he suddenly fell down. Within minutes he was dead. We called animal doctor Jeremiah Poghon immediately. He removed the head of a poisoned arrow from the eLephant s body,and let out over 100 litters of pus -the result of the elephants meeting with a poacher months before. Today's poacher shoots from a blind. He fires an arrow,covered with poison,into the body of an elephant. If the poacher is lucky,the elephant might die in an hour or two; if not,he might have to follow the elephant for days before it dies. Often the arrow head fails to kill the elephant at once-it doesn't mean the poison won't finally kill the elephant,but it will be a slow death. Living in Tsavo through these times,l could see the results of poaching from time to time. When I think about the death of that elephant,what stays with me is the extraordinary silence after the shocking sound of his body hitting the ground. I took some comfort from the knowledge that as the dead body returned to the soil,some animals would benefit-but I couldn't escape the feeling that with the death of such a large animal,the world seemed a poorer and emptier place.

The writer felt she fit in when _ .	"I was a newcomer of Miss Burn's seventh grade. Past""newcomer""experiences had been difficult, so I was very anxious to fit in. Lunchtime was a pleasant surprise when the girls all crowded around my table. Their chat was friendly, so I began to relax. My new classmates filled me in on the school, the teachers and the other kids. it wasn't long before the class herd was pointed out to me: Mary Lou. Actually she called herself Mary Louise. A formal, overmodest young girl with old-fashioned clothes, she wasn't ugly--not even funny looking. Practical shoes, long wool skirt and a blouse completed the image of a complete herd. The girls' whispers got louder and louder. Mary Lou didn't notice this. After school, the girls invited me to join them in front of the school. Arms wrapped around her backpack, Mary Lou came down the school steps. The _ began--rude, biting comments and disrespectful words from the girls. I paused, then joined right in. My force began to pick up as I approached her, mean remarks falling from my lips. I even pulled the belt of her backpack and then pushed her. The belt broke, Mary Lou fell. Everyone was laughing and patting me. I fit in. But I was not proud. Something inside me hurt. Mary Lou got up, gathered her books and--without a tear shed--off, she went. She held her head high as a small trickle of blood ran down from her injured knee. I turned to leave with my laughing friends and noticed a man standing beside his car. His skin, dark hair and handsome features told me this was her father. Respectful of Mary Lou's proud spirit, he remained still and watched the lonely girl walk toward him. Only his eyes--shining with both grief and pride--followed. As I passed, he looked at me in silence with burning tears that spoke to my shame and scolded my heart. He didn't speak a word. No scolding from a teacher or a parent could linger as much as that hurt in my heart from the day a father's eyes taught me kindness and strength and dignity. I never again joined the cruel herds. I never again hurt someone for my own gain."	['others cheered for her after she treated Mary badly']
The four-year-old boy's case suggests that the side effects of psychotropic drugs are _ .	"Many children in foster care are being over medicated with antipsychotic drugs they may not really need, or the drugs are being given incorrectly, according to a government review obtained by CBS News. The report by an Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services looked at concerns surrounding the use of these powerful drugs in children on Medicaid. Many children on Medicaid are in the foster care system. ""Psychotropic drugs are being used in these children, and we don't really know what the side effects are in these young children,"" said CBS News reporter Anna Werner. ""There's not a lot of research because you can't really test these drugs on children."" More than half the time, the review found children on these powerful drugs were not being monitored adequately. A quarter of them were given the wrong amount of drugs. Many were given too many drugs or took them for too long. ""What the experts tell us is that not enough resources are needed to take care of these kids and give them the treatment that they need -- not drugs,"" Werner said. ""It takes a lot of time and a lot of people to do that, and that of course all costs money."" Therefore, states are choosing to just put kids on drugs instead. Dr. Fernando Siles, a child psychiatrist who treats children on Medicaid in Texas and has written thousands of prescriptions for such drugs, told Werner he doesn't have a lot of other options. He said children from troubled homes often have anger and aggression issues and he often prescribes drugs to ""contain"" their behavior so they won't get bounced from foster home to foster home. Werner's reporting also turned up the troubling case of a four-year-old boy who was put on four different psychiatric medications in the foster care system. When his grandmother gained custody a year later, she said the boy seemed like a completely different child since he has taken all the drugs. But he still has frightening dreams at the age of 10. Werner reports a number of states, including Texas, have taken steps to reduce the use of these drugs in foster children. But experts say more progress is needed, along with greater oversight of the system."	['lasting']
It implies that _ .	Many animal and plant species have become extinct and many more are in critical danger. Finding ways to protect the earth's wildlife and conserve the natural world they inhabit is now more important than ever. Dodo The Dodo is a classic example of how human caused damage to the earth's biology. The flightless Dodo was native to the Island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It lived off fruit fallen from the island's trees and lived unthreatened until humans arrived in 1505. The easily controlled bird became a source of food for sailors and was attacked by animals introduced to the island by humans such as pigs, monkeys and rats. The population of Dodos rapidly decreased and last one was killed in 1681. Rhinos The Rhino horn is a highly priced item for Asian medicine. This has led to the animal being hunted in its natural habitat. Once widespread in Africa and Eurasia, most rhinos now live in protected natural parks and reserves . Their numbers have rapidly decreased in the last 50 years, and the animals remain under constant threat from poachers . The Giant Panda The future of the World Wildlife Fund's symbol is far from certain. As few as 1000 remain in the wild. The Chinese government has set up 33 panda reserves to protect these beautiful animals and made poaching them punishable with 20 years in prison. However, The panda's distinct black and white patched coat fetches a high price on the black market and determined poachers still pose one of the most serious threats to the animals continued existence. Whales The International Whaling Commission is fighting to ensure the survival of the whale species. Despite the fact that one-third the world's oceans have been declared whale sanctuaries , 7 out of 13 whale species remain endangered. Hunted for their rich supply of oil, their numbers have decreased to just 300. Collisions with ships, poisonous pollution and being caught in fishing nets are other major causes of whale deaths. Tigers The last 100 years has seen a 95% reduction in the numbers of remaining tigers to between 5000 and 7000 and the Bali, Javan, and Caspian tigers are already extinct. The South China tiger is precariously close to disappearing, with only 20 to 30 still alive. Like the Rhino horn, tigers' bones and organs are sought after for traditional Chinese medicines. These items are traded illegally along with tiger skins.	['The Dodo lacked the ability to protect itself from other animals']

The observation of weather conditions by satellites is helpful because it _	"A weather map is an important tool for geographers. A succession of three or four maps presents continuous picture of weather changes. Weather forecasters are able to determine the speed of air masses and fronts to determine whether an individual pressure aroa is deepening or becoming shallow and whether a front is increasing or decreasing in intensity .They are also able to determine whether an air mass is retaining its original characteristics or taking on those of the surface over which it is moving. Thus, a most significant function of the map is to reveal a summary picture of conditions in the atmosphere at a given time. All students of geography should be able to interpret a weather map accurately.Weather maps contain an enormous amount of information about weather conditions existing at the time of observation over a large geographical area. They reveal in a few minutes what otherwise would take hours to describe. The United States Weather Bureau issues information about approaching storms, floods, frosts and all climatic conditions in general. Twice a month it issues a 30-day""outlook"" which is a rough guide to weather conditions likely to occur over broad areas of the United States. These 30-day outlooks are based upon an anaiysis of the upper air levels which often set the stage for development of air masses, fronts and storms. Considerable effort is being exerted today to achieve more accurate weather predictions, with identifying and tracking storms over regions which have but few meteorological stations. Extensive experiments are also in progress for weathef modification studies."	['shows things that would otherwise take hours to describe in a few minutes']

Which of the following may Oliver like best?	Jamie Oliver, a lively Britain guy, loves to share his secrets. In his first television show,The Naked Chef, Oliver taught everyone to make simple but delicious food. In Jamie's Kitchen, he taught young people how to prepare meals. His next show,Jamie's School Dinners, is about changing the food that students eat. Oliver saw that some schools in Britain were serving junk food--food that is easy to eat but unhealthy. Although it can be delicious, junk food is not very good for children. It is sometimes bad for their health, because it doesn't give them the energy they need at school. They sometimes can't think well or feel down, and they sometimes put on weight. Some of the junk food that Oliver wants to change is canned spaghetti, chicken nuggets, French fries, soda, and muffins. He encourages schools to serve fresh and health meats, vegetables and fruits. He helps the school cooks to make healthy dinners without junk food. People liked Oliver's idea of bringing quality food to schools. Thousands enjoyed his television show. But Oliver wanted them to do more than just watch. At hisFeed Me Betterwebsites, he collected over 270,000 signatures from people. Oliver sent these signatures to British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

According to the passage, which of the following in NOT true?	"Every time you go to the supermarket, you come away with your purchases in plastic bags. But wouldn't it be kinder to the environment if you asked for paper bags instead? The answer is not the easy as it might seem. Environmentalists say there are _ to using both plastic bags and paper bags. According to the American Plastics Council 80 percent of groceries in the US are packed in plastic bags. ""The numbers are becoming huge,"" said Vincent Cobb, a businessman from Chicago who set up ""reusable bags. com"" on the Internet. He notes that consumers use between 500 billion and 1 trillion plastic bags per year worldwide. Some experts believe that all these bags harm the environment. Plastic takes hundreds of years to break down and, as it does so, poisonous materials are released into the water and soil. Further damage is caused if plastic bags enter the sea. For example, endangered sea turtles cannot tell the bags from jellyfish , their main source of food, and often choke on them. Floating plastic bags have been spotted as far north as the Arctic Ocean and as far south as the southern end of South America. One expert predicts that, within ten years, plastic bags will wash up in Antarctica! However, this kind of bag does have its advantages. ""Plastic grocery bags are some of the most reused things around the house,"" explained Laurie Kusek of the American Plastics Council. According to the Film and Bag Federation, a trade group in the US plastics industry, paper bags use more energy and create more waste than plastic bags. Plastic bags require 40 per cent less energy to produce and cause 70 per cent less air pollution, the group explained. They also release as much as 94 percent less waste into the water than paper ones. But paper bags do break down more quickly than plastic bags. They don't endanger wildlife, either. So what should we do? One possible solution would be to use biodegradable plastic bags. But until biodegradable technology improves, it might be easier to pack things you buy in reusable cloth bags."

More black bears have appeared in the US because _ .	In recent years, the black bear population in the US has risen. Forests once cleared for farming have started to grow back and black bears have returned to them. But the bears are finding that their forest habitat has changed. Instead of thick forests covering thousands of acres, bears now have neighbors nearby. Roads, homes, schools, and shopping centers have been built at the edge of their forest home. And with humans and bears trying to share the same space, problems arise. Black bears usually prefer to avoid people, but their nose may lead them into trouble. Their normal diet includes nuts, insects, and plants. But given the opportunity, they will gladly help themselves to whatever they can find. With the great sense of smell, the bears can _ a tasty treat 2 or 3 miles away. Food left out in a park or backyard is an invitation to dinner. And whileraiding a cooler, bird feeder , trash can, car, or even a home, they can do a lot of damage. When that happens, people get angry. If another solution doesn't immediately appear, they often want the bears killed. Bear Aware, Bear Wise, and Bear Smart are trying to keep that from happening. They want people to respect bears, not fear them, and are suggesting ways to reduce the chances of bears stopping by for a snack. They're convincing people that by following some simple steps, it's possible to live peacefully with our wild neighbors.	['forests have increased in the US']
Reading poems is thought to be a social act in the nineteenth century because _ .	Reading poems is not exactly an everyday activity for most people. In fact, many people never read a poem once they get out of high school. It is worth reminding ourselves that this has not always been the case in prefix = st1 /America. In the nine-tenth century, a usual American activity was to sit around the fireside in the evening and read poems aloud. It is true that there was no television at the time, nor movie theaters, nor World Wide Web, to provide _ However, poems were a source of pleasure, of self - education, of connection to other people or to the world beyond one ' s own community. Reading them was a social act as well as an individual one, and perhaps even more social than individual. Writing poems to share with friends and relations was, like reading poems by the fireside, another way in which poetry has a place in everyday life. How did things change? Why are most Americans no longer comfortable with poetry , and why do most people today think that a poem has nothing to tell them and that they can do well without poems? There are, I believe, three factors: poets, teachers, and we ourselves. Of these, the least important is the third: the world surrounding the poem has betrayed us more than we have betrayed the poem. Early in the twentieth century, poetry in English headed into directions unfavor-able to reading of poetry. Readers decided that poems were not for the fireside or the easy chair at night, and that they belonged where other difficult-to-read things belonged. Poets failed the reader, so did teachers. They want their students to know something about the skills of a poem, they want their students to see that poems mean something. Yet what usually occurs when teachers push these concerns on their high school students is that young people decide poems are unpleasant crossword puzzles.	['it built a like among people']
Many Chinese people like to go to multinational chain restaurants because _ .	"In China, chain restaurants - especially the big multinational ones - are cool. Going to Starbucks, for example, is a status symbol. It not only says, ""I'm rich enough to buy this overpriced coffee,"" but also, ""I'm cosmopolitan enough to be part of globalization."" Where I come from in the UK, however, chains are neither fashionable nor gourmet . Chains are where you go on New Year's Day when nowhere else is open, or when you are 5 years old and your parents can't stand hearing, ""I'm huuuuuungry!"" any longer. In my own case (with regards to McDonald's), a chain is where you are taken on your first ""date"". Even at the age of 13, I knew to give the guy the ""let's just be friends"" phone call the next day. In the UK, independent cafes and restaurants are making a comeback on the fashion scene. Nowadays, a Londoner who says ""let's meet for a coffee at Monmouth"" (an independent cafe) is much cooler than one who says ""let's go to Starbucks"". Even if Monmouth's coffee is a little more expensive, there's a satisfaction in knowing your pounds aren't going straight to the big corporations. Of course, there are chain stores all over the UK; you can't go five minutes without spotting a Costa Coffee. But numbers do not add up to good taste. I do, however, have a confession . After moving to China I had moments when all the rice and Kung Pao Chicken became too much. I, too, have retreated to McDonald's."

Which is the best title for the passage?	"On December 26, a ten-year-old British schoolgirl, Tilly Smith, felt that something was wrong while she was on the beach with her family. Her mind kept going back to the geography lesson Mr. Kearney gave just two weeks before she flew to Thailand with her family. ""The water was swelling and kept coming in,"" said Tilly's mother. ""There was froth on it like you get on the top of a beer."" The Smiths were celebrating Christmas at Maikhao Beach in southern Thailand. Deadly tsunami waves were already on their way. There had been an earthquake not far away earlier that morning. The beach was getting smaller and smaller. Tilly's parents felt strange but they didn't know what was happening. Then Tilly said she'd just studied this at school. She told her parents that a tsunami was coming. In the end she screamed at everyone to get off the beach. Tilly's parents even didn't know what a tsunami was. Seeing their daughter so frightened, they thought that something serious must have been happening. Her parents soon took her and her seven-year-old sister back to the hotel. Many other tourists also left the beach with them. The family stayed on the third floor of their hotel. Fortunately, the hotel wasn't destroyed during the tsunami. Tilly's mother said that if they had stayed on the beach, they wouldn't have survived. After the disaster, the Smiths met people from nearby resorts who had lost their whole families. More than 100 people were saved because of Tilly's warning."	['A Ten-year-old Heroine']

The author took the story as an example in order to _ .	"If your parents take out a loan, remind themselves to make the payments on time. Otherwise it will become a negative record in their personal credit reports, which are playing an increasingly big role in people's daily lives. A story carried by Chongqing Morning Post in June, underlines this trend. According to the report, a Chongqing student borrowed money from the bank to finance his university studies. After he graduated in 2005, he went to work in Shenzhen. Later, he wanted to buy a house using loans. But several banks turned down his loan applications. The reason was that he had not paid back 1,500 yuan he borrowed from a bank when he was at university. A personal credit rating is becoming an essential ""pass"" in everyday life, as China establishes a nationwide credit database. Personal credit systems go back 150 years. In developed countries, enterprises and banks use them to decide whether or not to loan money or do other business with a person. A credit report estimates the credit worthiness of an individual, a company, or even a country. It is an evaluation made by credit bureaus of a borrower's overall credit history and his or her ability to repay debt. A poor credit rating means a high risk of defaulting on a loan, and thus leads to the refusal of a loan by the lender. Today in China, credit history in banks is the major content of a credit report. But in the future, reports will include information about the payment of telephone bills, water use fees, electricity and natural gas bills, and taxes, according to officials of the People's Bank of China, the central bank. Personal information such as appearance, genetic data, fingerprints, blood type, disease history, ethnic identity, family and religious beliefs are not to be included in credit reports, according to a draft regulation on credit rating issued last year by the Sate Council. The authors of the draft have just finished soliciting public opinions. The Credit Reference Center run by the People's Bank of China is in charge of developing a nationwide credit database. Credit reports for all people with bank transactions began in 2006. A personal credit rating is important to the social and economic activities of a person. According to the draft, if you have a personal negative credit record, it will be kept for five years."	['warn us of the importance of our personal credit report']
According to the passage, whether we go to a place or not depend on _ .	"When you were looking for a reliable, honest auto mechanize, how did you find him? Before you went into that restaurant you recently tried, how did you know that it served great good? If you are like most people on the planet, you want to lower your risk of a big ugly surprise so you asked people you trust to refer to a business they trust. Marketers call this friend-to friend recognition of business ""word-of -mouth advertising. When you do a treat job for your customer for a band job, people are going to talk about your business. Unfortunately, because we humans seem to feel negative emotions more intensively than positive ones, there're more likely to tell more of our friends about bad experiences with busyness than positive ones. Understand this: customer believes their own experience. You can't make them believed that your company is wonderful when they felt they were treated badly. So, to get positive word-of-mouth going for your business in this service- based economy, you've got to do a really outstanding job for everyone, exactly. And when you do, you build a great reputation. That takes time. But it forms a close link with your customers in a way that no advertising and no promotional coupon ever could. The good news is that because there are so many different businesses chasing after your customers' money, people want to know whom they can trust. So people are going to be talking about you.

The main purpose of the passage is to _	A new study suggests that listening to music in the office improves the speed and accuracy of tasks such as data entry, proof reading and problem solving. In an office-based experiment, 88 per cent of participants were found to produce their most accurate work when listening to music. The study also found that 81 per cent completed their fastest work when music was played. And it matters what type of music you listen to. For instance, if you're doing your tax returns, then classical music is the most effective as it improves maths skills. Listening to Jessie Jor Justin Bieber could also improve your speed, with 58 per cent of participants completing data entry tasks faster while listening to pop songs. During proof-reading, dance music, such as David Guetta, had the biggest positive impact with participants increasing their speed by 20 per cent compared to tests undertaken with no music at all. Dance music also had a positive effect on spell-checking with a 75 per cent pass rate compared to 68 per cent when no music was played at all. The research, undertaken by Brighton-based Mind lab International, suggests that silent offices may be the least productive. 'The Music Works experiment revealed a positive _ between music and productivity - overall it showed that when listening to music, nine out of 10 people performed better,' said Dr David Lewis, chairman of Mind lab International.

The author suggests that technical subjects _ .	University is generally regarded as one of the most important times in a person's life, yet the function of this institution continues to arouse debate. Many believe that arts subjects are too easy, that practical skills are more useful and that a chosen subject for study should be clearly linked to a career. However, this view is far too simplistic. Arts subjects are very difficult. They can prepare students for any number of careers as well as allowing the student to take time to make a decision. The function of the modern university is to cater to different types of student. Arts subjects are not easy. For example, a degree in Literature is not an easy option. No question in a Literature class has a single, simple answer. Debate is conducted in a spirit of openness, texts are very closely analyzed and skills in close reading are developed. Literature is about language, our primary means of communication. Arts subjects require the same concentrated study as any other subject. Arts subjects can prepare students for any number of careers. A degree in an arts subject teaches skills in well organized debates and defence of a position through the provision of evidence. These are applicable to many types of career. Law, for example. The point is that an undergraduate degree in any Arts subject trains the student in analysis and structure. Therefore, Arts graduates can pursue any number of careers. Arts subjects allow the student to take time to choose a career. Love of the subject for its own sake may well be the initial motivation for the Arts undergraduate but because the subject they have chosen is not so clearly linked to a career they have time to reflect, making a decision only when they are absolutely certain. Students who pursue Arts subjects therefore have the leisure to make a carefully considered choice. In conclusion, it is clear that Arts subjects are not a waste of time. They are flexible when it comes to relating them to a career and they allow the student to discover an appropriate career path. Many industries now acknowledge that a degree in Literature can be just as valuable as any other subject, especially when it is evident that Arts graduates tend to think more creatively. Not all undergraduates have clearly defined goals and not all subjects can be simply matched to a career. Acknowledging this difference should be the main function of a modern university	['have equal value to arts subjects.']
Sian Beilock points out that stress _ .	"Worrying about how you'll perform on a math test may actually contribute to a lower test score, US researchers said on Saturday. Math anxiety--feelings of dread and fear and avoiding math--can weaken the brain's limited amount of working capacity, a resource needed to calculate difficult math problems, said Mark Ashcrafi, a psychologist at the University of Nevada Las Vegas who studies the problem. ""It turns out that math anxiety occupies a person's working memory,"" said Ashcraft, who spoke at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Francisco. Ashcraft said while easy math tasks such as addition require only a small part of a person's working memory, harder calculations require much more. Worrying about math takes up a large part of a person's working memory stores as well, _ disaster for the anxious student who is taking a high-stakes test . Stress about how one does on tests like college entrance exams can make even good math students choke. ""All of a sudden they start looking for the short cuts,"" said University of Chicago researcher Sian Beilock. Although test preparation classes can help students get over this anxiety, they are limited to students whose families can afford them. Finally, she said, ""It may not be wise to rely completely on scores to predict who will succeed."" While the causes of math anxiety are unknown, Ashcraft said, ""People who manage to get over math anxiety have completely normal math ability."""

Online summer school is not suitable for _ .	"For most students, school is over and summer fun is here. Even kids who are going to summer school don't need to be cooped up indoors during these bright sunny days. Why? Thanks to technology, many kids now have the _ of attending ""virtual"" summer schools online. These ""virtual"" classes are not new. Many colleges and universities offer online courses where the students never meet; they correspond with their teachers and classmates on the web. Even some traditional schools add to daily classes with internet-based assignments and feedback. There are a lot of benefits to online schooling, and that's why public schools have started participating in this non-traditional type of education. Instead of students riding the bus, going to class, eating lunch at school, and going home in the early afternoon, they can now log on at any time of day or night and learn. This flexible online option requires just as much work and participation as normal summer school. However, the timing is different. Online summer school is not for all students, just like it isn't for all adults. The student needs to be an excellent reader in order to obtain as much information as possible from the lectures. In addition, students must understand computers and be self motivated in order to complete the class successfully. If the students meet these requirements, then online summer school has many advantages. Written lectures can be read and reread until the student understands them. The students can email each other and the teacher if they need help. Students who participate in online summer school often earn higher grades because the teachers can answer more questions without slowing down the entire class progress. And because of this new technology, summer school students can still go to the beach, travel around the world, and take family vacations!"	['students who are poor in reading']
When it comes to housing price in China, many _ think it reasonable.	"Housing Price in China has always aroused heated discussion among property developers and ordinary Chinese. To many property developers and local government officials, housing price in China is still low compared with many developed countries. However, the average housing price in the United States is only 8, 000 yuan per square metre, while in China, it is even higher than that in the United States. ""This shows that there are some bubbles in Chinese real estate market,"" the International Finance News reported. Although the average price of residential houses in the United States, after changed to RMB, is about 8, 000 yuan per square metre, the houses in the US are not sold in terms of building area, as most Chinese property developers do when they sell their houses. If the US property developers sell their houses according to the building area, then the housing price will be even lower than 8, 000 yuan per square metre. In most big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, houses are sold at a price even higher than those in the US. The high housing price in large cities in China proves that Chinese real estate market does have some bubbles. Moreover, Chinese houses cannot be compared with houses in the US in terms of building quality, environment and supporting facilities. Furthermore, it should be noted that American people's average income is several dozen times higher than that of Chinese people. How can the Chinese afford to buy a house which is even more expensive than that sold in the US? At the beginning of 2007, Chinese government issued a set of policies that aimed to benefit the public. Now in order to reduce the high housing prices, the government can regulate the real estate market by raising tax on property industry and controlling the release of loans and lands to property developers. Meanwhile, the government should allow people to build more houses through various fund-raising channels, such as funds collected from buyers or raised by working units. By applying these multiple means, it is expected that the high housing prices can be lowered and Chinese public can really benefit from the economic achievement."

What caused milk prices in California to increase?	The price of milk may be going up. There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st. California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices. The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell. The drought around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce the effect of the price rise here. The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing.	['Being short of rain.']
What is the similarity of the four hotels?	"Below is a selection about interesting hotels. Tayka Hotel de Sal Where: Tahua, Bolivia How much: About $95 a night Zxxk Why it's cool: You've stayed at hotels made of brick or wood, but salt? That's something few can claim. Tayka Hotel de Sal is made totally of salt - including the beds (though you'll sleep on regular mattresses and blankets). The hotel sits on the Salar de Uyuni, a prehistoric dried-up lake, which is the world's biggest salt flat. Builders use the salt from the 4,633-square-mile flat to make the bricks, and glue them together with a paste of wet salt that hardens when it dries. When there is big rain, the owners just mix up more salt paste to strengthen the bricks. Green Magic Nature Resort Where: Vythiri, India How much: About $240 a night Why it's cool: Taking a pulley -operated lift 86 feet to your treetop room is just the start of your adventure. As you look out of your open window - there is no glass! - you watch monkey and birds in the rain forest canopy . Later you might test your fear of heights by crossing the handmade rope bridge to the main part of the hotel, or just sit on your bamboo bed and read. You don't even have to come down for breakfast - the hotel will send it up on the pulley-drawn ""elevator"". Dog Bark Park Inn B&B Where: Cottonwood, Idaho How much: $92 a night Why it's cool: This doghouse isn't just for the family pet. _ is a 30-foot-tall dog with guest rooms in his belly. Climb the wooden stairs beside his hind leg to enter the door in his side. You can relax in the main bedroom, go up a few steps of the loft in Willy's head, or hang out inside his nose. Although you have a full private bathroom in your quarters, there is also a toilet in the 12-foot-tall fire hydrant outside. Gamirasu Cave Hotel Where: Ayvali, Turkey How much: Between $130 and $475 a night Why it's cool: This is caveman cool! Experience what it was like 5,000 years ago, when people lived in these mountain caves formed by volcanic ash. But your stay will be much more modern. Bathrooms and electricity provide what you expect from a modern hotel, and the white volcanic ash, called tufa, keeps the rooms cool, about 65*F in summer. (Don't worry - there is heat in winter.)"

The farmer didn't want to keep his horse any more because _ .	"A farmer had a faithful horse who was old and couldn't do much work. So the farmer no longer wanted to give him anything to eat and said, "" If you can bring me a lion here, I will keep you."" The horse was sad, and went to the forest. There he met a fox. After the fox heard the story, he said. ""I will help you. Just lie down, as if you were dead, and do not move.'' The horse did what the fox asked, and then the fox went to the lion and said, ""A dead horse is lying out there. Just come with me, and you have a rich meal."" The lion went with him, and they were both standing by the horse, the fox said, ""Now let me tie the horse to your tail and you can take it home and eat it."" The fox's words made the lion very happy. But the fox tied the lion's legs together with the horse's tail. When the fox finished his work, he said to the horse, ""Pull the lion to the farmer."" Then the horse pulled the lion away with him at once. The lion was very angry but he couldn't do anything. When the farmer saw the lion, he was in a good mood , and said to the horse, "" You can stay with me.'' And he give him enough food to eat until the horse died."

Which of the following can the students NOT learn in the activity?	"One day in April, a special activity called""Food Street""was held on the playground at Railway No. 1 Middle School in Xi'an. This activity was part of the English Art Festival in the school. The students in each class were divided into some groups. Each group sold different kinds of foods. The students did the shopping and the cooking all by themselves. The students cooked delicious food such as fried chicken, potato chips and vegetables. They all worked hard and sold the food at low prices. The customers were all the students, teachers and parents. They were all pleased with the nice food. ""It's really hard work,"" said one of the students who took part in the activity. ""We must make a plan before the cooking. We must know how much we should spend on the things we need. Also, we must learn how to serve customers well.""

At the beginning of the school year, kids are most probably _ .	One of the hardest things to do when you are a small child is to start school, and have a new teacher every year. I remember when I was in fourth grade, there were tons of rumors about my teacher. They said that he would hit kids with erasers. _ , and to this day I still remember him as one of those people who really helped me in life. One of the things that you can do to help your kids get ready for a new teacher is to go to meet him or her before the year starts. This allows students to know who the teacher is, and break the ice. It is common for students to be fearful of the teacher for the first few days. Maybe they look scary . However, as a parent, you need to teach your kids that teachers are people too, and that they want nothing but the best for you in life. If your child is still having trouble adjusting to a teacher, you could ask your child to be taught by a different teacher. Adjusting to teachers can be an uncertain thing for a young child. Whether your child knows nothing about this person, or maybe he has heard a rumor about him, it can be a scary thing. As a parent, all you can do is to make sure that your children know the teacher is there to help, not be scary.	['fearful']
Which of the following is NOT true?	In China, more and more middle school students are getting shorter sleeping time than before. Most students sleep less than nine hours every night, because they have much homework to do. Some homework is given by their teachers, and some by their parents. Also, some students don't know how to save time. They are not careful enough while they do their homework, so it takes them a lot of time. Some students spend too much time watching TV or playing computer games. They stay up very late. Some students have to get up early every morning on weekdays to go to school in time by bus or by bike. It may be a long way from home to school. Schools and parents should cut down some of the homework so that our children can enjoy more than nine hours of sleep every night for their health. For children, we should make best use of our time. When we have enough time for sleeping, we will find it much better for both our study and health.	['All the students stay up late for their homework.']

According to the passage, we might get angry when someone _ .	Is there someone you hate? Well, maybe you don't really hate them. But you get really angry every time you think of them. If you don't let this anger go, it can turn into bitterness Bitterness appears when we can't forgive someone who has hurt us or made us angry. Someone might say or do something that hurts us. But Instead of controlling the anger, we keep it deep inside. Before long, a bitter feeling begins to grow. We may think we're hurting that person by criticizing him or her often, but we're really only hurting ourselves. Bitterness can not only lead to serious health problems such as heart disease, but also hurt our relationships with friends and family members. No one enjoys being around an anger person for very long. If you see bitterness in your life, here are some ways to deal with it. Accept it Instead of trying to your anger, make it clear to yourself and accept it. See your anger for what it is and quickly deal with it. Stop making excuses for it You may feel you have a right to be anger. You may think you're right and the other person is wrong. You may even secretly enjoy making the other person look bad. But in the end, bitterness hurts you much more than the other person. The bitterness will hold you back, and the other person will go on with his or her life. Forgive and forget it You probably can't completely put the anger out of your mind. But you can decide to forgive the other person. Forget it and move on. You'll enjoy better health and peace of mind. ,,	['does hurt us']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"My summer hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2 go 2 NY 2C my bro, his GF & thr 3 : -@ kids FTF. ILNY; its gr8. Can you understand this sentence? If you can't, don't feel too bad. The middle school teacher in England who received this as homework couldn't either. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or mobile phones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the ""translation"" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great. Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. ""People get better at writing by writing,"" he says, ""Kids who are now doing text messaging and e-mail will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents."" Linguist James Milroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become ""corrupted"", and that they simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia Mcvey says, ""I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future."" Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, ""I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun."""

Toys are needed to keep these sick children happy and quiet. Money for them can be sent to the hospital. After Mrs. Weeks read the story, she said,""This story gave me an idea.""

According to the passage, the adjustable steel bar can help the students keep their eyes _ from books.	"A primary school in Wuhan has used new desks and chairs to prevent students from getting short sight. The desks and chairs make students have the correct posture, especially when reading and writing. Each desk has an adjustable steel bar. The bar can help students keep their eyes at least 30cm from books. Zhang Jianming is headmaster of the primary school. She said the new desks and chairs were provided by an eye care centre in the city. The school carried out a survey last September. It showed that about 7 percent of its 1,093 students said they suffered from short sight. The new desks and chairs have already improved the students' posture, but both teachers and students might need more time to get used to them. Yang Lihua is head of the Wuhan Youth Eye Care Center. She said the desks and chairs were introduced to 19 schools on a trial basis. ""During our research into short sight, we noticed that the number of students with short sight was increasing. This is because parents are teaching their children to read and write at a very early age without paying enough attention to their posture,"" she said. Feng Junying is a doctor at Beijing Jingshan School. ""I think the new desks and chairs in Wuhan will certainly be helpful,"" she said. ""But bad reading habits at school are not the only reason for short sight. Children are using mobile phones and iPads when they are very young. This can be another reason for short sight at a young age."""	['32cm']
Who is the text written for?	A great way for teens to cool off during the summer is at water parks. If you live near a water park, you might think about getting a season pass. This way you can go as often as you like. Check to see if there are any water parks around you. Many are indoor facilities. So even if it isn't warm enough where you live to swim outdoors, you can enjoy swimming in a temperature controlled area. The prices are usually good. For example, one ticket to Water World, a water park, is only $5. Some teens like to get a part time job over the summer to make some pocket money. Older teens shouldn't have much trouble finding jobs. An idea is to get some teens together to form your own summer job business. You can walk dogs, bring in the newspapers, feed the cats, collect rubbish, water flowers, etc. Being that it's summer, many people go on vacation and could use someone to look after their houses while they're away. You can also think about other jobs you can do for them. Teens love freedom. Sure you would like to get to such places as the small, movie theaters, the zoo, the beach, picnic, bowling and local amusement park instead of staying home all summer. Then a summer bus pass will be helpful. Check to see if your area has one for you teens. Such a pass costs only $10 for the whole summer. The price is reasonable and also your parents don't have to always drive.	['Teens']
Why do you have to be careful of what you write?	"Most people are writing blogs . Others are reading them. The word "" blog"" is a short way of saying Web log almost like QQ Zone . Many popular Web sites now offer free, easy ways to create personal Web pages and fill them with writings and pictures. Blogs offer people a place to show their writings and feelings over the Internet. They can also be helpful to connect people with others. A blog has both good and bad points, of course. People choose to write what they think in blogs, for they know that their friends will read what they write. If you are feeling sad one day and write your feelings in your blog, your friends may quickly write back to _ you or offer their help. Blogs help people keep good friendship and let them know what their friends are doing. But the problem is that anyone can read what you write in your blog. If you are not satisfied with a friend during school, and you write something bad about him in your blog, your friend read the blog and get angry. So we have to be careful of what we write. In many ways, a blog and a diary are almost the same. So what makes a blog different from a diary? The biggest difference is that a blog is more public than a diary."

It is very important for teenagers to have one good friend or a group of friends in their lives. Even when they are not with their friends, they usually spend a lot of time talking among(......) them on the phone. This communication is very important in children's growing up, because friends can discuss something. These things are difficult to say to their family members in fact.

The boy caught a mockingbird because _ .	"Watching some children trying to catch butterflies one hot August afternoon, I was reminded of an incident in my own childhood. When I was a boy of 12 in South Carolina, something happened to me that cured me forever of wanting to put any wild creature in a cage. We lived on the edge of a wood, and every evening at dusk the mockingbirds would come and rest in the tree and sing. There isn't a musical instrument made by man that can produce a more beautiful sound than the song of the mockingbird. I decided that I would catch a young bird and keep it in a cage and that way have my own private musician. I finally succeeded in catching one and put it in a cage. At first, in its fright at being captured, the bird fluttered about the cage, but eventually it settled down in its new home, I felt very pleased with myself and looked forward to some beautiful singing from my tiny musician. I had left the cage out on our back porch , and on the second day of the bird's captivity my new pet's mother flew to the cage with food in her mouth . The baby bird ate everything she brought to it. I was pleased to see this. Certainly the mother knew better than I how to feed her baby. The following morning when I went to see how my captive was doing, I discovered it on the floor of the cage, dead. I was shocked! What had happened? I had taken excellent care of my little bird, or so I thought. Arthur Wayne, the famous _ , happened to be visiting my father at the time and, hearing me crying over the death of my bird, explained what had occurred: ""A mother mockingbird, finding her young in a cage, will sometimes bring it poison berries. She thinks it better for her young to die than to live in captivity."" Never since then have I caught any living creature and put it in a cage. All living creatures have a right to live free."

According to the text, Tesla Autopilot _ .	"You know how much your telephone has changed over the past 10 years? Your car will change even more than that in the next 10 years. One of the biggest changes is that cars will drive themselves. ""We certainly have the technology for it now.""says Andrew Poliak of automotive technology supplier QNX.""We expect self-driving cars to be a mainstream thing between 2020 and 2025."" The American company Google has been working on self-driving cars for years. These cars are already on the roads in the United States and are truly self-driving. They have to steering wheels or pedals . Last week, the police ordered one of Google's cars to stop for driving too slowly on a public road. The car was not breaking any law, so no one was punished. Another American company, Tesla, added an ""Autopilot"" feature to its cars last month. With the Autopilot turned on, the vehicle drives itself. The car will speed up, slow down, _ and drive by itself. You can take over driving any time by turning the steering wheel or touching a pedal. The car uses sensors to know when driveway changing is safe and whether it should speed up or slow down. Tesla Autopilot is made for cross-country driving. It keeps you in the driveway and helps you avoid hitting other cars. It does not work well on local roads, for it will not stop at a red light or stop sign. Reporter Carolyn Nicander Mohr tried the Autopilot feature of a Tesla earlier this month. She had a hard time trusting the car to do what it should do. She thought about disabling the Autopilot feature many times during her trip. She wanted to take control at every bend in the road and hit the brake when the car in front of her slowed down. Yet the car drove perfectly. Other companies are working on self-driving cars, too. Marcedes-Benz, Audi, BMW.Volvo and Toyota all have plans for such vehicles. ,A, B, C, D."

Which of the following events influenced people's table manners most according to the article?	"Whether you're eating at a fancy restaurant or dining in someone's home. Proper table manners are likely to help you make a good impression. According to a US expert, Emily Post, ""All rules of table manners are made to avoid ugliness."" While Henry Hitchings of the Los Angeles Times admits that good manners can reduce social conflict, he points out that mostly their purpose is protective - they turn our natural warrior-like selves into more elegant ones. So where did table manners come from? In medieval England, a writer named Petrus Alfonsi took the lead to urge people not to speak with their mouths full. And King David I of Scotland also proposed that any of his people who learned to eat more neatly be given a tax deduction . Disappointingly, that idea never _ . It was during the Renaissance, when there were real technical developments, opinions of correct behavior changed for good. ""None of these was more significant than the introduction of the table fork,"" wrote Hitchings. ""Gradually, as forks became popular, they brought the new way of eating, making it possible, for instance, to consume berries without making one's fingers dirty."" Forks were introduced to Britain in 1608 and 25 years later, the first table fork reached America. Yet while most of the essentials are the same on both sides of the Atlantic, there are a few clear differences between what's normal in the US and what holds true in the UK. For example, in the US, when food needs cutting with a knife, people generally cut a bite, then lay aside the knife and switch the fork to their right hand. Then they pick up one bite at a time. By contrast, Britons keep the fork in the left hand and don't lay the knife down. Though globalization has developed a new, simpler international standard of table manners, some people still stick with the American cut-and-switch method.The Los Angeles Times noted, ""They are hanging on to a form of behavior that favors manners above efficiency."""

The father was _ , ""If you asked f or the money to buy a toy or some other rubbish, the go straight to your room and think about why are you so selfish !"" The little boy went to his room no words and shut the door. After a short while, the father calmed down, and started to think, ""Maybe he really needs to buy something and he didn't really ask for money very often."" So he went to the little boy's room. ""Sorry!Maybe I was too hard on your just now."" said the man, ""Here's $10."" ""Oh, thank you Daddy!"" he said happily. Then the boy took out some coins. When the father found that the boy already had money, he got angry again. ""Why do you want more money since you already have some?"" the father shouted angrily.

What will you do to your friends according to the passage?	"Put a little love in your life I remember growing up, my mom always said, ""Half the fun of doing anything is sharing it with others."" It is so true. Friends and mates allow us to enjoy our success and our joys, comfort us in our challenging moments, and provide a mirror for us to learn more about ourselves. I've always looked at friends as the family we choose. They enrich our lives. As Robert Louis Steven once said, ""A friend is a present which you give yourself."" To be a good friend or partner, it's importable be a good listener. Hear what your friend or mate has to say first rather than jumping to conclusions or getting defensive. Sometimes it is useful to be their mirror, for when they hear their words repeated back to them, it can help them to realize that what they said was not exactly what they meant to say. Patience, compassion and empathy are also important traits in being a good friend or partner. You know the old golden rule, ""Care for others the way you would like them to care for you."" The support of a friend during a tough time could make the difference between success and failure. Encouragement and confidence are priceless gifts that can help change a person's life. Take care, though, with whom you choose to have close relationship, for they can have a tremendous impact on your self-esteem and life path. As someone once told me,""the attitude of your friends are like the buttons on an elevator. They will either take you up or down."""	['Give them encouragement and confidence.']
What can infer from Shiff that _ .	"Many Americans spend more time in cars these days than in the kitchen. But as lives grow busier--and waistlines grow larger--a number of health experts are calling for Americans to reduce their risk of cancer and other diseases by cooking at home more and eating out less. ""When dining out, people are likely to _ all the wrong thing,"" says Rachel Brandeis of the American Dietetic Association. ""People take in 50% more fat and sodium when they eat out than when they cook at home. And they often miss out on fruits, vegetables and other vitamin-rich 'powerhouse foods' that may reduce the risk of cancer."" Nutritionists know it's not easy to break old habits. Many people say they hardly have time to exercise, let alone fix dinner. Brandeis says her secret is organization. She cooks six nights a week, even though she and her husband both work. She spends 20 minutes thinking about a week's worth of menus and writing a list. She shops just once a week. Brandeis says she chooses easy cooking methods, too. Since she is not quite good at cooking. The American Institute for Cancer Research has produced a guide filled with tips like ""Homemade for Health"". Melanie Polk, the institute's director of nutrition education, says cooking at home has many advantages. It teaches children about nutrition as well as the importance of sharing housework. The 39-year-old homemaker Kirstin Kristinus of Washington, D.C. says cooking at home brings her family together. She also tries to reduce her family's cancer risk by preparing every meal with many different kinds of food. ""The only way to know that you are getting all the good things is to expose yourself to a wide variety of food,"" says Steven Shiff, a doctor in New Jersey. ""If you eat out at a restaurant, it's a lot easier to choose unhealthful things."" However, ""families don't have to give up restaurants,"" Shiff says. ""It is possible to eat healthfully if you eat outside the home. But it takes probably the same sort of planning that you would have to do to prepare meals at home."""

The text is mainly about _ .	"Parents do need to teach their kids financial responsibility and that money is earned. Still, many child-development experts agree that tying a child's allowance to chores can be a slippery slope. Here's why. Susie Walton, master instructor at Peace in Your Home advises to keep chores and allowances totally separate. ""Allowance is one thing. When it comes to chores, life skills, responsibilities-that's a whole different thing."" says Walton. Walton says, ""When kids aren't doing a chore, you don't say, 'well, there goes your allowance.' You're going to sit them down and ask what's going on. 'We are a team. We are a family. We've got to have them done.'"" Besides, by paying children for chores with an allowance, you'll also be sending the message that work isn't worth doing unless they're getting paid for it. There are times when it would make sense to pay kids for chores. Most financial and child-development experts agree that it's a fine idea to pay children money for extra jobs that are outside their normal set of chores, such as washing windows, washing the car or helping to clean out the garage-especially if the child is saving for a big item. This may even develop an entrepreneurial spirit to think outside of the box to earn money. For parents who are concerned that their children won't learn the value of a dollar if the allowance isn't tied to household chores, note that there are still plenty of money management skills to be learned from a straight allowance. Depending on the age, kids can be made responsible for paying for their own toys or snacks. Some parents even require that kids set aside a percentage of their allowance toward savings. ""I really like having my own money,"" says Kevin, 9. ""It's up to me if I want to buy the cheap toy now, or save and get the better toy."" And that's a good lesson to learn at 9 years old.

Using this language, they could share thoughts and ideas with others. The language they used was a language without sound. It was a sign language. How did this sign language work? The deaf learnt to make certain movements with their hands, faces and bodies. These movements stood for things and ideas. People might move their forefingers across their lips. This meant ""you are not telling the truth"". They might tap their chin with three fingers. This meant ""my uncle"". The deaf learned to see a finger alphabet. They used their fingers to make the letters of the alphabet. In this way, they spelled out words. Some deaf people could spell out words at a speed of 130 words per minute. The deaf don't use the sign language and finger spelling as much as they once were. Today, the deaf learn to understand others by watching their lips. They also learn how to speak."

Why did the boy always carry his gun with him wherever he went?	I knew I was all right now. Nobody else would come ahunting after me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods. I made a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain couldn't get at them. I caught a catfish and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper. When it was dark I sat by my camp fire, feeling pretty satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, so I went and sat on the bank and listened to the current crashing along, and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that came down, and then went to bed; there was no better way to _ when you are lonesome; you can't stay so, and you soon get it over. And so for three days and nights. No difference--just the same thing. But the next day I went exploring around the island. I was boss of it; it all belonged to me, and I wanted to know all about it; but mainly I wanted to spend the time. I found plenty of strawberries and green summer grapes; and the green blackberries were just beginning to show. Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I wasn't far from the foot of the island. I had my gun along, but I had shot nothing; it was for protection. About this time I almost stepped on a goodsized snake, and it moved quietly and smoothly through the grass and flowers, and I was after it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking. My heart jumped up among my lungs. I never waited to look further, but unlocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as I could. Every now and then I stopped a second among the thick leaves and listened, but my breath came so hard that I couldn't hear anything else. I moved quietly along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on. If I saw a stump , I took it for a man; if I stepped on a stick and broke it, it made me feel that a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too. There was no time to be fooling around. When getting to the camp, I got all my traps into my canoe again to have them out of sight. I put out the fire and threw the ashes around to look like an old last year's camp, and then climbed a tree. I suppose I was up for two hours; but I didn't see or hear anything--I only thought I heard and saw as much as a thousand things. Well, I couldn't stay up there forever, so at last I got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast.

Frank Furedi believes that _ .	"All schoolchildren should have ""happiness"" lessons up to the age of 18 to combat growing levels of depression, according to a senior government adviser. ""Pupils should study subjects such as how to manage feelings, attitudes to work and money, channeling negative emotions and even how to take a critical view of the media,"" said Lord Richard Layard, a Labor peer and professor of economics at the London School of Economics. The proposal comes only days after the Government said that lessons in manners--including respect for the elderly and how to say ""please"" and ""thank you""--should be taught in secondary schools to combat bad behavior. Lord Layard, the director of the wellbeing program at the LSE's Center for Economic Performance, said: ""Learning hard things takes an enormous amount of practice. To play the violin well takes 10,000 hours of practice. How can we expect people to learn to be happy without large amounts of practice and repetition?"" It is believed that at least two percent of British children under 12 now struggle with significant depression. Among teenagers, the figure rises to five percent. A UNICEF study involving 21 developed countries showed that British children were the least satisfied with their lives, while the World Health Organization predicts that childhood psychiatric disorders will rise by 50 percent by 2020. In a speech at Cambridge University, Lord Layard said the Government's lessons in manners did not go far enough. ""We need a commitment to producing a major specialism in this area, with a serious teacher training program,"" he said. However, happiness lessons have been criticized by academics. Frank Furedi, a sociology professor at Kent University and author of Therapy Culture, said: ""In pushing emotional literacy, what some teachers are really doing is abandoning teaching. They are giving up and talking about emotions instead, so that children value all this non-discipline-led activity more than maths, English or science. What is amazing about this is that time and time again, research says that it does not work."""	['formal teaching should not give way to happiness lessons']

A few days after he became a _ the man's parents and his past wife's parents came to visit the family. ''We've been talking' they said,'' about how to take care of all these children and work to make a living. So, we've arranged for each child to be placed with a different uncle or aunt. We're making sure that here in the neighborhood, so you can see them at any time'' ''you have no idea how much I appreciate your thoughtfulness.' The man said .''But I want you to know,'' he smiled and continued, '' if the children affect my work or if we should need any help, we'll let you know.'' Over the next few weeks, the man worked with his children, assigning them small work and giving them responsibilities. But then another misfortune happened. The man got a disease-- arthritis. His hands swelled, and he was unable to catch the handles of his farm tools. The children did their work well, but the man could see that he would not be able to continue the work on his farm, He sold his farming equipment, moved the family to a small town, and opened a small business, The family was welcomed into the new neighborhood. The man's business flourished soon. He got pleasure from seeing people and serving them. Word of his pleasant personality and good customer service began to spread in the town. People came from far and wide to do business with him, and the children helped both at home and at work, Their father's pleasure in his work brought courage to them and the father got pleasure from their success. The children grew up and got married. Five of the seven went to college and then they were married. Each one paid his or her own way. The children's success in school was a source of pride to the father, as he had stopped at the sixth grade .Then came grandchildren .No one enjoyed grandchildren more than this man. As they became older, he invited them to his workplace and his small home .They brought each other great joy finally, the youngest daughter, the baby, who had been two years old at her mother's death, got married. And the man, his life's work completed, died. This man's work had been the lonely but joyful task of raising his family. This man was my father. I was the 16-year-old one, the oldest of the seven.

What shouldn't you do when you are on line?	Many children use the Internet to get useful knowledge and information, and to relax in their free time. But some of them are not using it in a good way. Here are some rules to make sure you are safe and have fun on the Internet. Make rules for Internet use with your parents. For example, when you can go online, for how long and what activities you can do online. Don't give your password to anyone else, and never give out the following information: your real name ,home address, age, school, phone number or other personal information. Check with your parents before giving out a credit card number. Never send a photo of yourself to someone in e-mail unless your parents say it's OK. Check with your parents before going into a chat room. Different chat rooms have different rules and attract different kinds of people. You and your parents will want to make sure it's a right place for you. Never agree to meet someone you met on the Internet without your parent's permission. Never meet anyone you met online alone. Always remember that people online may not be who they say they are. Treat everyone online as if they were strangers. If something you see or read online makes you uncomfortable, leave the site. Tell a parent or a teacher right away. Treat other people as you'd like to be treated. Never use bad language. Remember that not everything you read on the Internet is true.	['Using bad language.']
Divorce results in all the following problems except that _ .	In the United States, the number of children affected by divorce grows by about one million each year. As the number increases, experts continue to debate the effects of divorce on children. Some experts say divorce is harmful to children. Some studies show that children of divorce have more problems. For example, some children of divorce are more often aggressive toward parents and teachers. They have a greater risk of leaving school before completing their studies. They have more health and learning problems. However, experts note that these problems are not necessarily caused by divorce alone. During the 1970's, many Americans believed that divorce was the best solution for married people who were not happy. People did not think divorce would harm children. They thought children would go through a period of change when their parents ended their marriage. Then the children would be all right. These beliefs have changed in recent years. Researcher Judith Wallerstein studied more than one hundred children of divorce over a twenty-five-year period. She says some children never recover from divorce. She says they often have problems with their own adult relationships as a result of their parents' divorce. Ms. Wallerstein says her study proves that parents should stay together for their children, even if they are unhappy. However, some people say that children suffer more in a situation where there is much conflict. They say it is better for children to live with one divorced parent than to live with two parents who are angry and unhappy. Other experts note that many children of divorce do not have serious problems. This is because their parents are able to deal with the situation in a responsible way. Experts say that some people who get divorced are able to put the needs of their children first. They say that they are able to show the children that their love and support will continue after the divorce.	['the children may experience more pressure from society']
If you want to write to someone in Edinburgh that lies in Scotland, you should write the address as _ .	"Did anyone find the names of ""Great Britain"", ""the United Kingdom"", ""England"" and ""the British commonwealth"" which have the same meaning? Strictly speaking, these names all refer to something different. None of them are exactly the same as any of the others. The British isles refer to the main islands and several thousand small ones as well, which you can see on the map. Great Britain, or Britain, refers to the larger of the two main islands. But the word ""Britain"" is often used as a short form for the United Kingdom or you call it the UK. Now as for England, it refers simply to the largest of the three countries on the island of Great Britain. The United Kingdom is the name of the state and the official name of the country, which many people popularly refer to England. Finally, the Britain commonwealth is the usual name for what is left of the British Empire . This change shows the weakening of British Empire and the rising of the national liberation movements throughout the world today."	['Edinburgh, Scotland ,Great Britain']
Which of the following can a parent say to his children to show that one's opinion does not reflect reality?	"Remind children that bad things don't last. It may sound simple, but the message is extremely important. ""Children often don't have the experience to know that when something bad happens---they lose an important game or their best friend lets them down---it's not the end of the world,"" explains Nancy Leffert, a senior research scientist with the Research Institute, an American adolescents and children's research group. ""They think their bad feelings will last for ever, or that one failure will ruin everything."" Unfortunately, that kind of thinking discourages motivation . ""If a child believes that the cause of her upset is lasting, or that nothing she does will make a difference, it decreases her ability to keep on trying."" says Dorothy Rich, president of the MegaSkills Education Center of the Home and School Institute, based in Washington. Any time you can help your child see that a situation is not lasting, that a result can be changed, or that one opinion does not reflect reality, you give her reason to hope. Case in point: ""When my daughter Kathy was eight, art was one of her favorite subjects,"" says Beth, a mother of two. ""Then she got an art teacher who gave a great deal of praise to one student and barely noticed the rest. Kathy was ready to give up until I explained to her, ""Never stop doing your best just because one person doesn't give you praise."" Beth had to repeat the advice often, and finally her daughter got the message. ""Kathy is 12 now, and art is still one of her strongest subjects."""	"['""That may be what your teacher thinks, but I see it differently.""']"
Which of the following is Not True?	"Jack is a twelve-year-old boy. One day, he was playing football. The ball went into the street and Jack ran for it. Unfortunately, a car hit him. Jack's parents took him to the hospital at once. Jack woke up after a month. When he woke up, he asked, ""Who am I? Who are you? Why am I here?"" He even didn't know his parents. The doctor said, ""Jack's head was badly hurt. Maybe he can remember all the things he has lost one day. Maybe he will forget them forever."" Every day Jack's parents told Jack something about himself, his friends and so on. But Jack still couldn't think of anything. One day, when his father talked about his dog, Tidy, Jack seemed to think of something. Then Jack's father had an idea. He took Jack back home. Jack and Tidy played together happily. After a year, with the help of Tidy, Jack's memory came back."	['The doctor was sure that Jack could be cured one day.']
Global warming is an important cause of koalas' reduction because _ .	"Australia's koalas could die out within 30 years unless immediate action is taken to stop the losing in population, according to researchers. They say development, climate change and bushfires have all combined to reduce the number of wild koalas sharply. The Australian Koala Foundation said a recent survey showed the population could have dropped by more than half in the past six years. The number of koalas was once estimated to be more than 100,000, but now is as few as 43,000. The foundation collected field data from 1,800 sites and 80,000 trees to calculate the numbers. In one area in northern Queensland estimated to have 20,000 koalas a decade ago, a team of eight people could not find a single animal in four days of searching. The foundation said besides problems caused by cutting down forests, hotter and drier conditions because of global warming had reduced the nutritional value of their main food, eucalyptus leaves, leading to poor nutrition for them. Koalas, which live in the forests in Australia's east and south, are very picky about what types of the leaves they eat. Foundation chief Deborah Tabart said: ""The koalas are missing everywhere we look. It's really no tree, no me. If you keep cutting down trees you don't have any koalas.""She is hoping the new figures will persuade the government's Threatened Species Steering Committee (TSSC) to list the koala as threatened. But committee chairman Bob Beeton said a decision was not likely recently and the koala's status as one of the country's favorite animals would not be a factor. ""There's a number of species which are attractive and people have special feelings towards them. We don't consider that,"" Mr Beeton said."	['the leaves koalas eat are losing nutritional value']
What can we learn from the passage?	"Mr Stilwell looked out of his window. There was a boy at the other side of the street. The boy sat before a store and took some bread out of a bag and then began eating it. There was a very thin dog in the street too. The boy said to it very kindly. ""Come here, good dog. Do you want a piece of bread?"" The dog was very hungry and went to the boy, but he didn't give it any of his bread. Instead, he kicked the dog. It ran away and the boy laughed. Then Mr Stilwell came out of his house and said to the boy, ""Do you want a dollar?"" The boy was happy and said, ""Yes, I do."" ""Come here,"" Mr Stilwell said. The boy went to Mr. Stilwell, but Mr Stilwell didn't give him a dollar. Instead, he hit him with a stick. The boy cried and said, ""Why did you hit me? I didn't ask you for any money."" ""No,"" Mr. Stilwell said, ""and the dog didn't ask you for any bread, but you kicked it."""	['We should never play tricks   on others.']
Which of the following statements is TRUE?	You're probably aware of the basic trends. The financial rewards to education have increased over the past few decades, but men fail to benefit. In elementary and high school, male academic performance is lagging. Boys earn three-quarters of the D's and F's. By college, men are clearly behind. Only 40 percent of bachelor's degree go to men, along with 40 percent of master's degree. Thanks to their lower skills, men are dropping out of the labor force. In 1954, 96 percent of the American men between the ages of 25 and 54 worked. Today, that number is down to 80 percent. In Friday's jobs report, male labor force participation reached an all-time low. Millions of men are collecting disability benefits. Even many of those who do have a job are doing poorly. According to Michael Greenstone of the Hamilton Project, annual earnings for average prime-age males have dropped by 28 percent over the past 40 years. Men still dominate the top of the corporate ladder because many women take time off to raise children, but women lead or are gaining nearly everywhere else. Women in their 20s outearn men in their 20s. Twelve out of the 15 fastest-growing professions are dominated by women. Over the years, many of us have employed a certain theory to explain men's economic decline. It is that the information-age economy rewards qualities that women are more likely to possess. To succeed today, you have to be able to sit still and focus attention in school at an early age. You have to be emotionally sensitive and aware of context. You have to communicate smoothly. For genetic and cultural reasons, many men are not good at these. But, in her fascinating new book, The End of Men, Hanna Rosin suggests a different theory. It has to do with adaptability. Women, Rosin argues, are like immigrants who have moved to a new country. They see a new social context, and they flexibly adapt to .new circumstances. Men are like immigrants who have physically moved to a new country but who have kept their minds in the old one. They speak the old language. They follow the old customs. Men are more likely to be rigid; women are more fluid. This theory has less to do with born qualities and more to do with social position. When there's big social change, the people who were on the top of the old order are bound to stick to the old ways. The people who were on the bottom are bound to experience a burst of energy. They are going to explore their new surroundings more enthusiastically. Rosin reports from working-class Alabama. The women she meets are flooding into new jobs and new opportunities -- going back to college, pursuing new careers. The men are waiting around for the jobs left and are never coming back. They are strangely immune to new options. In the Auburn-Opelika region, the average female income is 140 percent of the average male income. Rosin is not saying that women are winners in a global gender war or that they are doing super simply because men are doing worse. She's just saying women are adapting to today's economy more flexibly than men. There's a lot of evidence to support her case. A study by the National Federation of Independent Business found that small businesses owned by women outperformed male-owned small business during the last recession . In finance, women who switch firms are more likely to see their performance improve, whereas men are likely to see theirs decline. There's even evidence that women are better able to adjust to divorce. Today, more women than men see their incomes rise by 25 percent after a marital breakup. Forty years ago, men and women stuck to certain theory, what it meant to be a man or a woman. Young women today, Rosin argues, have abandoned both feminist and prefeminist preconceptions. Men still stick to the masculinity rules, which limit their vision and their movement. If she's right, then men will have to acknowledge that they are strangers in a strange land.

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	This March, the H7N9 virus hit Zhejiang, Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu and so on. It seemed that most people who were infected with H7N9 had the common flu. Some people suffered from a fever or a cough. Don't be afraid---it's not easy to be infected with the virus. Here is some advice to help you protect yourself when it comes. Wash your hands. You need to wash your hands with soap and hot water before you eat, after you use the toilet , and after you touch animals, because your hands may carry viruses. Cover your nose and mouth, when someone sneezes or coughs, flu viruses can travel as far as one meter through the air, so you'd better stand a proper distance while talking to someone who has a cold. And always cover your nose and mouth with a piece of paper when you sneeze or cough, and then clean your hands. Wear a mask . Some doctors say that masks can stop the flu as much as 80%, but if you don't wash your hands often, it's no use wearing a mask. And it's necessary to wear a mask in the groups of people. Do sports often. Exercise will help your body strong enough to _ the virus.	['You should cover your mouth and nose with a piece of paper when you sneeze or cough.']

The tears flowed freely when the writer entered the dining room because _ .	"In the dining room of my grandfather's house stood a massive grandfather clock. Meals in that dining room were a time for four generations to become one. The table was always spread with food containing love as the main ingredient . And that grandfather clock stood like an old family friend, watching over the laughter that was a part of our lives. As a child, the old clock fascinated me. I watched and listened to it during meals. Even more wonderful to me was my grandfather's ritual. He wound that clock with a special key carefully each day. That key was magic to me. It kept our family's magnificent clock ticking and chiming. I remember watching as my grandfather took the key from his pocket and opened the hidden door in the clock. He inserted the key and wound -- not too much, nor too little. He never let that clock wind down and stop. He showed us grandchildren how to open the door and let us each take turns winding the key. I remember the first time I did it I was so excited to be part of this family ritual. After my grandfather died, it was days after the funeral before I remembered the clock! ""Mama! The clock! We've let it wind down."" The tears flowed freely when I entered the dining room. The clock stood there quiet. It even seemed smaller without my grandfather's special touch. Some time later, my grandmother gave me the clock and the key. The old house was quiet. No laughter over the dinner table, no ticking or chiming of the clock -- all was still. I took the key in my shaking hand and opened the clock door. All of a sudden, I was a child again, watching my grandfather with his silver-white hair and blue eyes. He was there, winking at me, at the secret of the clock's magic, at the key that held so much power. I stood, lost in the moment for a long time. Then slowly and carefully I inserted the key and wound the clock. I sprang to life. Tick -- Tock, tick -- tock, life and chimes were breathed into the dining room, into the house and into my heart. In the movement of the hands of the clock, my grandfather lived again."	['the writer missed Grandfather']

According to the passage, what is a child's greatest dissatisfaction?	How often one hears children wishing they were grown up, and the old wishing they were young again! Each age has its pleasure and its pains, and the happiest person is the one who enjoys what each age gives him without wasting any time in useless regrets. Children is a time when there are few duties to make life hard. If a child has good parents, he is fed, looked after, and loved whatever he may do. It's impossible for him to be given so much again in his life without having to do anything in return. Besides, life is always giving new things to the child. A child finds pleasure in playing in the rain, or in the snow. His first visit to the seaside makes him wild. But a child has his pains; he is not so free to do as he wishes. He is continually being told not to do this, not to do that, or being punished for what he has done wrong. His life is therefore not perfectly happy. When the young man starts to make his own living, he becomes free from the rules of school and parents; but at the time he is forced to accept duties. He can no longer expect others to pay for his food, his clothes and his room, but has to work for them if he wants to live comfortably. If he spends most of his time playing about in the way that he used to as a child, he will go hungry and suffer. And if he breaks the law of society as he used to break the laws of his parents, he may go to prison, lf, however, he works hard, keeps out of trouble, and has good health, he can have the great happiness of seeing himself make steady progress in his job and of building up his own position in society and enjoy success and good reputation.. Old age has always been thought of as the worst age to be, but it is not necessary for the old to be unhappy. Old age has its own happiness. They can have the joy of seeing their children making progress in life; they can watch their grandchildren growing up around them and, perhaps, best of all, they can, if their life has been a useful one, feel the happiness of having come through the battle of life safely and of having reached a time when they can lie back and rest, leaving others to continue the fight.

The idea of photographing Luka in motion was from .	"A lot of kids have dreams they'll never achieve due to the limitations of their little bodies. They want to fly, or to become a dinosaur, or to learn how to act like Spiderman. Luka Tavcar, 12, has muscular dystrophy and is totally dependent on his wheelchair. Nevertheless, late last year, he had an inspired plan: to be photographed walking around and having fun. He approached Matej Peljhan, an amateur photographer and a psychologist at CIRIUS rehabilitation center near Ljubljana, Slovenia, where Luka is a patient. At first, Peljhan was perplexed. How could he photograph a boy who can not move or act in motion? ""Luka wanted to see himself playing and having fun, but it seemed impossible,"" he says. Then Peljhan had a brainstorm: Luka could lie down on a piece of cloth and, with the help of an assistant, Peljhan would pose the boy as if he were jumping, climbing stairs, moving downhill on a skateboard, and playing basketball. Then Peljhan would shoot these images from above. The photos took about a month to produce; all were shot early this year. Peljhan, who lost his right arm and left eye as a child, says his own disabilities motivated him to make the photographs. ""I understand people with limitations,"" he says. He named the series ""The Little Prince"" after the French story by Antoine de Saint-Exupery in which a boy teaches a man about trust, hope, and friendship. Luka loves the photos. Matej himself understands what it is like to live with limitations--he lost his right arm and left eye as a child.""Luka wants to stay positive and his imagination helps him forget his physical limitation,"" says Peljhan. ""He's fragile, but he can see the world differently."""	['himself']

What is the author's attitude toward modern gold-planning?	"Many people have heard stories of the California gold rush during the 19thcentury, when lots of people went there in search for gold. Panning for gold has a rich and interesting history. Nowadays some people continue to pan for gold in California. Although it cannot be regarded as a method for earning income, taking on gold-panning as a hobby can give you a feeling of being in the old west and get you out into nature. The only tool that is required to pan for gold is a gold pan. You can use a regular old flat pan, but ""officially"" gold pans are quite cheap so you may as well buy one that is made for the task. Most sold pans come in either plastic or medal. Once you have your pan you will want to start practicing your gold panning technique. Panning for gold works because gold is much heavier than most rocks. To pan for gold you add rock and dirt form the bottom of a stream to your pan and then gently let water flow through the pan. The lighter-weight rocks are slowly swept away while any gold will be left behind in the pan. To start panning for gold, first you will need to find a good location. Try checking maps of your area and old history books to find location where there were gold mines in the past. Even though most of the gold have already been removed, there are likely to be small leftovers that you can find. Once you have found an area that looks promising, look for any small stream or river where you can try out panning for gold. Panning for gold requires patience and it may be a long time before you hit anything of value. However, it is an enjoyable hobby and provides a great opportunity to get outdoors, so don't give up too quickly."	['Positive.']
Why did the volunteers think he should work in the disaster area?	That day was a very good day. The volunteers who visited an orphanage now became the best friends each other. The four persons were Li Hui, the reporter of Jing Newspaper, Zhao Qiang and Huang Jian, reporters of Chongqing Television Station, and me. According to our experience of driving in the disaster area, it would be OK to drive in the morning, but the road was dangerous in the afternoon. So this morning we got off at 6:00 am. It is about 40 kilometers aim place. It would take not more than one hour normally. However, because of poor road conditions, we tried twice but failed to go through. We had to stop driving to wait for road repairing. It was very dangerous to park on the road in the mountain. To be honest, my experience in the disaster area were over load . I almost couldn't stand. But one thing had been supporting me, I had been very grateful to have such a chance to help the people of disaster area, to have such a chance to share my love. When we took two vehicles supplies to the orphanage, the leader of the orphanage Mr. Lang with 31 children was too excited to say anything. ,.	['Because they wanted to show their love there.']
Why do people think sleepwalking is nothing but a fantastic thing which doesn't have any explanation?	"There is an endless supply of stories about sleepwalkers . People have been said to climb on roofs, solve mathematical problems, write music, walk through windows, and do murder in their sleep. In Revere, Massachusetts, a hundred policemen searched for a lost boy who left his home in his sleep and woke up five hours later on a strange sofa in a strange living room, with no idea how he had got there. At the University of Lowa, a student was reported to have the habit of getting up in the middle of the night and walking three-quarters of a mile to the Lowa River. He would take a swim and then go back to his room to bed. An American expert on sleep claims that he has never seen a sleepwalker. He is said to know more about sleep than any other living man, and during the last thirty-five years he has lost a lot of sleep watching people sleep. He says, ""Of course, I know that there are sleepwalkers because I have read about them in the newspapers. But none of my sleepers ever walked, and if I were to advertise for sleepwalkers for an experiment, I doubt whether I would get many takers ."" Sleepwalking, however, is a scientific reality. It is one of those strange things that sometimes look quite fantastic . Doctors say that sleepwalking is much more common than is generally supposed. Many sleepwalkers do not try to find help and their sleepwalking is never recorded."	['Most sleepwalkers do not seek help for their problem.']
The redwood trees were cut down mainly _ .	"At the age of 16, Julia Butterfly Hill quit school and worked at a restaurant. For many years, she was only interested in making money and material things. Then one day she had a serious car accident, which changed her life. Hill said: ""I realized I wanted to find a more powerful purpose for being here on this planet."" As soon as she recovered, Hill traveled to California. There she saw ancient redwood trees, which are the largest trees in the whole world. The wood from redwood trunks is very hard. So the Pacific Lumber Company cut down many of the huge redwoods to use for construction. There are not many forests of these trees left. Many environmental activists want to protect the remaining trees. The redwoods are very important to the environment. In 1997 Hill learned a group called Earth First was working to protect a particular group of trees. They decided to send someone up into a redwood tree, hoping this would stop the company from cutting the trees down. Julia Butterfly Hill volunteered. Hill lived in the tree for over two years without ever coming down. Her home was a 6-by-8-foot tree house, 180 feet up. It is always cold and wet in a redwood tree. There were even very serious winter storms while Hill was in the tree. The wind and cold almost knocked Hill out of the tree. But she did not fall -- she survived. Finally, after years of arguing, the company decided to protect Luna, the tree Hill lived in. They signed an agreement to never cut down this huge redwood tree or the trees around it. When Hill put her feet on the earth again, she began to cry. But from that moment on Hill hasn't stopped working to protect the environment."	['because they had great economic value']
The research mentioned in the passage is mainly about _ .	"Monkeys prefer heavy metal to classical music, according to researchers at the University of Wisconsin whose findings are published this week in Biology Letters. Scientists played a selection of music to a group of South American cotton-top monkeys but the only sound that got a reaction were from the heavy metal band Metallica. They were seemingly disinterested in Led Zeppelin, Miles Davis and Bach, but after the beautiful sound of Master of Puppets by Metallica was played the monkeys calmed down. ""Monkeys interpret rising and falling sounds differently than humans. Oddly, their only response to several samples of human music was a calming response to the heavy-metal band Metallica,"" said Professor Charles Snowdon, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Rather than making them excited or aggressive, the heavy metal tracks had a comforting effect. Dr Snowdon, who teamed up with National Symphony Orchestra musican David Teie, also played the monkeys music composed specifically for them. Although they enjoyed Metallica, they were much more interested in these pieces. A melody based on the short calls of scared monkeys led to anxiety levels rapidly growing, researchers found, while one based on long calls the creatures make when they are happy had a calming effect. Frans B.M. de Waal, a professor of psychology at Emory University who studies animals, said the findings appear to say more about how monkeys respond to the sounds they make than they do about music or the evolution of music. Dr Snowdon no longer has a monkey colony to use in his research, but he said his co-author David Teie is exploring the concept of music for cats. ""If we understand how we can affect their emotional states through using musical sound and aspects of our speech, maybe those of us living with companion animals can have a better relationship with them, too,"" Snowdon said."

After the author's graduation, _ .	For most people, graduation is an exciting day - the culmination of years of hard work. My graduation day... was not. I remember that weekend two years ago, Family and friends had traveled far to watch our class walk across the stage. But like everyone else in my graduating class, I had watched the economy go from bad to worse during my senior year. We graduates had degrees, but very limited prospects . I hadn't secured a job, and I knew that the next day, when my lease ended, I would no longer have a place to call home. The weeks ahead weren't easy. I gathered up everything I couldn't carry and put it into storage. Then, because I had no opportunities in my small university town, I packed up my car and drove to California to find work. But what I thought would take a week dragged into two, then four, and 100 job applications later, I found myself still jobless. The due date to begin paying back my student loans was creeping even closer. Have you ever felt utter dread? That feeling became a constant in my life. The most frustrating part was no matter how much I tried, I just couldn't seem to make any progress. So what did I do to maintain my sanity? I wrote. Something about putting my words on a page made everything clearer. Something about writing gave me hope. I channeled my frustration into a children's book. Beyond the river was the story of an unlikely hero, a little fish who refused to give up. And then one day, with no writing degree or contacts in the writing world - just hard work and perseverance - I was offered a publishing contract for my first book. After that, things were in place, I was offered a second book deal. Then, a few months later, I got an interview with the Walt Disney Company and was hired shortly after. The moral of this story is... don't give up, even if things look bleak now. Two years ago I was drinking cold soup right out the can. Things change. All we need is the courage to push beyond the river.	['things turned even worse than he had expected']
What will the next part of the text possibly talk about?	"Caffeine not only gives us a daily jump start, but new research suggests it also can strengthen long-term memory. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, nearly 90 percent of people worldwide consume about 200 milligrams of caffeine each day. That' s equivalent to about one strong cup of coffee a day. Writing in "" Nature Neuroscience"" , Johns Hopkins University researchers say their findings show that caffeine strengthens certain memories for up t0 24 hours after being taken in. "" We've always known that caffeine has cognitive-enhancing effects , but its ,particular effects on strengthening memories and making them resistant to forgetting has never been examined in detail in humans, "" said senior author of the paper Michael Yassa. "" We re- port for the first time a specific effect of caffeine on reducing forgetting over 24 hours. "" Conducting a double-blind trial, the researchers worked with a test group of people who didn't regularly consume caffeinated products. Five minutes after studying a series of images, the test subjects were given either a placebo or a 200-milligram caffeine tablet. To check the caffeine levels of their test subjects, the research team took saliva samples from them before they took their tablets and again one, three and 24 hours after- wards. Both groups of test participants ( those who took the placebo and those who took the caffeine tablet) were tested the following day to see if they could recognize the images they' d seen the previous day. The test included showing the test subjects another series of images that included some new images , those that were shown the previous day, as well as other images that were similar, but not the same as those they had viewed earlier. The researchers found that more members of the group who were given the caffeine tablets were able to correctly identify some of the new images as "" similar"" to previously viewed images rather than incorrectly identifying them as the same. ""We also know that caffeine is associated with health and longevity and may havesome protective effects from cognitive decline like Alzheimer' s disease . "" said Yassa."

From the text we learn that _ .	"In Colombia , there are some unwritten rules that people are used to , These rules are not officially established , but people do respect them . For example , on a bus , a person keeps a distance from another person , and people don't like to touch each other . Many people come to work late because they prefer to wait for another bus if the first one is too crowded . They don't want to have to stand too close to another person , or maybe they are afraid of starting a conversation . A friend of mine in Colombia once said his mom got angry because he came home late , so he asked her , "" Mom , what do you think of most people arriving at their jobs so late ? "" That gave her the answer to her question since everyone knows no one wants to get on a bus that is too crowded . His mother realized at that moment that customs have a big influence on a person's life . Sometimes , people don't like to make any kind of conversation or make eye contact with others . For example , when they are in line at a bank , they prefer to look up or down rather than look at other people . Moreover , people usually look down when they are in an elevator . Not only on a bus , in line at a bank , and in an elevator do people usually avoid talking to other people , but also in the streets when they are walking , they prefer to look down and to avoid contact with others ."

How did the father get to work usually?	"When I was growing up,I was embarrassed to be seen with my father. He was badly crippled ,and when we would walk together,his hand on my arm for balance,people would stare,I would be ashamed of the unwanted attention. It was difficult to walk together--and because of that,we didn't say much as we went along. But as we started out,he always said,""You set the pace. I will try to follow you."" Our usual walk was to or from the subway,which was how he got to work. He went to work sick,and even in bad weather. He almost never missed a day,and would make it to the office even if others could not. It was a matter of pride for him. When snow or ice was on the ground,it was impossible for him to walk,even with help. At such times my sister or I would pull him through the streets of Brooklyn,N.Y.,on a child's sleigh to the subway entrance. Once there,he would try to grasp handrail until he reached the lower steps that the warmer tunnel air kept ice free. In Manhattan the subway station was the basement of his office building,and he would not have to go outside again until we met him in Brooklyn on his way home. When I think of it now,I am surprised at how much courage it must have taken for a grown man to suffer from shame and disability. And I am also surprised at how he did it--without bitterness or complaint. He never talked about himself as an object of pity,nor did he show any envy of the more fortunate or able. What he looked for in others was a ""good heart"",and if he found one,the owner was good enough for him. Now that I am older,I believe that is a proper standard by which to judge people,even though I still don't know exactly what a ""good heart"" is. But I know the times I don't have one myself. He has been away for many years now,but I think of him often. I wonder if he sensed my reluctance to be seen with him during our walks. If he did,I am sorry I never told him how sorry I was,how unworthy I was,how I regretted it. I think of him when I complain about my troubles,when I am envious of another's good fortune,when I don't have a ""good heart""."	['By subway.']

What was the top issue of Worldwide Cyber Security Summit?	"China supports international efforts to secure cyberspace but believes each nation's ""Internet sovereignty "" must be respected, a top Chinese official said at a cyber security conference on Tuesday. ""China, like many other countries, is very concerned about cyber security,"" said Liu Zhengrong, deputy director general of the Internet Affairs Bureau of the State Council Information Office. ""China faces severe cyber security threats,"" Liu told participants here at the Worldwide Cyber Security Summit, a gathering of government and business leaders from 40 countries hosted by the EastWest Institute think tank. ""International cooperation is much needed to safeguard international cyberspace,"" Liu said. But ""Internet sovereignty of each country needs to be respected,"" the Chinese official added. ""Different national and cultural conditions"" should be taken into account. Liu declined to answer repeated questions about cyber attacks last year on Google which the Internet giant said originated in China and led to the California company's decision to reroute its searches through Hong Kong. ""The Chinese government firmly opposes cyber attacks in any form and Chinese law clearly states that any hackers will be held responsible for their actions,"" he said. Liu said China itself is a ""a major victim of cyber attacks and network viruses"" and has laws in place to deal with hackers. ""Internet-related crimes (in China) are showing a steady upward trend,"" Liu said. ""We suffer big economic losses from hacking networks and viruses - around $1 billion dollars (6.8 billion yuan) a year."" In 2009, Chinese law enforcement authorities investigated about 48,000 cases, a 37 percent increase over 2008, he said. While China has a dynamic Internet population of more than 400 million users and millions of bloggers, there is no ""absolute freedom"" on the Web, Liu said. ""I don't think there is absolute freedom in this world,"" he said. ""When you are speaking via the Internet you must obey laws and respect others' lawful rights."" Last Thursday, Wang Chen, minister of the State Council Information Office, said China has been actively promoting a real-name registration system for Internet and cell phone users to better manage Internet information and services. China needs laws that will step up monitoring for ""harmful information"" and block ""overseas hostile forces from infiltrating through the Internet,"" Wang said. Last week, China tightened its State Secrets law, holding Internet and mobile phone operators responsible for customers who try to leak State secrets.

We can know from the passage that .	"Like most parents, I worry that my child isn't getting enough sleep. Now it turns out that doctors have been warning kids don't get enough sleep for over a century--long before iPads, and texting robbed children of peaceful sleep. What's more, there's no solid scientific basis for pediatricians' recommendations on the amount of time children need to sleep. That's the word from researchers in Australia. It turns out that children are sleeping less than those in days of old. The researchers, at the University of South Australia's Health and Use of Time Group, found that kids' nightly sleep time declined by about three-quarters of a minute each year for the period they studied. My daughter was more likely to beg for a few more minutes of Angry Birds before bedtime.That means nowadays my daughter is sleeping about 50 minutes a night less than her grandfather who had to get up to milk the cows at 5:30 am. What hasn't changed is the predictions from health professionals on the consequences of lack of sleep. ""This is a sleepless age and more and more... we are turning night into day,"" one expert said in 1905. Back then, sleep was seen as a way to restore ""wearied brain tissue"". Children and ""clever"" children were thought to be most at risk, and most in need of energy-restoring sleep. The words may be different today, but the threats are pretty much the same. Parents are told that children risk mental and physical problems, and even obesity, if they don't get enough sleep. So the Australians looked to see how much sleep kids do need. The answer is the biggest surprise of this study--no one really knows. ""There is almost no exact evidence for proper sleep for children,"" the authors write. Their work was published in the journal Pediatrics."	['nobody exactly knows how much kids should sleep']

How old was Yao Beina when she started to sing for people?	"Not only a popular singer was Yao Beina, but also she was an energetic and warm-hearted angel. She had her corneas donated to two men who needed them, which helped them see the world clearly again. Yao was born in a music family on Sept. 26, 1981 in Wuhan. She started to learn the piano at the age of 4, and she sang her first song on the stage when she was 9 years old. Yao did quite well in singing, so she took part in the thirteenth Youth Singing Competition and won the first prize. She became well-known to the public after making a series of songs for the hit TV drama ""The Legend of Zhenhuan"" in 2012, and the mandarin version of ""Let It Go"" from Disney's ""Frozen"". In July 2013, she competed in The Voice of China II and finally got the second place in Na Ying's team. She had won a lot of music awards before she was famous. Yao Beina was unfortunate to be diagnosed with breast cancer and had a successful operation in 2011. Since then, she has fought against the disease for about four years while keeping singing, but sadly she failed. She originally thought of donating all of her organs to save others' lives, but failed to do it because of her serious illness. She's gone, even though she had never stopped struggling with cancer. Heaven just got another beautiful angel, with her beautiful voice and kindness."	['Nine.']
According to the passage, the following statements are True except _ .	"The average British 22 year-old has more than 1,000 online friends on sites like Facebook, compared to those in their fifties who have fewer than 20, according to a new study. The ""Facebookgeneration gap"" has been highlighted in a new piece of research which shows that the average 22 year-old claims to have 1,000 or more friends on sites like Facebook. People in their twenties have more than 50 times as many digital friends as those who are over 50 years old, despite the popularity of sites like Facebook with the older generations, says a study conducted by consumer research group Intersperience. The news comes during the same week Facebook's second-in command, Sheryl Sandberg, is visiting the UK to deliver a speech at the London School of Economics. Facebook's chief operating officer is going to speak about how the social web has transformed people's friendships and relationships. The survey found that there was a clear link between people's age and the number of online friends they have.The researchers found that those aged 13 to 16, have an average of 450 friends on social networks, with girls having slightly more friends that boys.People in their thirties tend to have between 100 and 200 friends, while those in their forties have between 50 and 100. However, those using sites such as Facebook over the age of 50, tended to have 20 or less friends.The oldest person surveyed was 70 years old. Paul Hudson, Intersperience's chief executive, said: ""Our research underlines fundamental changes taking place in British society as a result of finally entering the digital age.Half of the UK population are on Facebook now.In a social media context, a 'friend' means something different to a 20 year old than to a 50 year old."" He added: ""Social networking activity is just one example of how different groups are adapting to the digital age at different paces.In this case, age is the determining factor - however in other instances it is not."""

What is the best title of the passage?	During the week days, they are luckily busy office people; but on weekends, they are just a brood of stay-home animals. A recent survey shows that office workers in China prefer quiet and easy ways to spend their weekends. In the survey, conducted by job seeking and offering website Zhaopin.com, 32.8 percent of the 6,000 respondents choose to stay home at weekends and have a good rest, the Beijing Morning Post reported. Twenty percent use their days-off to do housework. And only 19.3 percent are willing to have fun during the break time from work. Their first choice of fun is shopping. Other choices, though practiced by few, include meeting friends, accompanying the children, trips to the suburbs, and lessons for more skills. When they. go shopping, 54.5 percent of the white-collars actually shop in supermarkets, while 27.9. percent attend other stores, especially when discounts are offered. These activities don't seem to cost much, as 60 percent spend average less than 200 yuan (US$26) during weekends, and 30 percent no more than 500 yuan. When asked whom they would spend the weekends with, about 40 percent mention their partners, and 30 percent prefer a weekend all by themselves. Less than 20 percent hang out with friends. Only 5.8 percent would kill the time with their colleagues. This is because we tend to avoid too many personal contacts with our co-workers when we don't have to work with them, according to some experts.	['Office people prefer easy weekends']
According to the author, what causes our current and future global problems?	It is true that world population is growing, but this is not the cause of our current and future global problems. Believing this will cause us to ignore the real problem and risk long-term damage to our planet. Let me start by explaining why overpopulation is a _ . For one thing, the UN Population Division regularly predicts population growth but provides a low variant , medium variant, and high variant to factor in various possibilities. In the 2010 revision, their high variant suggests that the world population will be almost 16 billion in 2100, but the low variant predicts it will peak at 8 billion and decrease to just over 6 billion by 2100. In most cases, it is the low variant that has come true in the past, suggesting the same will be true of their future population predictions. In addition to this, the size of families is actually decreasing. For another, if the Earth is overpopulated, there needs to be insufficient food, water, and space for humans to live. However, Indian economist Raj Krishna estimates that India alone is able to increase crop produce to the point of providing the entire world's food supply. The World Food Programme confirms that there is sufficient food grown to feed the world and there is the same amount of fresh water on the planet now as there was 10,000 years ago. So how is it possible that the number of people in the world is affecting our planet? Therefore, it is not an increase in population but an increase in consumption that is a severe threat. Materialism and overconsumption are facts of life for everybody in the western world, as possessions reflect a person's status in society and people strive to obtain happiness through owning the latest fashionable goods. Not only that, but waste is a common occurrence which has a huge effect on our resources. It is a sad truth that 80% of the world's resources are currently used by just 20% of the world's population. Our overconsumption must be addressed now to make our lives more sustainable and avoid continuing the terrible damage to the environment we are causing. The key is education. If we do not work towards this but instead focus on the wrong issue, we may find ourselves living on a planet that can no longer sustain human life.	['The fast growth of material needs.']

From the passage we can learn that _ .	"Machu Picchu is considered to be a truly extraordinary archaeological discovery and is one of South America's largest tourist sites. As many as one thousand visitors visit the ancient Incan ruins daily. What draws vacationers and adventurers to this remote location high in the Andes Mountains of Peru ? A large part of the attraction is the mysteries that surround Machu Picchu. For example, Machu Picchu is considered ""the lost city"" of the Incas because it was never found by Spanish invaders and was known to only a few local peasants for almost four hundred years. The ""city in the clouds"", Machu Picchu's lasting beauty comes from the careful blending of its striking architecture with its mountaintop environment. Its greatest skill shows are in the stone structures, which equals that of the ancient Egyptians. The stone blocks were so appropriately cut that they fit together without the need for mud. The largest stones at Machu Picchu weigh as much as fifteen tons! It has been difficult to explain how the huge blocks were transported. The buildings, including many that have survived lots of earthquakes, contain stones which _ so perfectly that a knife cannot be forced between them. When compared to other ancient civilizations, it is difficult to understand how Machu Picchu could have been missed by the Spanish and lost from history for four hundred years. For many of the mysteries of Machu Picchu being unsolved, it is clear why Machu Picchu remains ""the most famous ruins in all of South America""."

What does the passage mainly talk about?	"According to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global temperatures have risen by approximately 0.6degC in the past century, caused mainly by emissions of greenhouse gases produced by human activities,such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.Temperatures are to increase between 1.6degC and 5.8degC in the next century, accompanied by sea level rise and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. The best available evidence suggests that climate changes since the 1970s may already be causing over 150,000 deaths annually, and that greenhouse gas emissions would increase disease burdens in the coming decades.The risks are concentrated in the poorest population, who have contributed least to the problem. The Kyoto Protocol is signed by 128 nations,and commits the participating industrialized countries to cutting emissions of greenhouse gases by over 5% below 1990 level by the period of 20082012. ""Over 600 thousand people died in weatherrelated disasters in the 1990s.Temperature and rainfall influence the rates of diseases and infections including malaria,and malnutrition,which together cause over 3.5 million deaths a year.The Kyoto Protocol is the first step towards protecting the climate system,which exerts such a strong influence on our health"",said Dr Kerstin Leitner,Assistant DirectorGeneral for Sustainable Development and Healthy Environments. While acting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is also essential to protect vulnerable communities from the effects of climate changes.WHO works to promote measures such as protection from malaria and other climate sensitive diseases, and reliable access to clean water and sanitation, for people in the most vulnerable developing countries.Increasing disease control efforts will also help to protect current and future generations from the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions."

It's no wonder that Britons hold the reputation of having a ""stiff upper lip"" - being cold and not showing any emotion. Britain's reputation as a grumpy country may, however, simply be the result of a cultural misunderstanding. According to the BBC, British actor Michael Caine once said: ""I think what is British about me is my feelings and awareness of others and their situations. English people are always known to be well-mannered and cold, but we are not cold - we don't _ your situation. If we are heartbroken, we don't scream in your face with tears - we go home and cry on our own. It's completely to do with your comfort - we don't intrude on your space. That's very English."" A BBC reader noted that the perceived coldness of British people is actually their way of dealing with hardship. Remembering the terrorist attacks in London on July 7, 2005, Stuart Colley, who lived in the capital at the time, said: ""It seemed to me that most people's response was a 'cruel' determination to carry on and not to 'fall' into an over-emotional outpouring of grief or anger - despite what many of us felt inside. Our stiff upper lip seems to be something that gives us strength as a society when we most need it."""	['show how not giving in to emotions can help one to get through a tough time']
Why is it difficult for WWF to do all the things they want to?	Over 30% of the natural world has been seriously destroyed by humans over the last 30 years. This is because the number of people living on Earth is nearly six billion . All of these people need food, space and energy. As a result, lots of Earth's natural resources will be used up. When we destroy our earth to get natural resources such as wood or oil, animals often lose their living space. They cannot have enough food, and they will get hurt or die. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international charity. It tries to prevent humans from destroying more of nature than is necessary. For example, in China WWF is working with the local government to reconnect some small lakes in Anhui Province to the Yangtze River and to create more protected areas so that China's natural beauty will not be lost in the future. WWF works in more than 50 countries, saving rainforests and stopping hunters from killing rare animals and protecting traditional ways of life in areas where they are in danger of being lost. WWF's main goal is to encourage development that does not harm the environment and the animals that live in it. Even though the charity is known all over the world, and a lot of people support the goals of WWF, not so many donate money often. This makes it difficult for the charity to do all the things it wants to do.	"[""Because WWF doesn't have enough money from donations""]"

According to the story, we can know that the Harry Potter books _ .	"While I was in my 4th month of pregnancy with my second child, we were preparing for a trip to Louisiana, where Marshall's family live, to celebrate Jane's 2nd birthday. Two days before we were to leave, we got the shocking news that I was going to lose the baby. Not knowing when this would happen, we decided to continue with our trip. Since Marshall's family lives on a 600-acre cattle farm, you often find that you have a lot of time to yourself to think when you are there. That is precisely what I did not want to do at this time. I told Marshall that I needed to get a good book to get lost in while I was there. I told him I heard the Harry Potter books were good, so he went out and got the first one for me. During that trip, I totally got lost in the book, which was of great help during a time when I needed a distraction to forget about the sadness. In the book, I noticed the name ""Seamus"". I vaguely remembered it was pronounced ""Shamus"" and I liked the sound of that. I mentioned it to Marshall and he liked it too. Toward the end of the trip, I had just 5 chapters left and I knew I was about to finish the first book, which I was pretty excited about. Soon after we put Jane down to bed, I had started labor , so I was unable to read. The labor lasted 5 and 1/2 hours, but Marshall stayed there with me, sitting beside me and reading aloud the last 5 chapters of Harry Potter. I can never fully explain how much that helped me through the experience. And ever since then, Marshall and I both have been fans of the Harry Potter books. We remember how they helped us get through that time of our lives. We were sad to have lost the baby, but the name Seamus started our journey toward adoption. And we gave this name to our adopted son. Though our Seamus doesn't have a drop of Irish blood in him, the name fits him perfectly."	['have someone called Seamus in them']
The text mainly discusses whether high schools should _ .	In some countries,open campus is widely accepted. For example, French students have a two-hour lunch break from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. During their lunch break, they can eat at home or at a restaurant. But students in the Philippines have a tougher schedule. They have only two 15-minute breaks and an hour for lunch. What Schedule would be best for American schools? Having breaks between classes is great, but having breaks off campus is even better. There are several advantages to open campus, including simple conveniences such as being able to eat different meals during lunchtime, rather than having the cafeteria dishes, as well as having the chance to take a break at home. However, there are more reasons I disagree with allowing high school students the right to have an open campus. Sure, it's great being able to escape school during the day for a while, but soon enough that may easily become the rest of the day. If open campus is allowed, it is very possible that such freedom will make it all too easy for students to skip their afternoon classes. Of course, there will be students responsible enough to come back to school. But unexpected problems such as heavy traffic, city bus delays or cars breaking down may prevent them from returning to school. It benefits the students to stay in school during lunch hours to avoid transportation issues. Depending on how close the school is to restaurants and students' homes, open campus could be a great idea. Unfortunately, though, most public schools in America are not located close enough to restaurants or students' homes, thus causing the negative results to outweigh the positives in the end.

What happened to the author's daughter according to the beginning of the passage?	"""But what if I break my arm again?"" my 5-year-old daughter asked. I knew how much she wanted to learn to ride. Yet ever since she'd fallen off her bike and broken her arm, she'd been afraid. ""Oh honey,"" I said. ""I don't think you'll break another arm."" ""But I could, couldn't I?"" ""Yes,"" I admitted, and found myself struggling for the right thing to say. ""I don't think I want to ride,"" she said and got off her bike. We walked away and sat down beside a tree. ""Don't you want to ride with your friends?"" I asked. ""And I thought you were hoping to start riding your bike to school next year,"" I added. ""I was,"" she said in a low voice. ""You know, honey,"" I said. ""Most everything you do comes with dangers. You could break your arm at gymnastics. Do you want to stop going to the gym?"" ""No, of course not!"" she replied. And with a determined spirit, she stood up and agreed to try again. I held on to the back of her bike until she found the courage to say, ""Let's go!"" I spent the rest of the afternoon at the park watching a very brave little girl overcome a fear, and congratulating myself for being an independent single parent. As we walked home, pushing the bike as we made our way along the sidewalk, she asked me about a conversation she'd overheard me having with my mother the night before. ""Why were you and Grandma arguing last night?"" ""It's nothing."" I told her. She shrugged . ""Grandma said she just wanted you to find someone to love."" ""What Grandma wants is for some guy to break my heart again,"" I snapped. ""But Mom ..."" ""You're too young to understand."" I told her. She was quiet for the next few minutes. Then she looked up and in a small voice said, ""So I guess love isn't like a broken arm."" Unable to answer, we walked the rest of the way in silence. When I got home, I let go and agreed to meet a man called Steve. Steve was the man for me. We married less than a year later. It turned out my mother and my daughter were right."	['She fell off her bike and broke her arm.']
According to the writer, _ could be the best way to prevent ourselves from being left out.	In our life, we have rarely expressed our gratitude to the one who'd lived those years with us.In fact, we don't have to wait for anniversaries to thank the ones close to us--the ones so easily overlooked. If I have learned anything about giving thanks, it is this: give it now!While your feeling of appreciation is alive and sincere, act on it. Saying thanks is such an easy way to add to the world's happiness. Saying thanks not only brightens someone else's world, but it also brightens yours. If you're feeling left out, unloved or unappreciated, try reaching out to others. It may be just the medicine you need. Of course, there are times when you can't express gratitude immediately. In that case don't let embarrassment sink you into silence--speak up the first time you have the chance. Once a young minister, Mark Brian, was sent to a remote parish of Kwakiutl Indians in British Columbia. He had been told that the Indians did not have a word for thank you. But Brian soon found that these people had exceptional generosity. Instead of saying thanks, it is their custom to return every favor with a favor of their own, and every kindness with an equal or superior kindness. They do their thanks. I wonder if we had no words in our vocabulary for thank you, would we do a better job of communicating our gratitude? Would we be more responsive, more sensitive and more caring? Thankfulness sets in motion a chain of reaction that transforms people all around us--including ourselves, for no one ever misunderstands the melody of a grateful heart.

What makes Oscar the cat so special?	"Oscar the cat seems to have an unnatural ability for predicting when nursing home patients are going to die, by curling up next to them during their final hours. His accuracy, observed in 25 cases, has led the staff to call family members once he has chosen someone. It usually means the patient has less than four hours to live. ""Many family members take some comfort from it. They appreciate the companionship that the cat provides for their dying loved one,"" said Dosa, a doctor and assistant professor of medicine at Brown University. The 2-year-old cat was adopted as a kitten and grew up in a third-floor dementia unit at the Steere House Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, where the facility treats people with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease and other illnesses. After about six months, the staff noticed Oscar would make his own rounds, just like the doctors and nurses. He'd smell and observe patients, then sit beside people who would end up dying in a few hours. Dosa said Oscar seems to take his work seriously. ""Oscar is better at predicting death than the people who work here,"" said Dr. Joan Teno of Brown University, who treats patients at the nursing home and is an expert on care for the terminally ill. She was convinced of Oscar's talent when he made his 13th correct call. While observing one patient, Teno said she noticed the woman wasn't eating, was breathing with difficulty and that her legs had a bluish color1, signs that often mean death is near. Oscar wouldn't stay inside the room, though, so Teno thought _ . Instead, it turned out the doctor's prediction was roughly 10 hours too early. Sure enough, during the patient's final two hours, nurses told Teno that Oscar joined the woman at her bedside. Doctors say most of the people who get a visit from the sweet-faced, gray-and-white cat are so ill that they probably don't know he's there, so patients aren't aware he's a predictor of death. Most families are grateful for the advance warning. No one's certain if Oscar's behavior is scientifically significant or points to a cause. Teno wonders if the cat senses mysterious scents or reads something from the behavior of the nurses who raised him."	['He senses when patients are to die.']
What is the main purpose of the author writing the passage?	People think what I do is so wonderful because I interview stars.And I have to admit that when I first started working at Sassy in 1987 I was excited about that part of my job for the first couple of months,anyway.Then I noticed how stars would fool me around for months.I could never get enough time with a star to find out anything interesting,and some acted just simply rudely.I started hating the way I was treated,and I was really disappointed to see that these people I had worshipped before were pretty ordinary.So I decided I would just tell the truth instead of keeping up their myths .If the star was a bad guy,I would say so.If I thought anyone was stupid,I did not hold back that information. I thought readers would appreciate that kind of honesty.Surprisingly,many of them hated me for it.I have gotten so many attacks on my character.In their eyes,being famous is everything,even more desirable that being truly creative and talented. Why do we need stars?In fact,the media created stars to satisfy our basic need for gossip .Over time,talking about people we have never met and we are never likely to meet has become what we are crazy about.Thus,some people are more interested in the personal lives of the stars than in the lives of their own family and their own friends.That is why it is so ridiculous when a star wants to discuss only his or her work in an interview--as we care.We want the dirt on their personal lives. There is another reason we worship stars.As a whole,our society is not as religious as it once was.It seems that people need something to fulfill them the way religion once did.Star worship exists as an unfulfilling desire for true heroes. We make them stars,but then their reputation makes us feel unimportant,and we truly feel better about ourselves when they die.I am part of this whole process.No wonder I feel soiled at the end of workday.

From the survey we know that among the people surveyed_.	"Nowadays,people in China are increasingly interested in celebrating foreign festivals,especially those western festivals. A survey conducted recently by sina.com showed that among the 18,222 people surveyed 63.90%said celebrating Christmas is just another way of recreation,nothing serious while 17.85%surveyed considered the festival as a fashion act.showing they were not ""out"".These two parts clearly indicate the general opinion of the young.10.45%people involved said the celebration of a religious western festival with so much enthusiasm is ly ridiculous pursuit of foreign goodness.Only 7.80%of people define Christmas as a kind of festival colonization The arising of celebrating foreign festivals clearly has something to do, with the advancement of China's economy.In my point of view.Christmas and other festivals celebrated in China have difference from the origin.They have lost their religious background and turned into a big occasion to have fun and enjoy life.Shop owners' pockets are filled,the public's hunger for happiness is filled,and that is enough.Foreign festivals in China are more like carnivals giving people pleasure and enjoyment. The crisis of traditional Chinese festivals that are losing their attraction may be linked to the culture tradition and background of the festivals.Most Chinese festival culture is related more or less to real life ""The country is based on its people while the people are relied on their food"". But the western culture shows much of romance.Some festivals have their religious background while others have much to do with culture and people.At this point,food seems to be too plain.Flowers and chocolates are more welcomed. Foreign festivals in China today are celebrated for fun.They give people opportunities to relax mad celebrate,to show appreciation and gratefulness.The acceptance of foreign festivals generally depends on the openness of the public,the familiarity with the western culture,and most importantly,on people's economic status."

Which of the following ways can not be used as a form of communication?	For as long as humans have lived on the earth, they have made use of various forms of communication. Generally, this expression of thoughts and feelings has been in the form of oral speech. When there is a spoken language problem, communication can be carried out through sign language, in which gestures stand for letters, words, and ideas. Tourists and people unable to hear or speak have often had to turn to this form of expression. When gestures describe words or ideas, they can often be used internationally. When used for spelling words however, where each gesture stands for a single letter, people must share the same written language. Body language sends ideas or thoughts by certain actions, either meaningfully or not. A wink can be a way of showing that the person is only joking. A nod means agreement, while shaking the head indicates disagreement. Other forms of language can be found in Braille (a reading system of raised dots read with the fingertips used by the blind), signal flags, Morse code, and smoke signals. Road maps and picture signs also guide and warn people. While language is the most common form of communication, other systems and techniques also express human thoughts and feelings.	['thought']

Self-tracking was firstly come up with by _ .	"What Is Self-tracking All about Perhaps you've tracked how many kilometers you've run, how many hours you've slept or how much you've eaten in a day. If so, you've taken part in a popular movement called the ""Quantified Self Movement"" or ""Self-tracking"". Maybe you've wanted to change a bad habit but couldn't. Self-tracking may be your answer. The idea is to collect information about your everyday activities and analyze them to help improve and form a healthier lifestyle. Recently, tools such as smartphones, apps, along with newly published wearable things, are making self-tracking easy. Today, one can use Fitbit, the Jawbone Up, Google Glass or a smart watch to record personal data including sleeping hours, stress levels, heart rate and mood. So why does a person self-track? Someone may be trying to lose weight or improve their sleep. Another person feels tired after eating. Self-tracking could help him to know what foods make him sleepy and watch his diet. [:Z#xx#k.Com] Tracking daily activities isn't a new concept. In years past, athletes and their coaches kept notes food, training and sleep in order to achieve an athletic goal. Similarly, doctors have also helped patients to record parts of their lifestyles and eating habits to help fight health problems. However, it wasn't until 2007 that magazine writers Gary Wolf and Kim Kelly created the term ""Quantified Self"" or ""self-tracking"". Although self-tracking has many advantages, Dennis Nash, president of Data Speaks Health Solutions, says self-tracking has its disadvantages. Once people start tracking their daily activities, it can become an extra task people like to do often. Also, they might begin to worry too much about their health. Though self-tracking doesn't make sure that one's quality of life will improve, it can encourage people to make healthier choices."	['two magazine writers']

What did Ann's baby carrier look like?	"A baby carrier is like a backpack for carrying a baby. Ann Moore introduced the idea of a baby carrier to American people nearly 50 years ago. Ann spent two years in Africa in the early 1960s. She worked as a nurse there. Ann saw babies wrapped in bright cloth tied to their mothers' backs. The babies snuggled close to their mothers, and the mothers could use their hands to do other things. In 1964, Ann had her own baby. She tried making a carrier like the one African mothers used. The carrier was like a backpack. Everywhere Ann went with her baby in the carrier, people asked, ""Where can I buy one?"" In 1965, Ann and her mother began to sell handmade carriers. Ann received a patent for the baby carrier in 1969. By that time, the baby carrier had leg holes and straps that could be made longer or shorter. It could also be worn on the back or front. By 1979, the baby carriers were made in a factory. These baby carriers cost less to make and more than 25,000 were sold every month. When Ann made her first baby carrier, she just wanted to keep her baby close and still have her hands free to do other things. Now all over the world babies ride in baby carriers, close to their parents, safe and happy. ,."	['It was like a backpack with leg holes and adjustable   straps.']

Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"""It was all his own idea, "" says Pat Peters, the 38-year-old wife of Palo Alto, California high school . Bob had just drawn up a ""motherhood contract"" ----- a document stating that for 70 days this summer he would take over the care and feeding of the couple's four children, plus all household chores . Although he didn't even know how to make coffee when he signed, he was quite confident.(He thought the experience would make a nice book.) After 40 of the 70 days, he was ready to give up. ""I was beaten down, completely humbled, "" admits Peters. Three weeks later he spoke to the local press (also part of the bargain), stating, ""Not only is motherhood a difficult task, not only is it never-ending, it is an impossible job for any normal human being."" Bob and Pat were high school sweethearts. After they were married in 1960, she worked as a secretary to help put him through university. Since then Bob has been the football and wrestling coach at Palo Alto's Cubberley High while Pat raised the kids. Then two years ago Pat went back to work as a secretary at Cubberley. ""I had been around children so much,"" she sighs , ""I couldn't talk to a grown-up."" She continued to run the household, however----- until Bob signed the contract, whereupon she decided to relax and enjoy it. Although Peters had consulted with his school's home economics teachers and the head of the cafeteria , his meals were sometimes a disaster. ""I tried to slip the butter I'd forgotten under the eggs after they were frying, "" he says. For the last three weeks, the family ate out a lot--sometimes having Macdonald's hamburgers for lunch and dinner. As for housekeeping, a home economics teacher had told Bob that a room always looks clean if the bed is made. ""I found an easier way-----I shut the doors, "" he says. Soon the kids were wearing the same clothes for a week. ""I made them wear their shirts inside out, and when we went to pick up Pat at work they turned them right side out so they would look clean."" Now that Bob has publicly admitted he was wrong, he is routinely sharing the child-raising and household tasks with Pat. The tentative title of his book about the summer is taken from something he shouted at the kids one day."	['Bob tried to cook good meals for his children.']

The research at Duke University indicated that _	In the 19th century, there used to be a model of how to be a good person. There are all these torrents of passion flowing through you. Your job, as captain of your soul, is to erect dams to keep these passions in check. Your job is to just say no to laziness, lust, greed, drug use and the other sins. These days that model is out of fashion. You usually can't change your behavior by simply resolving to do something. Knowing what to do is not the same as being able to do it. Your willpower is not like a dam that can block the torrent of self-indulgence. It's more like a muscle, which tires easily. Moreover, you're a social being. If everybody around you is overeating, you'll probably do so, too. The 19th-century character model was based on an understanding of free will. Today, we know that free will is bounded. People can change their lives, but ordering change is not simple because many things, even within ourselves, are beyond our direct control. Much of our behavior, for example, is guided by unconscious habits. Researchers at Duke University calculated that more than 40 percent of the actions we take are governed by habit, not actual decisions. Researchers have also come to understand the structure of habits--cue, routine, reward. You can change your own personal habits. If you leave running shorts on the floor at night, that'll be a cue to go running in the morning. Don't try to ignore your afternoon snack craving. Every time you feel the cue for a snack, insert another routine. Take a walk. Their research thus implies a different character model, which is supposed to manipulate the neuralnetworks inside. To be an effective person, under this model, you are supposed to coolly examine your own unconscious habits, and the habits of those under your care. You are supposed to devise strategies to alter the cues and routines. Every relationship becomes slightly manipulative, including your relationship with yourself. You're trying to arouse certain responses by implanting certain cues. This is a bit disturbing, because the important habitual neural networks are not formed by mere routine, nor can they be reversed by clever cues. They are burned in by emotion and strengthened by strong yearnings, like the yearnings for admiration and righteousness. If you think you can change your life in a clever way, the way an advertiser can get you to buy an air freshener, you're probably wrong. As the Victorians understood, if you want to change your life, don't just look for a clever cue. Commit to some larger global belief.	"[""Habit plays a vital role in one's behavior.""]"

We can infer from the passage that _ .	"Last night I drove a long way (about 500 km) to return home. It was late and I was driving fast because I wanted to get home as soon as possible. So several times when I was driving behind a slow-moving truck on a narrow road, I wanted to shout at the driver ahead. Then I came to a crossroad with a traffic light. As I drove near, it turned red. I stopped my car at once. I looked left,right and behind. I found no cars or persons -- I was alone on the road. The person who would come to the crossroad was at least a mile away in any direction. Certainly going through the light would cause no danger. I could pass the traffic light. But strangely enough, I just stopped there, waiting for several minutes until the light went green. I asked myself why I refused to run the light. Surely it was unnecessary for me to be afraid of danger or being fined , because there were no cars or police around at all. But I remained waiting until the light changed. When I finally got home, it was near midnight. My wife had fallen asleep. The question of why I stopped for that light came back to me again, because I stopped another two times for the red lights as ""special"" as the first one. I stopped, not because of the law, but because it was a good habit I had developed. In fact, we were used to doing something right just because we have made obeying the rules a good habit. We do it just because we should do it. I thought if another man met with the same thing, he would make the same choice. I believed so. And I could be trusted by others. I believed that everyone would and could control himself/herself well. It was amazing that we trusted each other to do the right things, wasn't it?"

The dog held the visitor's hat in his mouth to show that _ .	Almost everyone likes dogs, and almost everyone likes reading stories about dogs. I have a friend. The friend has a large police dog. Its name is Jack. Police dogs are often very clever. Every Sunday afternoon my friend takes Jack for a long walk in the park. Jack likes these long walks very much. One Sunday afternoon a young man came to visit my friend. He stayed a long time. He talked and talked. Soon it was time for my friend to take Jack for his walk. But the visitor still stayed. Jack became very worried. He walked around the room several times and then sat down in front of the visitor and looked at him. But the visitor paid no attention. He continued talking. Finally Jack couldn't stand it. He went out of the room and came back a few minutes later. He sat down again in front of the visitor but this time he held the visitor's hat in his mouth and ran out of the room.	['he wanted the visitor to leave immediately']
What is the purpose of writing the passage?	"In the frozen continent of Antarctica scientists fear an alien invasion -- not from outer space, but carried in people's pockets and bags. Seeds and plants accidentally brought to Antarctica by tourists and scientists may introduce alien plant species which could threaten the survival of native plants in the finely balanced ecosystem. ""The people that were carrying the most had lots and lots of seeds. They really were real threats,"" said Dana Bergstrom, from the Australian Antarctic Division. ""When we take things in through hitchhiking then we get species which are competitive. The plants and animals there are not necessarily competitive, so we'd start losing various precious biodiversity on the (Antarctic) continent"", Bergstrom told Reuters. Amongst the alien species discovered were the Iceland Poppy, and Annual Winter Grass -- all from cold climates and capable of growing in Antarctica. The Antarctic Peninsula, where most tourists travel, is now considered a ""hot spot"" on the frozen continent and the warmer the climate, the easier for seeds to grow. ""The peninsula is warming at some of the greatest rates on the planet,"" said Bergstrom. The study, the first continent-wide assessment of invasive species in Antarctica, surveyed about 1,000 passengers during 2007-2008, the first year of the International Polar Year, an international effort to research the polar areas. Bergstrom said the one alien seed that had gained a foothold is Annual Winter Grass. It is a strong weed in the sub-Antarctic and is on the Antarctic island of King George. It has also made its way to the tail part of the Antarctic continent."	['To warn people of the danger of alien plant seeds to Antarctica.']
What is TRUE of NASDAQ?	NASDAQ, acronym for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system, is one of the largest markets in the world for the trading of stocks. The number of companies listed on NASDAQ is more than that on any of the other stock exchange in the United States, including the New York Stock Exchange(NYSE) and the American Stock Exchange (AMSE). The majority of companies listed on NASDAQ are smaller than most of those on the NYSE and AMSX. NASDAQ has become known as the home of new technology companies, particularly computer and computer-related businesses. Trading on NASDAQ is started by stock brokers acting on behalf of their clients. The brokers negotiate with market makers who concentrate on trading specific stocks to reach a price for the stock. Unlike other stock exchange, NASDAQ has no central location where trading takes place. Instead, its market makers are located all over the country and make trades by telephone and via the Internet. Because brokers and market makers trade stocks directly instead of on the floor of a stock exchange, NASDAQ is called an over-the-counter market. The term over-the -counter refers to the direct nature of the trading, as in a store where goods are handed over a counter. Since its inception in 1971, the NASDAQ Stock Market has been the innovator . As the world's first electronic stock market, NASDAQ long ago set a precedent for technological trading innovation that is unrivaled . Now ready to become the world's first truly global market, the NASDAQ Stock Market is the market of choice for business industry leaders worldwide. By providing an efficient environment for raising capital NASDAQ has helped thousands of companies achieve their desired growth and successfully make the leap into public ownership.

Which of the following is TRUE according to this passage?	Cars are lots of fun, but they could also be dangerous. We have to be careful when we drive them or ride in them. It's always a good idea to put on your seat belt when you're in a car. Why? Think about this example: You put an egg on a skateboard and give it a push. If the skateboard hits a stone, it will stop, but the egg won't. It will fly through the air, hit the ground and break. Now, think what would happen if you tied the egg to the skateboard. When the skateboard hits a stone, the egg won't go flying; it will stay safely on the skateboard. Volvo, a famous Swedish carmaker, was the first to use seat belts in 1849. Air bags are also very important for car safety, because sometimes a seat belt isn't enough. If the car is going really fast and runs into something, seat belts could even hurt the people who wear them. Most new cars have air bags in front of and next to the seats. When a car hits something, its air bags will come out quickly in less than one second to keep the people inside safe.	['Volvo was the first to use seat belts.']
People who are usually chosen to take part in the experiments are_.	It is well-known that when an individual joins a group, he tends to accept the group's standards of behavior and thinking. Many illustrations could be given of this from everyday life, but what is of particular interest to psychologists is the extent to which people's judgments and opinions can be changed as a result of group pressure, Asch and others noticed that people in a group will agree to statements that are contrary to the evidence of their senses. It would be a mistake to think that only particularly docile people are chosen to take part in experiments of this type. Usually highly intelligent and independent people are used. In a typical experiment, this is what may happen. The experimenter asks for volunteers to join a group which is investigating visual perception .The victims are not, therefore, aware of the real purpose of the experiment. Each volunteer is taken to a room where he finds a group of about seven people who are cooperating with the experimenter. The group is shown a standard card which contains a single line. They are then asked to look at a second card. This has three lines on it. One is obviously longer than the line on the first card; one is shorter and one the same length. They have to say which line on the second card is the same length as the line on the standard card. The other members of the group answer first but what the volunteer does not know is that they have been told to pick one of the wrong lines. When his turn comes, he is faced with the unanimous opinion of the rest of the group-all the others have chosen line A but he quite clearly sees line B as correct. What will be do? According to Asch, more than half of the vietims chosen will change their opinion. What is equally surprising is that, when interviewed about their answers, most explained that they knew the group choice was incorrect but that they gave in to the pressure of the group because they thought they must be suffering from an optical illusion , or because they were afraid of being different.

The passage is mainly developed by _ .	"On warm summer days with little or no wind, the air temperature in cities can be up to ten degrees higher than that of the surrounding countryside. This is a phenomenon commonly referred to as the ""urban heat island"" effect. This phenomenon happens when pavement, buildings, and other infrastructure replace natural land cover. _ Unlike soil, paved areas contribute to runoff, which means that as paved areas increase, the amount of water available for evaporation decreases. Moreover, urban areas have fewer trees and less natural vegetation which help to control the heat by providing shade and blocking solar radiation. The surfaces of leaves also provide water for evaporation which cools the air, further worsening the heat island effect. In particular, during summer, more energy is required to cool the insides of building and for refrigeration, thereby creating additional heat output. This in turn leads to higher ambient air temperatures, which can also significantly increase the formation of urban smog in an area, _ local air quality. Such a situation may directly affect public health with individuals more likely to suffer from heat exhaustion and the effects of asthma ."	['presenting the effect and analyzing the cause']

What is Shors'main purpose of her studies?	"A new study has discovered that meditation and oxygen sport together reduce depression .The Rutgers University study found that this mind and body combination, done twice a week for only two months,reduced the symptoms for a group of students by 40 percent. ""We are excited by the findings because we saw such a meaningful improvement in both clinically depressed and non--depressed students,""said lead author Dr.Brandon Alderman.""It is the first time that both of these two behavioral ways have been looked at together for dealing with depression."" Researchers believe the two activities have an interactive effect in _ depression.Alderman and Dr.Tracey Shors discovered that a combination of mental and physical training (MAP)enabled students with major depressive disorder not to let problems or negative thoughts defeat them. Rutgers researchers say those who participated in the study began with 30 minutes of focused attention meditation followed by 30 minutes of oxygen sport.They were told that if their thoughts drifted to the past or the future they should refocus on their breathing,enabling those with depression to accept moment-to-moment changes in attention. Shors,who studies the production of new brain cells in the hippocampus--part of the brain involved in memory and learning--says scientists have shown in animal models that oxygen sport exercise keeps a large number of certain cells alive. The idea for the human intervention came from her laboratory studies,she says,with the main goal of helping individuals acquire new skills so that they can learn to recover from stressful life events. By learning to focus their attention and exercise,people who are fighting depression can acquire new learning skills that can help them process information and reduce the overwhelming recollection of memories from the past,Shors says. ""We know these treatments can be practiced over a lifetime and that they will be effective in improving mental health.""said Alderman.""The good news is that this intervention can be practiced by anyone at any time and at no cost."""

We can infer from the text that _ .	"A growing number of health, hunger, and sustainable agriculture groups today announced plans for Food Day-a nationwide campaign to change the way Americans eat and think about food.Food Day will encourage people around the country to sponsor or participate in activities that encourage Americans to ""eat real"" and support healthy, affordable food grown in a sustainable, humane way. Organizers hope Food Day will inspire Americans to hold thousands of events in schools, college campuses, houses of worship and even in private homes aimed at fixing America's food system.A Food Day event could be as small as a parent organizing a vegetable identification contest at a kindergarten class-or as massive as a rally in a city park, with entertainment and healthy food.Health departments, city councils and other policy makers could use Food Day to launch campaigns, hold hearings, or otherwise address communities food problems. The campaign will advocate progress toward five central goals: *Reducing diet-related disease by promoting healthy foods.The American diet is too low in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and too high in fatty meat, soft drinks and salty packaged and restaurant foods-contributing to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths each year. *Supporting sustainable farms and stopping subsidies to agribusiness.Billions of federal dollars a year would be better spent helping environmentally conscious family farmers than hugeagribusiness operations. *Expanding access to food and alleviating hunger.Far too many Americans don't know where their next meal is coming from, or have access to fresh produce in their neighborhood. *Reforming factory farms to protect animals and the environment.Farming of animals can and should be done without cruelty, and without degrading the quality of life. *Curbing junk-food marketing to kids.Food companies should not be targeting children with foods that promote tooth decay, obesity and other health problems."

What is the netizens' attitude towards Ding's behavior?	"In May, 2014, some Chinese tourists found a Chinese-character message ""Ding Jinhao once visited here"" on a statue of god in a 3500-year-old Egyptian temple. An angry tourist took the photograph of the scrawl and posted it on social media Sina Weibo. It was quickly spread and there were more than 100,000 comments during two weeks. Later, a 15-year-old Chinese boy was searched out as the person who caved this message. Many netizens expressed their anger and disappointment for the uncivilized behavior. They searched and identified the boy and then posted his personal information including the address and pictures online. Over the weekend, his school's website was hacked, and reporters flooded into his home in the city of Nanjing. Besieged by reporters, the child's mother offered a formal apology for her son's behavior.

What's the main reason why the writer volunteers?	Why do I volunteer with Big brothers / Big sisters of America? I have many reasons. Perhaps the biggest reason is that people once volunteered to help me. Years ago, I was on the other side of the table. I was lonely and I felt lost. It's a little embarrassing to talk about it now, but whatever the right direction in life was, I was going the opposite way. More than once, I found myself on the wrong path. If someone hadn't stepped in when he did, I probably wouldn't even be here now. I'd rather be in a prison or somewhere a lot smaller and deeper. I've seen the work that big brothers / sisters have been doing all over the country and I'm pleased to be part of it. I've never done anything that made me prouder than my volunteer work. Big brothers and sisters helped me get over sadness and depression as soon as possible. Then, if I can help anyone like they helped me, I am willing to serve for as long as they will have me serve them. There are no words to describe the joy I get from helping somebody turn their life around. Every time I think that that's me now, I'm proud and happy. Volunteering is how I want to leave my mark on the world. I recommend volunteering work to everybody, especially to somebody who isn't sure where they are going in life. Helping someone find their path is often the best way to find yours. Be a volunteer, and you will find your purpose in life.	['He is grateful for what volunteers once did for him.']
Why does Jeffrey Dinslage suggest planting bare-root roses?	"Most kinds of rose plants come from Asia. But roses are also native to other areas including northwest Africa, Europe and the United States. In 1986, Congress chose the rose as America's national flower. Technically, Congress and President Ronald Reagan declared it the ""national floral emblem."" Whatever the name, the decision did not smell sweet to supporters of others popular flowers. Some people say roses are difficult to grow. But you have a good chance of success if you start with a few suggestions from experts. You should plant your roses where they can get sunshine for about six hours on bright days. You can buy roses form a garden center or by mail order. You can buy potted roses, also known as container roses, or bare-root plants. Each kind has its fans. Some gardeners say potted roses are easier to plant. They say the roots develop better. But Jeffrey Dinslage, an expert, pint out that bare-root roses come without soil. So they weigh less to transport. Another expert advises getting bare-foot roses as close to planting time as you can. If they arrive before you are ready to plant them, make sure the packing material is moist. Keep the plants in a cool, dark place. The resting plants have no leaves but still need water. When growing roses, the soil should feel _ deep down. Watering should be done in the morning. But do not water too much. People often ask Jeffrey Dinslage about unhealthy discoloration on rose leaves. He says the spots are usually caused by too much water. After heavy rains or too much watering, he advises pulling away mulch, the substance used to protect the roots, temporarily from around the roots. This will help dry the soil."

What is the author's attitude towards walking school bus?	"About ten days ago, I started to write an article on a parenting subject. I wish I could publish it. But in the days between the writing and the publishing, an unfortunate thing happened. My article discussing the lost art of walking to school was finished three days before an 8-year-old boy named Leiby Kletzky in Brooklyn tried to walk home for the first time from his summer camp. Today I will not describe the details around the Leiby Kletzky killing, except to point out the obvious fact that it terrified every parent who heard about it. What happened this week is one of the biggest reasons why so few kids walk to school now. In theory, walking to school is a wonderful habit, which can teach children independence, introduce them to their neighborhoods and encourage physical activity. It's better for the environment, eases traffic and is just generally the most fun choice. However, many of us parents don't allow the habit, mentioning the problems of logistics and distance. What we talk about less often is our fear. Maybe that's the heart of the matter. Indeed, it is an understandable reaction. But it is not a necessary one. What happened this week is extremely rare. Separating out the fact from the feelings is a difficult thing to do. Very few of us were ready to breathe easy about sending our young children off by themselves no matter what happened. We are far more worried now. The good news is that we don't have to be. Those children who go to school by themselves can be escorted when the neighborhood forms a ""walking school bus"". That's when designated parents walk with groups of children from home to school. With the benefit of safety, it allows kids to enjoy one of the joys of childhood. It's an easy, affordable choice. A walking school bus is a good idea that parents thought of. Proper measures are usually out there. Sometimes all they take is a little cooperation and some courage."	['Supportive.']

Rooms such as those inside the Belgian Suite contain chandeliers , gold-gilded mirrors, fireplaces, canopy beds, and more. 6. TOP- SECRET TUNNELS Rumor has it that secret underground tunnels connect the royal residence to other buildings in London.

What can be included from the passage?	The time of year a baby is born can shape what profession they will _ in later life, a new study has suggested. Being born in a certain month appears to indicate the possibility of what job a person will end up with, the study by the Office for National Statistics found. Researchers have uncovered that the month in which babies are born could also affect everything from intelligence to length of life. A child born in December is more likely to become a dentist while someone whose birthday falls in January will tend to a debt collector, they found. A February birth appears to increase the chances of being an artist while March babies appear to go on to become pilots. Meanwhile, April and May are said to have a fairly even spread of professions, births in the summer months mean a much lower chance of becoming a high-earning football player, doctor or dentist. The study was gained by researchers who analyzed the birth months of people in 19 separate occupations using information from the last census , the Daily Mail reported. Although these trends may be difficult to explain, relations between birth months and specific health problems have a scientific basis. Spring babies are at greater risk of illnesses including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, asthma and autism. They may also be less clever than classmates born in other parts of the year.

He beat 34,000 candidates from 200 countries in an online competition that became something of an Internet phenomenon. ""To go away now as the island caretaker for Tourism Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef is an extreme honour. I hope I can fill the boots as much as everybody is expecting, my swimming hopefully is up to standard and I look forward to all of the new roles and responsibilities that the task involves."" [Ben Southall] For a disappointing Australian tourism industry currently in the _ , this has been an unexpected encouragement. Tourism Queensland deliberately chose the middle of winter of the northern globe to launch the campaign back in January, but didn't expect anywhere near the global response. They think the only countries where people didn't visit their website was North Korea and a few African nations. What's said to be the best job in the world comes with a $110,000 (about 750,000 yuan) contract for six months' work, a luxury beachside home and a plunge pool. In return, the island caretaker will be expected to stroll the white sands, enjoy the sun, diving and taking care of the reef, ""maybe clean the pool""-- and report to a global audience via weekly blogs , photo diaries and video updates. For the losers meanwhile, there's the worst of long journeys home."	['you need to surf the Internet regularly to know what Ben Southall is doing there']
What does Mr Brown like?	Mr Brown is our English teacher at school. He is a popular teacher and I like him very much. There are many other foreign teachers in our school. Some are from English-speaking countries and some from Asian countries. I like Mr Brown best. He is a very interesting teacher and he teaches us very well. Mr Brown comes from Australia. Though he is the oldest teacher of our school. he is very strong. All the students like him very much. During his class, no one sleeps. After class, he often tells jokes to us or does sports with us. Mr Brown likes music very much. We learn a lot of English songs from him. He is also fond of sports. He takes exercises at least three times a week. He is good at swimming, so you know why he looks so strong.	['He likes music.']
Stress level is closely related to .	"People with less education suffer fewer stressful days,according to a report in the current issue of the Journal of Health and Social Behavior. However,the study also found that when lesseducated people did suffer stress it was more severe and had a larger impact on their health. From this researchers have concluded that the daytoday factors that cause stress are not random .Where you are in society determines the kinds of problems that you have each day,and how well you will deal with them. The research team interviewed a national sample of 1,031 adults daily for eight days about their stress level and health.People without a high school diploma reported stress on 30 percent of the study days,people with a high school degree reported stress 38 percent of the time,and people with college degrees reported stress 44 percent of the time. ""Less advantaged people are less healthy on a daily basis and are more likely to have downward turns in their health.""lead researcher Dr.Joseph Grzywacz,of Wake Forest University Medical Center,said in a prepared statement.""The downward turns in heBaptistalth were connected with daily stressors and the effect of daily stressors on their health is much more devastating for the less advantaged."" Grzywacz suggested followup research to determine why lesseducated people report fewer days of stress when it is known that their stress is more acute(severe)and chronic (lasting). ""If something happens every day,maybe it's not seen as a stressor""Grzywacz says.""Maybe it is just life."""	['social status']
Which of the following is suggested by the writer ?	Smartphones, poor sight Look around and you'll see people busy on their smartphones. Smartphones do make our lives easier . But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of British people own smartphones and they spend an average of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the UK who suffer from shortsightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at things closer to your face, the blinking slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphones in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger, too much light enters your eyes. This can do harm to the eyes and cause a disease called glaucoma . While you're probably not going to stop using to your _ , there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes. Hold your phone at least 30 centimeters away from your eyes when using it. Take a break every hour and try the following: look at something at least five meters from you and then focus on the tip of your nose. Repeat this several times. It should reduce the discomfort in your eyes.	"[""Don't use the phone for over an hour without a break.""]"
What is implied in the passage?	In the past, man did not have to think about protection of the environment. There were very few people on the earth, and natural resources seemed to be unlimited. Today things are different. The world has become too crowded. We are using up our natural resources too quickly, and at the same time we are polluting our environment with dangerous chemicals. If we continue to do this, human life on the earth will not survive. Everyone realizes today that if too many fish are taken from the sea, there will soon be none left. Yet, with modern fishing methods, more and more fish are caught. We know that if too many trees are cut down, forests will disappear and nothing will grow on land. Yet, we continue to use more powerful machines to cut down more and more trees. We realize that if rivers are polluted with waste products from factories, we will die. However, in most countries waste is still put into rivers, but there are few laws to stop this. We also know that if the population of the countries in the world is to rise at the present rate in a few years, there will not be enough food. What can we do to solve these problems? If we eat more vegetables and less meat, there will be more food available for everyone. Land that is used to grow crops can feed five times more people than land where animals are kept. Our natural resources will last longer if we learn to recycle them. The world population will not rise so quickly if people use modern methods of birth control. Finally, if all of us think about the problem, we will have a better and cleaner planet in the future.	"[""Man will destroy himself if he doesn't solve the problem.""]"
The driver always worked at night because it was easier to _ .	"This is a talk by a London taxi driver. ""I've been a taxi driver for nearly ten years. Most London taxi drivers have their own taxis."" ""It's a nice job most of time. You meet a lot of people. I always work at night, because there is too much traffic during the day.

""Some very strange things happened late at night .The other day I was taking a woman home from a party .She had her little dog with her.

The safest basic personal information that you can share online is .	"Of all the websites,one that has attracted attention recently is _ .Most of this attention has come from the media and tells every reason why the website should be shut down.The threat of internet predators is indeed a tough reality,but shutting down the site is not the answer.If _ were shut down,another site would quickly take its place.Therefore,the right way is to teach teens how to use the site safely and educate them about who may be predators and how to avoid them. The key to staying safe on the Internet is to make sure that your profile is secure.The simplest way is to change the privacy setting on your profile to ""private"", which protects your information so that only the people on your friend list can view it.Although this is effective,it is not perfect.Predators can find ways to view your profile if they really want to,whether through hacking in or figuring out their way onto your friend list.Thus,you should never post too much personal information.Some people actually post their home and school addresses,date of birth,and other personal information, often letting predators know exactly where they will be and when.The most information that is safe is your first name and province.Anything more is basically inviting a predator into your life. Another big issue is photos. I suggest completely skipping photos and never posting a photo of a friend online without asking permission. Most importantly, never,under any circumstances,agree to a real-life meeting with anyone you meet online.No matter how well you think you know this person, there are no guarantees that they have told the truth.But you could feel free to chat with people you meet on the site, but just remember that not everyone is who they say they are.Hopefully,the next time you edit your profile,you'll be more informed about the dangers of internet predators and take the steps to defend yourself."

Meteorologists forecast the weather _ .	Now satellites are helping to forecast the weather. They are in space and they can reach any part of the world. The satellites take pictures of the atmosphere , because this is where the weather forms . They send these pictures to the weather station. So meteorologists can see the weather of any part of the world. From the pictures, the scientists can often say how the weather will change. Today, nearly five hundred weather stations in sixty countries receive satellite pictures. When they receive new pictures, the meteorologists compare them with earlier ones. Perhaps they may find that the clouds have changed during the last few hours .This may mean the weather on the ground may soon change, too. In their next weather forecast, the meteorologists can say this. So the weather satellites are a great help to the meteorologists. Before satellites were invented, the scientists could forecast the weather for about 24 or 48 hours. Now they can make good forecasts for 3 or 5 days. Soon, perhaps , they may forecast the weather for a week or more ahead	['after they have compared new satellite pictures with earlier ones']
How many lives could probably be saved each year in the United States by eating fish according to the Dutch study?	A small piece of fish each day may keep the heart doctor away. That's the finding of an extensive study of Dutch men in which deaths from heart disease were more than 50 percent lower among those who consumed at least an ounce of salt water fish per day than those who never ate fish. The Dutch research is one of three human studies that give strong scientific backing to the long-held belief that eating fish can provide health benefits, particularly to the heart. Heart disease is the number-one killer in the United States , with more than 550, 000 deaths occurring from heart attacks each year . But researchers previously have noticed that the incidence of heart disease is lower in cultures that consume more fish than Americans do. There are fewer heart disease deaths, for example, among the Eskimos of Greenland, who consume about 14 ounces of fish a day, and among the Japanese, whose daily fish consumption averages more than 3 ounces. During the next two decades, 78 of the men died from heart disease. The fewest deaths were among the group who regularly ate fish, even at levels far lower than those of the Japanese or Eskimos. This relationship was true regardless of other factors such as age , high blood pressure , or blood cholesterol levels .	['275,000.']
What did Fierer's team find through the study?	"Look closely at ,your hands-are they clean? It doesn't matter how many times you was your hands. They're still crowded with microbes, which are also called ""germs"" or ""bacteria"". Microbes are everywhere. But don't worry-most microbes don't harm you. and many actually help you stay alive. Now, scientists say the microbes that live on our hands could be used in a surprising way: fighting crime. When police visit the scene of a crime, they often look for fingerprints to try to identifythe criminal. But according to a recent study, investigators could even use microbes to help break a criminal case. Every person has his or her own set of microbes that live on their hands, according to scientists at,the University of:Colorado. That means the mix of different kinds of microbes on everybody's hand is unique-much like one's fingerprint. The scientists wanted to know whether this microbe mix could be used as a new kind of fingerprint-especially in a crime scene where fingerprints might be hard to find. And policemen use forensics such as studying fingerprints to identify the criminal. ""Microbe fingerprints are harder to hide,"" said Noah Fierer, one of the scientists. ""You can't sterilize(......) a surface just by wiping it off. "" His team compared the bacteria on the hands of 273 people with the bacteria found on each person's computer keyboard. For the study, the keyboards had been used only by the people who were being tested. The study showed that the mix of microbes from each per- son's hands matched the mix of microbes on that person's keyboard. The scientists were easily able to tell the 273 people apart-just by looking at their keyboards. But there are a lot more than 273 criminals. Other scientists wonder whetherthe microbe fingerprint can really be that useful. Fierer agrees that scientists have a lot more work to do before the microbe fingerprint will be a useful tool."

Which of the following is TRUE according to the story?	"She is a cute , quiet girl. As a daughter, she has no secrets from her mother, who is very pleased with her. But recently she has become somewhat mysterious, not so open as before: what if she falls in love, which is too early for a girl of her age. After all, she is reaching the ""dangerous stage"". These thoughts have caused trouble in the mother' mind. One weekend the girl came to tell her mother that she was going to the cinema with her schoolmates and would return late. This was the first time her mother had agreed , and she couldn't help worrying because her daughter had never been away at night before. The mother waited till nine and her uneasiness got the upper hand over her. She decided to go out to meet her daughter. Just at that moment the noise of a car pulling up drew her to the window and ------there was her daughter, waving goodbye to a boy. Her heart missed a beat. When the girl came in, the mother was watching TV, pretending nothing had happened. ""Mum, I'm back."" ""Yeah."" ""Sorry to be late. Still sitting up?"" ""Yes, Oh, that... Who's that boy?"" The daughter was stunned for a moment. ""Ah. It's my monitor. He gave a lift on his way home. Mum, I'm going to bed"" ""All right. Go to sleep early."" Next morning, when the mother went to the daughter's room to do some tidying, she found her diary left at her pillow. After a few minutes' hesitation she finally opened it to the entry of the night before. It read: Mum, it was love that made you ask, but it would show your understanding of me if you hadn't. Holding the diary, the mother fell in thought."	['What the girl did recently worried her mother.']
What does this passage mainly tell use	"Now if you go out or surf(;)the Internet, one word is very popular among young people. That is the word ""fashion"". But lots of young people don't know what it really means. They just think an iPhone 6 is fashionable, new hair style is fashionable, a new kind of clothes is fashionable, and even smoking or drinking is fashionable. So they just try to do something to make themselves look fashionable. These young people often do something wrong. Some children buy cigarettes and smoke them without letting their teachers or parents know. Some students learn to drink and it costs them a lot of money. Some children want their parents to buy them mobile phones, but they just use their phones to play games and chat with their friends. Some young students like to run after ""fashionable"" stars. They often do their best to see music stars and sometimes they have to go far away to see the stars face to face. They often have to look everywhere for the information of the ""fashionable"" stars. But many other people don' t think so. They think fashion means everything modern and useful things to people around us. Children should try to be really fashionable."	['What is real fashion.']
The writer got the letter _ years ago.	"When I tidied up some old boxes under my bed, I found an old letter for me from my best friend. Her name was Minnie. In the letter, Minnie wrote, ""I am really sorry about before. Tell me if you will be my best friend again and tell me if you accept my _ . ""I wrote, ""YES. I will be your best friend. "" The twelve-year-old letter made me remember the time that Minnie and I spent together. We often wrote to each other during that time. One minute, Minnie and I would be playing happily together; the other moment we would get into arguments. But things would always be better again. She gave me a doll for my tenth birthday. I still keep it. Finally things changed. We stopped writing letters to each other after she moved away, and I could no longer ride my bike to her house. Years later, she invited me to her sixteenth birthday party. I don't see Minnie very often from then on. But I'll always keep the letter and I'll never forget the time we spent together."	['12']

The passage is about _ .	American country music is very old. It came from the United States, Canada, Ireland, and Great Britain. It's a mixture of music from all of these places. In West America, cowboys had to take care of the cattle. They had to watch them all day and all night because the cattle sometimes ran away. A cowboy's life was lonely and dangerous. When he was alone in the desert with the cattle, he drank strong coffee to stay awake at night. He sang about the stars and the moon, about his family and his friends. The cattle listened to the cowboy and went to sleep. They didn't run away if he sang beautiful songs. In South America, many people came from Ireland and England. Other people came from France and Canada. They enjoyed their own kind of music. When they visited their friends and families on holidays like Christmas, they usually sang and played country music. American country music describes life. It talks about love, jobs, home and money. People in many parts of the world like western country music because everyone knows something about these ideas.

In the passage, we are told that _ .	It was a rainy day and I was walking down the street feeling comfortable and happy. I wanted to do something kind for someone else without any reason and purpose, almost as if I was just trying to spread the abundance of love I was receiving. It was then that I saw a teenage girl dressed in _ clothes, getting soaked . She wasn't wearing any shoes or socks. The rain wet her skin through the holes in her clothes and she was making her way through the garbage, trying to find something that would be of use to her. I walked towards her and told her to wait for me there while I ran home to get her something. On getting home, I took off my shoes, which I really loved, wrapped them up in a plastic cover and ran to give them to the teenage girl on the street. The girl looked surprised as if she was not used to this kind of kindness. She thanked me in a trembling voice. A famous musician who lives down the street corner stopped his car and smiled when he saw what happened. The two watchmen who saw me do this talked and gave me friendly looks. Although I had to wear my dad's shoes, I was satisfied even if they were a bit large for my feet, because I knew the girl would walk comfortably wearing the shoes. That day I learned that letting go of the little things we own can be a big help to others.	['the author was very kind-hearted.']
The author attributes the unhappiness felt by security guards, truck drivers and sales people to _ .	Security guard, truck driver, salesperson--year after year, these jobs appear on lists of the unhappiest careers. Although many factors can make a job unhappy, unusual hours, low pay, nochance for advancement -- these three gigs stand out for another reason: a lack of small talk. Psychologists have long said that connecting with others is central to well-being, but just how much conversation we require is under investigation. In one study, researchers eavesdropped on undergraduates for four days, then cataloged each overheard conversation as either small talk (What do you have there? Popcorn?(Yummy!) or serious (So did they get divorced soon after?). They found that the second type related with happiness--the happiest students had roughly twice as many serious talks as the unhappiest ones. Small talk, meanwhile, made up only 10 percent of their conversation, versus almost 30 percent of conversation among the least content students. However, don't just consider chat worthless yet. Scientists believe that small talk could promote linking. Chatting with strangers could brighten your morning. In a series of experiments, psychologists gave Chicago travelers varying directions about whether to talk with fellow train passengers something they typically avoided. Those told to chat with others reported a more pleasant journey than those told to enjoy your being alone or to do whatever they normally would. None of the chatters reported being rejected. And the results held for introverts and extroverts alike which makes sense, since acting extroverted has a positive effect on introverts. Small talk can also help us feel connected to our surroundings. People who smiled at, made eye contact with, and briefly spoke with their Starbucks reported a greater sense of belonging than those who rushed through the business. Similarly, one not yet published paper found that when volunteers broke the silence of the Tate Modern to chat with gallery goers, the visitors felt happier and more connected to the exhibit than those who were not approached. So go ahead, pry. Chitchat needn't be idle. And nosiness isn't all bad.	['a lack of small talk']
How many students are mentioned in the passage?	"A group of senior high school students are playing outside on a basketball court. They are shouting with excitement. And they all have the same dream. They wish to play in the NBA, just like Huston Rocket's Yao Ming. ""Someday, there will be more Chinese players like Yao in the NBA,"" said 15-year-old Xie Tao, a senior 1 boy at Shanghai No. 2 Middle School. Xie always watches Yao playing on TV. ""He is a great player. He makes me proud to be Chinese,"" he said. Like Xie, 17-year-old Liu Yan at Beijing No. 22 Middle School is also a big NBA fan. ""Since early May, I've not missed one game in the NBA,"" said the senior 3 student. Basketball is becoming popular in middle schools across the country. And more young players are starting to like the sport. More students are playing the game. Jiang Hui, a basketball teacher at Beijing No. 2 Middle School, said that 85 percent of the students at this school like the sport. ""Students are full of passion for the game,"" Jiang's team won the regional first prize in the 2004 National High School Boy's Basketball League in march. The league is the first national basketball competition for high school students. Playing basketball is a good way to exercise. But students also enjoy it for other reasons. For Li Yan, a Senior 2 at Shanghai No. 12 Middle School, basketball teaches him lessons in life. ""When I am in a game, I feel more confident about my studies, "" he said. "" It also teaches me to have a good team spirit and to enjoy friendship."""	['3']
We can learn from the passage that _ .	"What can help you make a fortune in the future? Graduating from a top university might not be enough. A new study from the University of Essex in Britain has shown that the more friends you have in school, the more money you'll earn later. The idea that popularity could have a serious impact on one's earning potential shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. The researchers noted that if you want to get ahead in life, social skills and networking are easily as powerful as talent and hard work. ""If a person has lots of friends, it means that he or she has the ability to get along with others in all kinds of different situations,"" said Xu Yanchun, 17, from Nantou High School in Shenzhen, who totally agreed with the recent finding. ""Also, friends always help each other. They not only create wider social circles for you but lift your mood when you occasionally feel depressed,"" said Xu. She believed that all this helps you ""earn a higher salary"". Maybe that's why some people think the younger generations are in the age of Friendalholism . A woman even complained that the networking website Facebook's 5,000-friend limit was too low for her large reserve of social contacts. But what does a friend mean? Should friends be regarded as a form of currency? ""Call me uncool, but I think of a friend as an actual person with whom I have an actual history and whom I enjoy actually seeing. It seems, however, that this is no longer the definition of 'friend',"" said Meghan Daum, who works with the Los Angeles Times in the US."

Which of the following words best describes the writer's mother?	"When I was seven years old my mom was diagnosed with cancer. The doctors told us my mom might be saved with surgery. But it could also kill her. She chose to have it. The day before the surgery I was off school, and my mom planned the best day of my life, everything I loved at seven and everything that would put a smile on my face. The day began with her waking me up saying, ""Kate, I have a surprise for you. Come and see."" The surprise was a doll I had wanted for the longest time. Throughout the day, she told me everything that she thought I would need to know to grow up and be a good person; she told me to be the best I could be and that I would always make her proud. We had a picnic in the park, and it was so cold that we moved to the car. The day was filled with laughter. For the first time in a long time I could see she was really happy. I would never forget her smile, or the way her eyes shone as if we were the same age. It was the best day of my life, and I will never forget the conversations we shared. My mother managed to live through the surgery. Now when I look back, I realize that the best day of my life could be her last and this could be the last day I would remember with her, the last one we shared. I also understand how unselfish a mother is."	['Great.']
We can probably find this passage in _ .	"Experts know that a disaster is coming but they do not know when it will happen. They do know that it could cause a lot of damage. They think it will be worse than a hurricane. The disaster they are worried about is an earthquake. There is a break in the earth's crust . It is called the San Andreas Fault. The San Andreas Fault is in California. Many earthquakes happen along the San Andreas Fault. In 1989 there was a big earthquake on the fault. The earthquake was called the ""Loma Prieta Earthquake"". Many people were hurt or died. Many buildings were ruined. Lots of people lost their homes. Roads and bridges were also damaged. A large earthquake could happen in Southern California. Many small earthquakes have happened in the last year. Earthquake experts think that a large earthquake will happen there soon. They think a big earthquake will happen in the next few years. The San Andreas Fault has many power lines stretched across it. There are water channels close to the earthquake fault. A large earthquake in Southern California would destroy energy and water supplies . Lots of people would be without power or water for weeks. Buildings that have not been built strong enough would be destroyed. Not all hospitals would be able to help people who were injured. Many people would die or be homeless. People need to be prepared. They need to know what to do if an earthquake happens. Everyone in California should have a survival kit at home. The emergency kit would include food and water. There should be medication and first aid supplies in the kit. A good survival kit will also have a portable radio, flashlights and spare batteries. All of the supplies in the kit should last at least 3 days."	['a science book']
In the process of children's learning new skills, parents _ .	"In bringing up children, every parent watches eagerly the child's acquisition of each new skill -- the first spoken words, the first independent steps, or the beginning of reading and writing. It is often tempting to hurry the child beyond his natural learning rate, but this can set up dangerous feelings of failure and states of worry in the child. This might happen at any stage. A baby might be forced to use a toilet too early, a young child might be encouraged to learn to read before he knows the meaning of the words he reads. On the other hand, though, if a child is left alone too much, or without any learning opportunities, he loses his natural enthusiasm for life and his desire to find out new things for himself. Parents vary greatly in their degree of strictness towards their children. Some may be especially strict in money matters. Others are severe over time of coming home at night or punctuality for meals. In general, the controls represent the needs of the parents and the values of the community as much as the child's own happiness. As regards the development of moral standards in the growing child, consistency is very important in parental teaching. To forbid a thing one day and excuse it the next is no foundation for morality . Also, parents should realize that ""example is better than _ "". If they are not sincere and do not practice what they preach , their children may grow confused when they grow old enough to think for themselves, and realize they have been to some extent fooled. A sudden awareness of a marked difference between their parents' principles and their morals can be a dangerous disappointment."

Otherwise there will be serious problems on Earth like natural disasters. The agreement also asks countries to volunteer to make promises based on each country's economy , politics and technology. For developed countries, they will do even more. They have a plan to offer over $100 billion (about 647 billion yuan) to help poorer countries develop clean energy like water and wind power. Besides, there are some legally binding rules. Those countries need to set national goals for cutting greenhouse gas emissions every five years. And they will publicly report their progress every five years starting in 2023. However, the Paris Agreement alone won't solve the climate change problem. The future depends on how well each country will carry out their promises.	['climate change']
We can learn from the passage that Melody Cramer _ .	One of those big social networking sites, Facebook, has attracted over 58 million members. Commentator Melody Cramer is no longer one of them. Here is what she shares with us about her story. I deleted all 1,281 of my co!workers, second!grade classmates and people who I don't know at all. I shut down my account, completely. I'm 30, and I've been on Facebook since March of 2004, which makes me one of the website's earliest users. At first, I used it obsessively. If I had a free moment, I'd log on to see whether my friends had updated their profiles. I'd sit alone scrolling through these updates and then run into someone at a coffee shop and have nothing to say because I already knew everything about them, and they knew everything about me. In November, I went to my ten!year high school reunion and was not pleasantly surprised. Lauren became a model, Josh went to law school, Dina was a teacher. I hadn't talked to any of them since graduation, but I knew exactly what they were doing, both now and last week. But lately, I'm overwhelmed . Facebook opened up to everyone, not just college students, and my co!workers started to join, which meant they now knew what I was doing when I wasn't at work. And as a rule: you can NOT make friends with your coworkers because then they'll ask you the next day. But I thought we were friends. And you are friends but not the kind of friends who tell each other what they do outside of work. So now the people you work with can see what you did last night, and you're constantlyworrying what people might say about what you did last night instead of actually doing anything tonight.So I quit. I became a 30!year!old Luddite, a person who is strongly against technology development. I've returned to how the world worked when I was 20, before I knew when my friends and co!workers were counting down the seconds to vacation or entering a complicated relationship. I'm hoping life will be a lot simpler now. People will be more mysterious now that I actually have to talk to them to find out their favorite books or hobbies orneurosis . I don't know when my college roommate goes to the supermarket, and I think I'm a better person for not knowing. In fact, you could say getting off a social network was the best thing I've done this week.	['had a 10!year membership of Facebook']
Glass walls of skyscrapers are specially mentioned in order to _ .	In the late 1970's,many people in North America turned their attention to environmental problems ,and new steel -- and -- glass skyscrapers were widely criticized. Some ecologists pointed out that a number of tall buildings in a city often overburden public transportation. Skyscrapers are also _ of electric power and water. In just one recent year, the addition of 17 million square feet of skyscraper office space in New York City itself has already raised the top daily demand for electricity by 120, 000 kw -- enough to supply the entire city of Albany in New York area for a single day. Glass--walled skyscrapers can also be especially wasteful. The heat loss ,or gain, through a wall of half inch plate glass is more than ten times that through a typical ordinary wall filled with bricks or board. In order to decrease the pressure on heating and air -- conditioning equipment, builders of skyscrapers have begun to use double--layered glass ,and reflective glasses coated with silver or gold mirror films that could reduce glare as well as heat gain. However, mirror -- walled skyscrapers may raise the temperature of the surrounding air and affect neighboring buildings as well. Skyscrapers put a severe pressure on a city's sanitation facilities, too. If fully occupied, the towers just within the central area of New York would alone produce 2. 25 million gallons of waste water each year^--as much as the city size of Stanford, Connecticut, which has a population of more than 109,000.

The author's tone in this passage can best be described as _	"To the Editor, I have been reading your newspaper,the Hometown Gazette, for the past two years, ever since I moved to Smithville. We moved here from New York City, so I am accustomed to reading excellent newspapers such asThe New York Times . In fact, we still havethe Timesdelivered on Sundays. The entire family enjoys reading the recipes in the magazine, as well as the Styles section. The Times is great, butthe Gazetteis another story. I've never read an article that doesn't contain at least three or four spelling or grammatical errors. For instance, in last week's issue you misspelled the word ""secretary"", used a singular verb with a plural noun, and used ""it's"" as a possessive . And that was just in the lead story! In case you never went to elementary school, ""it's"" means ""it is "".It's also a possessive adjective! It's a pity that this tiny little hick town has only one newspaper, because I'd like to have an alternative to the rag you publish. I find it hard to believe your news stories. If you can't spell correctly. How can you get your facts right? I've been meaning to get this off my chest for some time. Please cancel my subscription . And buy yourself a dictionary. Sincerely, Jane Z, Jones"	['angry']
"According to the text, we can infer the ""child"" is in fact _ ."	Dear mommy and daddy, I write this letter to you in hopes that you should consider your method of parenting me before I arrive. I am a joyous child. I expect love and respect, order and discipline. When I arrive, I will seem very small to you. Even though I don't look like an adult, please understand that I am a human being. Even though I will not speak words to you, I will know you with my heart. I will feel all your feelings, absorb your thoughts. I will come to know you more than you may know yourself. Do not be misled by my silence. I am open, growing and learning more rapidly than you can imagine. I will keep in heart all that I see, so please give me sweet music and language that tells me how much I am loved. Give me silence to rest my ears. I will absorb all that I feel, so please wrap life in love. I am waiting patiently to be with you. I am so happy to have the opportunity to be alive. Maybe when you see me you will remember how precious life is too! Your joyous child	['an unborn baby']
When you break a vase at home, will you tell your parents according to American morals?	"Do Americans have morals ? That's a good question. Many people insist that ideas about right and wrong are merely personal opinions. Some voices, though, are calling Americans back to traditional moral values. William J. Bennett, former U.S. Secretary of Education, edited the Book of Virtues in 1993 to do just that. Bennett suggests that great moral stories can build character. The success of Bennett ' s book shows that many Americans still believe in moral values. But what are they? One of the most basic moral values for Americans is honesty. The well-known legend about George Washington and the cherry tree tells this value clearly. Little George cut down his father's favorite cherry tree while trying out his new axe. When his father asked him about it, George said honestly, ""I can not tell a lie. I did it with my axe."" Instead of punishment, George received his father's praise for telling the truth. Sometimes American honesty-being open and direct-can offend people. But Americans still believe that ""honesty is the best policy."" Another virtue Americans respect is perseverance. Remember Aesop's fable( )about the rabbit and the turtle that had a race? The rabbit thought he could win easily, so he took a nap. But the turtle finally won because he didn't give up. Sympathy may be the queen of American virtues. The story of ""The Good Samaritan"" from the Bible describes a man who showed sympathy. On his way to a certain city, a Samaritan man found a poor traveler lying on the road. The traveler had been beaten and robbed. The kind Samaritan, instead of just passing by, stopped to help this person in need. In no way can these brief descriptions cover all the moral values honored by Americans. Responsibility, loyalty, courage, gratitude and many others could be discussed. In fact, Bennett's bestseller-over 800 pages-highlights just 10 virtues. Even Bennett admits that he has only covered the surface. But no matter how long or short the list is, moral values are invaluable, they are the foundation of American culture-and any culture."

What's the best title of the passage?	Ladies and gentlemen, I returned to this year in a time machine. In the year 2500, we are able to travel through time to any year in the history of the earth. This year is your last chance your lifestyle to save the earth. Beginning in the middle of the 20th century, a few people were worried about polluting the earth's water and air, but most people did not change their way of life. Instead, they continued to pour dangerous chemical and other waste into lakes and seas, to drive more and more cars and trucks, and to cut down trees. By the year 2200, the earth's water was completely polluted. People could no longer drink water, and they had to use other types of liquids . Scientists said that in the future there might be too many people on the earth. But not enough was done. So by the year 2300, there were so many people that food became scarce. There was no water to grow food and all of the fish in lakes and seas died because of pollution. Terrible wars broke out between the rich and the poor. Scientists were working very hard to find another planet in space where humans could live. By the year 2400, the air was too polluted for humans to breathe. So we had to leave the earth. But only the rich were able to leave. Where did we go? Nowhere. And everywhere. You see scientists did not find another safe planet, so now we must travel around the universe in our space ships. We are still looking for a place to call our home. So it is up to you to change history. There is still hope. You must change your lifestyle now, before it is too late.	['Stop polluting']
When did the author and his brother notice the young man who had a flat tire?	"Last Friday my brother and I were driving home together after doing some shopping and gave our attention to an interesting conversation. Because of this distraction my brother took a wrong turn. Unfortunately, the wrong turn took us towards a bridge and we had no way to turn back. Unwillingly, my brother paid the bridge fee and drove on. He was clearly frustrated by the mistake and the needless waste of $4. We eventually reached an exit and, as we took it, my brother noticed a young fellow pulled over to the side of the road. He came out of his car and tried to phone someone. I was busy trying to figure out which way we would go next but my brother pulled over and asked the guy if he needed any help. And he did. He had a flat tire and needed a tool to get it off. My brother gave him a wrench, and then began to help him change the flat. The young man said that this had been a bad week for him: earlier he had gotten into a minor car accident, and now this flat on his way home from work. But he called us ""a breath of fresh air"" and kept thanking us because he really would have been stuck if we hadn't come along. After we finished the job he thanked us again and pulled out $20 from his pocket and tried to give it to us. ""No,"" I said. ""We were never supposed to even get on that bridge,we took a wrong turn. But now we know why we did. It was to help you. Thank you for turning our mistake into an opportunity to serve."" What I loved most was that my brother was able to see a chance to help. His reaction in the situation is a lesson for everyone and we felt so good the rest of the day."	['When they were passing through an exit.']
What is the author's opinion on homemade Christmas presents?	"This Christmas, maybe different from previous years, a strong desire drives me to make my own Christmas gifts. Honestly speaking, I've promised myself this more than once. As a crafter , I've frequently thought I am supposed to turn it into action. However, this year I really plan to stick to it. It's partly because I run short of money. More importantly, I've recently returned from an inspiring trip around Britain, collecting some information about crafting for BBC's Newsnight. Actually I planned the trip couples of months ago. The idea of traveling the country -- making things as I went, meeting artists and craftspeople -- sounded perfect to spend the summer. I'd pack a tent and a sewing machine and I'd set off. But by the time I determined my plans and hit the road, leaves made a sighing sound under foot. It seemed crazy to camp with winter on the way; Luckily, Newsnight viewers offered me accommodations in return for help with a craft task. My tasks ranged from sewing worn-out clothes to making trousers. Textile students in Harpenden offered to pay for my petrol in return for a talk about hats. In Derby, Amy needed help to change an old pair of curtains. I was really struck by people's increasing enthusiasm for making things. When I asked some people if they could sew, only a few raised their hands. But when I asked who wanted to learn, nearly everyone responded positively, hoping to learn something practical. Craft is definitely popular at the moment. But besides fashion, we're learning to appreciate effort and quality again. Perhaps once people rediscover the pleasure to be gained from making something unique, it may stick. Sue is director of quilts at the V&A, where next spring she'll be putting on the museum's first major quilting exhibition. Sue believes the return to crafting is related to how we rethink ourselves. ""People, especially women, are beginning to think about the way they live their lives. It's 40 years since the first women's liberation conference was held in Oxford. Since then we've been in the workplace, and we've had the opportunity of choice. Now we're carefully choosing to go back into the home."" Whether you agree with that or not, there's something about Christmas that brings out the artistic flavor in everyone. Whether it's baking bread or pies or decorating the halls or rooms, we're all prepared to have a try at any time. So if you fancy having a different and joyful party or holiday and making a few presents, try these really simple ideas, each inspired by my recent journey there. They make small and interesting gifts, and take no longer than 30 minutes each. Enjoy Christmas songs and settle down with a cup of hot cocoa, and the cold is gone. You'll save yourself a small quantity of money and spread a little bit of love, too!"	['People can find their artistic talent in making Christmas presents.']
Which part of a newspaper does the article come from?	"For most people,below--freezing temperatures generally put a stop to outdoor exercise,but Siberian native Boris Fyodorov is not most people. Minutes after the calendar ticked over to this past 2014 New Year's Eve,Fyodorov set off on a solo,out--and--back marathon run from his home in the Siberian village of Oymyakon,completing the 26.2-mile course-his first marathon-in just over five hours.During the run he experienced temperatures as low as -38oC. And that was just the way he wanted it. ""I heard about other marathons around the globe,naming themselves 'the coldest',like the most recent North Pole marathon with runners going at -28oC.'' Fyodorov told the Siberian Times.""I thought surely this cannot be right.Our Oymyakon is the coldest inhabited place in northern hemisphere.Why don't we arrange a marathon here?'' Oymyakon is widely considered to be one of the coldest places on the planet,and its record-low temperature of-68oC, recorded in 1933,is tied for the coldest recorded temperature for any inhabited place on Earth.The average January temperature in the area is -50oC. Not only did Fyodorov finish the marathon in high spirits,but he also wants it to be colder the next time he tries it.""I really want to organize next Oymyakon marathon in January when the air goes down to -50oC or -60oC,""he said. Fyodorov is not the first person to take on a cold--weather athletic challenge like this.In addition to the North Pole Marathon that he mentioned,the Antarctica Marathon is held every year in late February,taking runners on an out--and--back tour from Russia's Bellingshausen Station.A second Antarctica event--the Ice Marathon--has been held80F degrees south since 2006."

What is the author's attitude towards biomass fuels?	Across countryside, non-food crops are growing alongside wheat.Some are used in new alternatives to plastics and other materials, but others will simply be burned. Burning crops is becoming more popular because it is good for the planet.Doing so is also cheaper than burning fossil fuels.As more land is devoted to non-food crop production, the economics of crops for fuel are likely to become even more favorable. Humans have been burning such biomass--organic materials from plants or animals-- since they discovered fire.But that burning fossil fuels could have catastrophic consequences has brought biomass back into fashion. Even allowing for emissions of carbon dioxide from fuel used in planting, harvesting, processing and transporting biomass fuel, replacing fossil fuel with biomass can typically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 90 percent. Power stations around the world are experimenting with forms of biomass to add to their coal or oil, with encouraging results.Indeed, power companies could profit by turning to biomass, especially when the subsidies many governments offer for using renewable energy are taken into account. Farmers can benefit from growing biomass.In Europe, the reduction of subsidies for certain crops is exposing farmers to market forces.Instead of being paid for whatever they produce, farmers must seek a clear demand for their product.Many believe that the demand for alternatives to fossil fuels could be just such a driver. But while biomass offers a variety of potential alternatives, the world's infrastructure has developed around burning fossil fuels to such a stage that switching to biomass involves a change in conception that many companies have not accepted. Also, there are problems with using biomass.Although most coal-fired power stations could take a small amount of their fuel from biomass without significant adjustment, few are built to run on biomass alone.Burning some forms of biomass also causes environmental problems.Oils and waste can be smelly, while wood produces smoke unless burned properly. The supply chains for fossil fuels are set up well, but those for biomass are just the beginning. Sources of supply for biomass rely on farm production and can therefore be less reliable. They are necessarily limited and it wouldn't make sense to turn a very large amount of valuable agricultural land away from food crops.But as the world adjusts to the need to control greenhouse gas emissions, these problems may receive more attention.

What would be the best title for the text ?	"In Colombia , there are some unwritten rules that people are used to , These rules are not officially established , but people do respect them . For example , on a bus , a person keeps a distance from another person , and people don't like to touch each other . Many people come to work late because they prefer to wait for another bus if the first one is too crowded . They don't want to have to stand too close to another person , or maybe they are afraid of starting a conversation . A friend of mine in Colombia once said his mom got angry because he came home late , so he asked her , "" Mom , what do you think of most people arriving at their jobs so late ? "" That gave her the answer to her question since everyone knows no one wants to get on a bus that is too crowded . His mother realized at that moment that customs have a big influence on a person's life . Sometimes , people don't like to make any kind of conversation or make eye contact with others . For example , when they are in line at a bank , they prefer to look up or down rather than look at other people . Moreover , people usually look down when they are in an elevator . Not only on a bus , in line at a bank , and in an elevator do people usually avoid talking to other people , but also in the streets when they are walking , they prefer to look down and to avoid contact with others ."

Which of the following is not included in the textbooks of relevant countries?	"Few, if any, instruments shape national culture more powerfully than the materials used in schools. Textbooks are not only among the first books most people meet; in many places they are, along with religious texts, almost the only books they have. A study in South Africa showed that fewer than half of pupils had access to more than ten books at home. In 2010 a study by Egypt's government found that, apart from school textbooks, 88% of Egyptian households read no books. The degree to which a government keeps control of the textbooks used in classrooms is a good guide to its commitment to ideological control. Where that desire is strong, governments are likely to produce the textbooks themselves or define carefully what goes into them. America's State Department employs people to keep an eye on other countries' textbooks, in an effort to understand better how their people think and what their governments want them to think. Other countries probably do the same. Textbooks have long been a source of worry. After the attacks on America on September 11th 2001, some in both America and Saudi Arabia, including officials, supposed that Saudi Arabia's curriculum of intolerance was responsible, at least in part, for the emergence of al-Qaeda . Sometimes the requirements of the state are more clearly seen in what textbooks leave out. The world has long criticized Japan for the way its textbooks whitewash the country's history, in particular dressing up Japanese war crimes. The ""New History Textbook"", for example, which was submitted for government approval in 2000, played down Japan's aggression in the Sino-Japanese war of 1894-95 and the occupation of China in the 1930s and 1940s, and avoided mention of the use of sex slaves by its armies or the rape of Nanjing. In America most of the disputes about textbooks are home-grown. Liberals worry that their children are being taught a nationalistic version of history that emphasizes the wonders of industrialization and plays down slavery and the killing of Indian tribes. By contrast, Conservatives complain about inadequate education of love for their country and too much secularism . In 2010 the Texas board of education managed to remove Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence, from the state's list of important revolutionary figures, apparently because of Jefferson's insistence on the separation of church and state. He was, however, swiftly restored. As long as textbooks are issued or approved by the state, they will remain a political issue. But as access to other textbooks is enjoyed more widely, some of the dominance they now enjoy will weaken."	['Japanese war crimes in Japanese textbooks.']
According to the writer, the English class was _ ?	"Have you still remember what happened when you went to school on the first day? I still remember my interesting first day of school . On that day, I hurried to my science class in the morning and found a seat in the back. I waited there for 15 minutes before the bell rang. The science teacher told us about some class rules. No one talked to me nor did I talk to anyone else. I was one of those very shy girls. After the science class, I had an English class. I thought it would be boring but it turned out to be very funny. When the classes of the morning ended I went to lunch. I sat outside the dining room with no one to talk to and no food because I was too nervous to join the lunch line. I kept looking around hoping to see someone I knew but I never saw anyone. Lunch ended and I went to have my art class. I was the first one there and not even my teacher was there yet. So I sat at my desk and started drawing some pictures. I didn't notice the rest of the class walking in or the girl that was standing behind me till I surprised by the voice, ""So what are you drawing?"" It was a girl who had really long hair. She ended up being my best friend and one of the kindest and liveliest girls I know. In the next class meeting, the teacher asked us to talk about the past holiday. I was glad to make some new friends in the class. The first day of high school was hard for me but I got through it."	['interesting']
Which of the following is True based on the whole passage ?	"Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge's new son will be named George Alexander Louis, the royal family says. A statement from William and Catherine's settlement Kensington Palace said the baby, third in line to the throne , would be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. On Wednesday the royal couple took their son to Catherine's parents' house in Berkshire, following a half-hour visit by the Queen. All three names had been among the favourites listed by British bookmakers and the announcement was relatively quick by royal standards. It took a month for the name ofPrince Charles, the heir to the throne, to be announced, and a week for William, his eldest son. George has been the name of six British kings. The last, George VI, was the father of Queen Elizabeth II and _ from 1936 to 1952. Alexandra, the female form of Alexander, is one of the Queen's middle names and was also the name of the Queen mate of King Edward VII at the start of the last century. Louis is one of William's middle names and was the given name of Prince Charles's tutor and great-uncle Louis Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979. The choice of name, relatively short by royal standards, does not necessarily mean the baby will eventually become King George VII. The Queen's father was named Albert, but chose to be crowned as George VI. ""It's interesting that they chose to go with just three names,"" historian Suzannah Lipscomb told Sky News. ""It's almost as if the royal family is coming down with ordinary people, who tend to have fewer middle names than monarchs .It is a name that none can find any problems with. George itself can't be shortened in any obvious offensive way. They've probably gone for something that is safe."""	['George Alexander Louis was the third heir to the British throne.']
Which of the following is NOT true ?	Most American families are smaller than the families in other countries.Most American families have one or two parents and one or two children each. Children in the US will leave their parents' home when they grow up.They usually live far from their parents because they want to find good jobs.They often write to their parents or telephone them.And they often go to visit their parents on holiday. Parents usually let their children choose their own jobs.Americans think it is important for young people to decide on their lives by themselves. Parents ask children to do some work around their house.And in many families, parents pay their children for doing some housework so that hey learn how to make money for their own use.	"[""Parents don't ask their children to do the housework.""]"
Kids can have full-time jobs at the age of _ in the USA.	If you live in the United States, you can't have a full-time job until you are 16 years old. At 14 or 15, you work part-time after school or on weekends, and during summer vacation you can work 40 hours each week. Does all that mean that if you are younger than 14, you can't make your own money? Of course not! Kids from 10-13 years of age can make money by doing lots of things. Valerie, 11, told us that she made money by cleaning up other people's yards. Lena, 13, makes money by knitting dog sweaters and selling them to her neighbors. Reisa said she had started taking art classes and showing her works to people. People ask her to draw pictures for them and they pay her for them. Jasmine, 13, writes articles for different magazines! Kids can learn lots of things from making money. By working to make your own money, you are learning the skills you will need in life. These skills can include things like how to get along with others, how to use technology and how to use your time wisely. Some people think that asking for money is a lot easier than making it; however, if you can make your own money, you don't have to depend on anyone else. The five dollars that you make will probably make you feel a lot better than the twenty dollars you ask for.	['17']
According to the author, we should do the following EXCEPT _ .	Today our life and work rarely feel light or pleasant. Instead, the whole experience of being alive begins to melt into huge responsibility. It becomes the standard greeting everywhere: I am so busy. We say this to one another with no small degree of pride. The busier we are, the more important we seem to ourselves and, we imagine, to others. To be unavailable to our friends and family, to be unable to find time for the sunset, to speed through our responsibilities without time for a single mindful breath -- this has become the model of a successful life. Because we do not rest, we lose our way. We lose the nourishment that gives us help. We miss the quiet that gives us wisdom. Poisoned by the belief that good things come only through tireless effort, we never truly rest. This is not the world we dreamed of when we were young. How did we get so terribly rushed in a world filled with work and responsibility, yet somehow lack of joy and delight? We have forgotten the Sabbath . Sabbath is the time to enjoy and celebrate what is beautiful and good -- time to light candles, sing songs, tell stories, bless our children and loved ones, give thanks, share meals, nap and walk. It is time to be nourished and refreshed as we let our work, our chores and our important projects lie fallow, trusting that there are larger forces at work taking care of the world when we are at rest. Sabbath is more than the absence of work. Many of us, in our desperate drive to be successful and care for our many responsibilities, feel terribly guilty when we take time to rest. But the Sabbath has proven its wisdom over the ages. Many of us still recall when, not long ago, shops and offices were closed on Sundays. Those quiet Sunday afternoons remained in our cultural memory.	['believing that good things come only through tireless effort']
What will probably be discussed next?	Teacher's Day around the world is not celebrated on the same day. In some countries, Teacher's Day is celebrated on working days. However, in other countries, it is celebrated on holidays. Here we are giving you a list of countries that celebrate Teacher's Day on holidays. China Teacher's Day was proposed at National Central University in 1931. It was adopted by the central government of Republic of China in 1932. In 1939, the day was set on August 27, Confucius's birthday. The government of the People's Republic of China called it off in 1951. It was reestablished in 1985, and the day was changed to September 10. Now more and more people are trying to celebrate Teacher's Day back to Confucius's birthday. India In India, Teacher's Day is celebrated on September 5, in honor of Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the second President of India,because his birthday was September 5. Russia In Russia, Teacher's Day is on October 5. Before 1994, this day was set on the first Sunday of September. The USA In the United States, Teacher's Day is a holiday on the Tuesday of the first full week of May. Thailand January 16 was adopted as Teacher's Day in Thailand by a resolution of the government on November 21, 1956. The first Teacher's Day was celebrated in 1957. Iran In Iran, Teacher's Day is celebrated on May 2 every year. It is in honor of the famous Iranian professor Ayatollah Morteza Motahhari who died on May 2, 1980. Although different countries celebrate Teacher's Day on different days, the activities people take to celebrate it just stay the same.	"[""What activities people take to celebrate Teacher's Day.""]"
Why had the gentleman been doing acts of kindness?	"A few days ago,I went to school with lots of books,hoping to get a locker .Suddenly,it started raining heavily. I hurried to pay for my locker,but I was disappointed when they informed me they only accepted cash. I was $7.00 short,which meant I had to carry the books back home. It would be an exhausting twohour journey back home with all those books. An elderly gentleman nearby noticed my problem. He asked how much cash I needed. When I told him I was $7 short,he quickly took out the money from his wallet. ""You don't have to pay me back,""he said. I was speechless;I didn't know whether to take the money or come back with the books the next day. A young student who was working there noticed my hesitation. ""He's really nice,"" said the student. ""I was starving this morning and he bought breakfast for me. He always helps people in different ways."" The next day,I went to him and thanked him for trusting me and lending me the money. He said he forgot about it and didn't expect I would give it back. ""I'm very happy,""he said,""not because I'm getting my money back,but because this is the right way to go--whatever you get from this world,give it back as much as you possibly can. Spread kindness around the world with the smallest things you can do."" Later,I found out he wasn't involved with any charity organizations. He has been performing these types of acts for years.

How did Alexis help Sue soon after she ran out of the car?	"Alexi s Vaughan,17,sat tiredly in the passenger seat of her dad's car.The early Saturday morning run with her father,Michael,was part of the punishment.She stared sadly out of the window at the cornfields. An experienced hunter,Alexis let her eyes lazily search for wildlife.She was shocked when a deer came into view about 200 yards in front of them.Mule deer never appeared in plain sight ten days before hunting season.It was a buck--a male deer with sharp,three-pronged antlers . Suddenly Alexis heard a scream and saw an arm fly up near the deer's head.She realized the buck was attacking a woman.Sue Panter had been Out for her morning run.The deer had appeared from the tall corn and begun following her.Having lived in the countryside of Idaho for years,Sue knew that most deer got frightened by humans.But this deer moved closer,even when she threw a handful of small stones at it. ""I knew I was in trouble,""she says. The buck rushed forward,lifted her up with its antlers and threw her into the air. Sue could feel the antlers made small holes in her leg and blood ran down her leg. When the Vaughans pulled up,the buck was throwing Sue like a rag doll. Before her father had stopped the car,Alexis rushed out of the car and down the slope toward the buck.""1 was kicking and hitting it hard with my fists to get its attention so that It will leave the woman,""she says.However,the animal was not frightened at all.Then Michael pushed the buck away from the woman by the antlers. Alexis helped Sue up the slope and into the Vaughans'car.Then she tied a tourniquet to Sue's right leg.Her neck was cut.Then she heard her father shout loudly. Michael had been knocked to the ground,his right leg seriously cut by the buck. Alexis took a hammer from the car and ran to where Michael lay on his back in the dirt.She beat the buck's head and neck,but the blows didn't frighten it away.""I was losing faith,""she says. ""A couple more strikes,Alexis,""said Michael.""You can do it.""Alexis closed her eyes and hit with all her strength at the deer's neck with the hammer. When she opened her eyes, the deer was running away. A1exis got in the driver's seat and sped toward the hospital in Franklin,hearing her dad's breathing grow difficuIt and unsmooth as the blood from his wounded leg had flowed through the T--shirt he'd wrapped around it.In the backseat,Sue looked unconscious. After doctors treated Sue and Michael,Sue tearfully thanked her rescuers."" _"	"[""By trying to draw the buck's attention away from Sue.""]"
This passage is probably taken from _ .	"The Girl From the Street The workers who brought the girl to the orphanage knew little about her. The streets where they found her had been her home for many years. Her parents were unknown. They left her long ago. At the orphanage, the girl, like all the children there, was taught to read and write. While she was studying at the orphanage, she learned something else--to be independent . At twenty-one, she left the orphanage and began working as a secretary. And then, in 1975, while she was still working as an ordinary secretary, something special happened. She entered the Miss Hong Kong competition and won it. This was the turning point in her life. Now her name, Mary Cheung, was known to everybody. Mary entered the competition because she wanted to show that orphanage girls could be something. Winning the competition gave her the chance to start a new life. This led her first into television and then into business as a manager. When she was working as a manager, she had trouble with her reports. ""My English just wasn't good enough."" She says. Luckily, she had a boyfriend (who later became her husband) to help her. Mary studied management at Hong Kong and graduated in 1980, She started her own business in 1985. But she did not stop developing herself. She then studied at the University of Hong Kong. Since 1987, she had spent a lot of time on photography. She has held several exhibitions of her work in many places---China, New Zealand and Paris. She still found time, however, to work on TV, write for newspapers and bring up her family. The girl from the street has come a long way, but her journey is not finished yet."	['a newspaper']
What do the five interlocking rings symbolize? _ .	The original Olympics took place nearly 3000 years ago in the year 776 BC. Many different sports were played, including boxing, running, throwing the discuss , though there were fewer sports involved than those in the modern Olympics. The Games were held every five years until they were forbidden by the Romans in AD 393. The first new Olympics were held in 1896 in Greece. From 1900, the Games were held every four years, only three Olympics were wiped out because of wars---1916, 1940 and 1944. Nowadays, different countries hold the Games in turns. The country which holds the Games provides vast facilities, including a stadium , swimming pools and accommodation , but competing countries pay their own players' expense. The Olympics start with the arrival in the stadium of a torch , lighted on Mount Olympus by the sun's rays. The well-known Olympic flag, however, is a modern conception : the five interlocking rings symbolize the uniting of all five continents that take part in the Games.	['Five continents']

He has to get up early in the morning. After a quick breakfast, he has to run to school and get there on time. His father hopes to borrow some money to buy a bike for him, but he knows his mother is always ill and his father spends much money on medicine. He doesn't agree with him and keeps running there every day. Now he's very strong and never late for class and his teachers often praise him. Last week there was a sports meeting in his school.

Which of the following organizations helps students who don't have enough services?	The Airport Art Program is proud to have three Youth Art Galleries at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Georgia students, from kindergarten to twelfth grade, are given the chances to have their artwork exhibited to an ever-changing audience in the millions. In return these talented youths provide new artwork every three months to enrich the airport. The first gallery opened in the summer of 1997. In December of 1998 a second gallery opened. Both of these galleries are organized by the Airport Art Program and Georgia Art Education Association(GAEA). The GAEA aims to improve the conditions of teaching art across Georgia. They organize meetings for art students to improve their skills and provide exhibition chances for them to show their artwork. They also hold meetings twice a year for teachers. The third Youth Art Gallery is organized by the Airport Art Program and the Youth Art Connection(YAC)of Atlanta. YAC is a part of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Atlanta. YAC uses the arts as a way to connect with children and teens who don't get enough help or services. They also work with the community to provide cultural enrichment programs for young people.

According to the study, older people predicted their life satisfaction more accurately because _ .	"Older people who have low expectations for a satisfying future may be more likely to live longer, healthier lives than those who see brighter days ahead, according to new research ""Our findings showed that being overly optimistic in predicting a better future was associated with a greater risk of disability and death within the following decade,"" said Frieder R. Lang, the leading researcher of the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany."" Pessimism about the future may encourage people to live more carefully, taking health and safety measures."" Lang and colleagues examined data collected from 1993 to 2003 for the national German Socio-Economic Panel, an annual survey on approximately 40,000 people from 18 to 96 years old. The researchers divided the data according to age groups: 18 to 39 years old, 40 to 64 years old and 65 years old and above. Through mostly in-person interviews, the participants were asked to rate how satisfied they were with their lives and how satisfied they thought they would be in five years. Five years after the first interview, 43 percent of the oldest group had underestimated their future life satisfaction, 25 percent had predicted accurately and 32 percent had overestimated , according to the study. The researchers calculated that each increase in overestimating future life satisfaction was related to a 9.5 -percent increase in reporting disabilities and a 10- percent increase in risk of death. Because a darker outlook on the future is often more realistic, older adults' predictions of their future satisfaction may be more accurate, according to the study. In contrast, the youngest group had the sunniest outlook. ""We argue, though, that the analysis may depend on age and available resources. These findings shed new light on how our perspectives can either help us take action or prevent us from taking action that can help improve our chances of a long, healthy life,"" Lang said."

The purpose of the writing is _ .	"Cowboys Full: The Story of Poker You may not play poker yourself but for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, the fate of the free world has been determined by men who do. So this recommendation is not for those who already play the game - if you do, you needn't bother reading the rest of this review, just go off and buy the book - as to the non-player, this is seriously worth their attention. Although it began as poque, a French game that developed in New Orleans and headed up the Mississippi steamboats, by the mid-19th century poker was the most popular American amusement; the national game, in effect. So the history of America can be viewed through the history of poker, as James McManus quietly demonstrates. In this book you watch America grow up over a card table, from the wild west games which could either leave you broke, or dead, or both to the more polite early 20th-century scenes of respectable games. And it is possible to argue, after reading this book, that history would be different if there were no such game which combined luck, intelligence, dishonesty, courage, skill and character. (There's a very good chapter which tries to work out how much luck is involved in the game.) Few over here have read or will read Shelby Foote's 2,836-page history of the American civil war, so we can be grateful that McManus provides us with a clear and elegant outline which tells how it was ""the first work of history to explore how the game's wisdom and logic fit into the whole scheme of _ "". Not only, for instance, was Ulysses S Grant a good poker player, but as a student at West Point he'd learned the betting strategies of many of his contemporaries who would go on to become rebel generals. Nixon's poker game has already been analysed by Garry Wills in his Nixon Agonistes; Oskar Morgenstern, one of Eisenhower's advisers, pointed out that chess was Russians' national game and poker was the Americans'. This is not, though, the history of poker, but, as the subtitle tells us, the story of poker, you will find fuller details elsewhere. This is a very flowing and impressionistic account, with a huge knowledge of the game; at times, in its mixing together of anecdote and observation, it produces the feeling you might get from studying a work of art. McManus is a first-rate writer: controlled, sensitive, accurate and convincing. And if the game makes no sense to you or holds no appeal, it might be the case that you are putting yourself at a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with the rest of humankind."

The study Marc Turner did is different from those of many other scientists in that _ .	"Everybody needs blood Have you ever seen buses on the street for donating blood? Medical workers on board collect blood from volunteers. The blood is then stored up and given to people who have lost a large amount of it due to accidents or diseases. Blood is one of the most important substances supporting our lives. But for now, the only way we can get more of it is through donation. And donated blood has its own problems. First of all, certain blood types are extremely rare. Type O negative blood (O-), for example, only exists in 7 percent of people, according to Sunday Times. There are fewer donors and therefore there isn't enough of this type of blood for everybody who needs it. In addition, donated blood comes from various people, which means that it has to be examined carefully for disease such as hepatitis and HIV to make sure that it's safe for transfusion. This is why scientists all over the world have been trying to make blood in labs. And now, someone finally succeeded--Marc Turner at the Scottish National BloodTransfusion Service has produced blood fit for transfusion, reported Forbes. Unlike many other scientists, who have tried to make blood substitutes by mixing up different ingredients together, Turner chose to grow blood directly from human stem cells . He developed a special technique to create a chemical environment similar to that in our bone marrow . This environment encourages stem cells to develop fully into red blood cell. According to Turner, his version of artificial blood is unlikely to contain disease viruses or produce side effects. And the best part is that what he managed to produce was type O- blood. Not only is it a rare blood type, it's also a universal type, which means it can be transfused into any patient. The new blood is scheduled for human tests in 2016. However, Turner stressed that the new study should not be taken as a signal for people to stop donating blood because it could be another 20 years before the artificial blood can be manufactured on a large scale. ""It is one thing to bake a cake and another thing to bake a cake 100 times the size,"" said Turner. ""It's not just a matter of putting in 100 times the ingredients."""

The writer found PSS Pollu when he was _ .	"I am the captain of a ship in American Marine Police Force. I have been working as a policeman on the sea for eight years. I really love the sea because of its cool winds, the fresh smell and the beautiful scenery , so I joined Marine Police Force to safeguard the sea. Several days ago, I was out on a boat with my friends. We were not on duty but our officer allowed us to use the police sailing boat. It was very relaxing to have a day off on the sea with friends. We went fishing. We were on our way back when I saw a ship with the name PSS Pollu. It was pouring oil into the sea. I was very upset about this, so I managed to call the ship and shouted, ""Stop at once and follow us back to the shore!"" But PSS Pollu tried to escape. We tried our best to follow her but the ship was too fast for us so we contacted the Police Force and asked for help. Two fast police boats were sent and soon caught up with PSS Pollu. The ship had no choice but to give in. Six policemen searched PSS Pollu and found that it was carrying illegal goods. The men on PSS Pollu were punished. I was rewarded for providing useful information while I was off duty. I felt proud and now I love my job even more."	['on holiday']
According to the writer,people should admire those _ .	Every country has its heroes. The heroes are the people the nation and especially the young people admire. If you get a list of the heroes of a nation,it will tell you the potential of that nation. Today in prefix = st1 /America,if you ask the high school students to list their heroes,their choice would probably fall into three groups. The first group of heroes would be the rock stars--the people connected with rock music. There is no doubt that such people do have talent but one wonders if one should hold up rock stars as a model. The rock stars too often are mixed with drugs and their personal life is not all that good. The rock stars are rich and wear the latest fashion styles. However,one should seek more in a hero than such things as money and good clothes. A second type of hero for the American youth is the sports star. Again you have a person who has a great ability in one area-sports. However,too often the personal life of the sports star is a bit of a disorder. Too frequently drugs and drinking are a part of life of the sports star. A third type of hero is the TV or movie star. This person may have lots of acting talent and is quite handsome. However,the personal life of too many actors is quite sad and they should not be held up as a model of young people. Today,the rock star,the athlete,and the actor all have become the models of the youth in America. Really,do you hear a young person say that his hero is a doctor,a teacher,or a scientist?These people are not rich and do not wear fashionable clothes. However,they are talented people who work hard to make the world a better place for everyone. What is really sad is that the young try to imitate their heroes. They like to wear the same clothes and follow their styles. If the heroes of today for the American young people are limited only to rock stars,athletes and actors,the future does not look too bright.	['who work for the interests of the people']
The writer indicates that the primitive clothes are made as a result of _ .	It took me more than 10 years to realize that the world has no shortage of fashion designers who have the ability to make trendy and elegant garments, but that it is badly in need of, simply, clothes designers. My own definitions would set fashion and clothing greatly apart. It is a fact that, in the shopping malls, there are plenty of beautiful garments whose unpredictability makes our life color1ful and interesting. You are almost convinced: You can buy whatever you dare to think. There is no doubt that fashion designers are usually with high qualifications. They study fashion trends, select color1s, and make sure the final production of their designs is done properly. However, as experience grew with age, my attraction to arts became ever stronger. I have a strong desire for clothing to stand as does paint to the painter, as does stone to the sculptor, as a simple and particular language of an individual creation, which draws the audience from an appreciation of the surface to deeper thoughts with the world of the soul. I believe that the most meaningful creative motives should arise through caring for other people, the great care of humanity--a concern for human feeling and spirituality. _ , but it is bigger than love, and it is unconditional. I believe the greatest works of art can touch the deepest and strongest parts of human feelings and the world of the spirit, and only these works can be the memories of history, preserving the most valuable feelings that have ever existed, and inspiring a greater awareness of ourselves. I am not satisfied if people only appreciate clothing if it merely satisfies their desire. I believe clothing could be a specific creative language for communicating ideas and thoughts, for inspiring you and shaping your behavior. Those clothes fashioned out of necessity possess a power that can continue to exist across the ages. This is what I have tried to achieve, the clothing to return to its original simplicity, the clothing to help people regain the natural sense. The true fashion today should not follow the trends. It should instead uncover the extraordinary in the ordinary, for I believe the pleasure you get from the clothing is not its price, but its spirit.	['necessity']
Why did the author's father buy so many oranges?	It was a freezing cold winter day. My father and I went to the market to buy a few oranges. When we arrived, the market was crowded with people. We looked around and stopped at the sight of a small booth . It was just a big piece of cloth on the ground with a few fresh-looking oranges. A young girl was sitting on the ground, reading next to the booth. My father cleared his throat and asked,'How much are the oranges?' The girl jumped up and asked,'Oh....what?' 'How much are the oranges?' my father repeated patiently. 'Oh......two for one yuan ,'the girl answered politely. 'They are not fully grown......a bit sour ,' she added ,when my father was examining the oranges. After a while he said, 'I don 't mind if they are sour......I'll buy thirty of them.' I looked at him, baffled . Then the girl put the oranges in a bag and gave it to him. My father paid for the oranges and we left. 'Why did you buy so many oranges?' I asked my father, 'Well, she was so truthful and even told me that her oranges are sour; besides, she really enjoys studying. And look at her book-it's so old; maybe she can use the money she earned to buy a book!' I nodded my head. Just then, I felt somebody pulling my arm; I turned and recognized it was the girl from whom we bought the oranges.' Here's......here's ......your change ......' she panted , and put the money in my hand. Before we could say something ,she had already turned a corner and was out of sight. The girl and her oranges will be in my memory forever.	['He wanted to help the young girl.']

What do we know about Robert Smithson?	Land Art, sometimes referred to as Earth Art or Earthworks, is a form of art which involves using physical landscapes to create art, taking art out of the museum and into the outside world. Modern Land Art movement really got going in the 1960s when American artists began creating Land Art on a large scale. Today, works of modern Land Art can be seen all over the world, sometimes right alongside much older pieces of Land Art created by people who lived thousands of years ago. Land Art, which is not necessarily unchangeable, can take a number of forms. For examples, in 1970 Robert Smithson created the Spiral Jetty , made of a collection of stones and mud, in the Great Salt Lake. The American artist made a large jetty in a spiral shape which sticks out into the waters of the lake. Reshaping the landscape is a common characteristic of Land Art, which can be created by moving parts around. People can also add things to the environment to create Land Art, like salt, which is added to the Spiral Jetty. It is possible to use plants. In all cases, Land Art is immovable. Land Art is designed to gradually form, change, and eventually decay . That's one of the biggest differences between Land Art and most of the art one sees in the museums. Some works of art can exist only for a few hours or days. Others are exposed to rain and wind so that they develop and decay over time, which is part of the attractiveness in the eyes of the artists.

Who will be limited to the New York Times articles?	"On March 28th, the New York Times will begin charging all but the most infrequent users to read articles online. In a letter to readers, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., the publisher of the paper, laid out the details of the paywall, which he said will go into effect immediately in Canada and on March 28th for the rest of the world. He called the move ""an important step that we hope you will see as an investment in the Times, one that will strengthen our ability to provide high-quality journalism to readers around the world and on any platform."" Sulzberger said that readers will be able to read 20 articles per month at no charge. Once they click on the 21st piece, however, they'll be presented with three payment options: $ 15 for four weeks of online and mobile application access, $ 20 for access to the site and the iPad application, or $ 35 for access to everything. People who already receive the printed paper through home delivery will enjoy free and unlimited access to the Times on all platforms. These details largely agree with earlier reports on how the paywall would work. The Times had made it clear that it did not want to imitate the total paywalls put into effect by papers such as The Times of London and Newsday, which block access to all contents unless the reader pays. The paper also signaled that it wants to stay relevant in the social media world. According to Sulzberger's announcement, people who come to the Times site from Facebook, Twitter or from blogs will be able to read those articles even if they have gone over their monthly limit. However, Sulzberger said that a limit will be placed on ""some search engines"", meaning that after readers have accessed a certain number of articles from search engines, any further articles they access from there will be added to their monthly count. It was reported that the only search engine that will be affected this way is Google, where there will be a five-article limit. This marks a clear attempt by the Times to close what could be a giant loophole , since so much online traffic is directed through Google. But it also presents a risk for the Times for the same reason. Sulzberger seems well aware of the risk. ""The challenge now is to put a price on our work without walling ourselves off from the global network,"" he said, adding that the Times must ""continue to engage with the widest possible audience."""

According to the passage, if a sportsman only thinks about winning, he will _ . .	Nowadays, people have a heated discussion on whether the pressure on international sports players kills the essence of sport --the pursuit of personal excellence. Children kick a football around for fun. When they get older and play for local school teams, they become competitive but they still enjoy playing. The individual representing his country cannot afford to think about enjoying himself; he has to think only about winning. He is responsible for the entire nation's hopes, dreams and reputation. A good example is the football Word Cup. Football is the world's most important sport. Winning the World Cup is perhaps the summit of international sporting success. Mention Argentina to someone and the chances are that he'll think of football. In a sense, winning the World Cup put Argentina on the map. Sports fans and supporters get quite _ about the World Cup. People in England felt that their country was somehow important after they won in 1966. Last year thousands of Scots sold their cars, and even their houses, and spent all their money traveling to Argentina, where the finals were played. So, am I arguing that international competition kills the idea of sport? Certainly not! Do the Argentineans really believe that because eleven of their men proved the most skillful at football, their nation is in every way better than all others? Not really, But it's nice to know that you won and that in one way at least your country is the best.	['lose enjoyment']

From this passage we know _ .	"School education is very important and useful. The students both learn knowledge and get an education. Yet, no one can learn everything from school. The scientists,such as Edison,Newton,Galileo and Einstein, didn't learn everything from school. They learned a lot of knowledge outside school or in practice by themselves. A teacher, even he knows a lot, can't teach his students everything. The teacher's job is to show his students how to learn, how to read and how to think. A good teacher with rich experience in teaching can teach his students the methods(="" ways)of"" study. Through these methods the students are able to learn and get a lot of things by themselves. Usually it is very easy for the students to remember some knowledge, but it is very difficult to use it for problems. If a teacher really shows the students the ability of how to use knowledge, it means the teacher has learned lots of knowledge by himself (or herself). The success in learning shows he or she knows how to study."	"[""a teacher can't teach the students everything""]"
"More than 250 million people call America ""home"" because ."	"Who are these people rushing by you on the street? More than 250 million people now call America"" home"" , but most of them can trace their families back to other parts of the world. If you, look at the names on shop windows, you will see that Americans come from many different lands. The idea that these people, who once were strangers to the United States,have lost the customs and cultures of their original countries and have become ""Americans""is really not true. In fact, what exists in America is - more often a kind of "" side - by - side"" living in which groups of people from other countries often have kept many of their own customs and habits. They join the general American society only in certain areas of their lives such as in schools,business,and sportsbut they keep many of their own native customs and manners socially and at home. This "" side - by - side"" living has both advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes it may cause disagreements to develop between groups whose ways of life are very different from one another. However, there are also great advantages that come from the variety of cultures brought by settlers from other lands. There is great freedom of choice among ideas ' dress, food, and social customs in America. Everyone can find some part of his or her own familiar world in the United States, in churches, music, food, national groups, or newspaper."	['they settle there now']
Form the passage we can learn that _ .	The Taj Mahal is considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings in the world and the finest example of the late style of Indian architecture . It is at Agra in northern India. It lies beside the River Jumna in the middle of gardens with quiet pools. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mogul emperor Shah Jehan, who ruled India in the 17th century. It is used to honour his favorite wife, known as Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631. The building, which was completed between 1632 and 1638, was designed by a local Muslim architect , Ustad Ahmad Lahori. The whole building, with gardens and gateway structures, was completed in 1643. The Taj Mahal stands at one end of the garden tomb with marble path. The room is softly lighted by the light that passes through double screens of carved marble set high in the walls. The building now is kept in good condition. The Taj Mahal took 22 years to build. Shah Jehan planned a similar building, but in black instead of white, to lie on the other side of the river. But before it could be built, Shah Jehan was imprisoned by his son and buried next to his wife in the Taj Mahal.	['the Taj Mahal has become a place of interest']
Nearly nobody came to the farmer's land to work ,because _	"Years ago a farmer owned land along the Atlantic seacoast. He constantly advertised for hired hands but never made it because most people were afraid of the awful storms. Finally, a short, thin man, approached the farmer. ""Are you a good farmhand?"" the farmer asked him. ""Well, I can sleep when the wind blows,"" answered the little man. Although puzzled by this answer, the farmer still hired him. The little man worked well around the farm, busy all day, and the farmer felt pleased with the man's work. Then one night the wind blew strongly. Jumping out of the bed, the farmer carried a lantern and rushed next door to the hired man's sleeping quarters. Farmer shook the little man and shouted, ""Get up! A storm is coming! Tie things down before they blow away!"" But the little man said firmly, ""No sir. I told you, I can sleep when the wind blows."" The farmer had no time to lose his temper. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his surprise, he found everything had been prepared. The cows were in the barn, the chickens were in the coops, and the doors were barred. The shutters were tightly secured. Everything was tied down. Nothing could blow away. The farmer then understood what his hired man meant. When you're prepared, spiritually, mentally and physically , you have nothing to worry about. Can you sleep when the wind blows through your life? The hired man in the story was able to sleep because he had protected the farm against the storm."	['People fear the terrible weather']
People may feel _ to hear that Japanese eat raw fish.	"People in different places eat different things. In South China people like to eat rice. Sometimes they eat it twice or three times a day. They usually eat it with fish, meat and vegetables. It tastes very delicious. Japanese like to eat rice, too. They also eat a lot of fish. Sometimes they eat raw fish.It sounds strange but smells very fresh. In western countries like Britain, Australia and the USA, the most important food is bread or potatoes. People usually make their bread at home. And they cook potatoes in different ways. In England the most popular food is fish and chips. Sometimes people eat this food at home, in their workplace, in the park or even on the street. People call it ""takeaway"" food. In China today,there are also much""takeaway""food,and most children like to eat them."	['surprised']
The text is mainly about _ .	"Telling fewer lies benefits people physically and mentally. Anita Kelly, study author and professor of psychology at the University of Notre Dame, recruited 110 adults for her study. She divided them into two groups and asked one group to stop lying for 10 weeks. Lies included big ones and tiny ones--any false statement--but participants were still allowed to leave out the truth, keep secrets and avoid questions they didn't want to answer, etc. The other group wasn't given any special instructions about lying. It turns out that both groups reduced their lying, but those who were specifically told to tell the truth improved their health more. ""We found that the participants could purposefully and dramatically reduce their everyday lies, and that in turn was associated with significantly improved health,"" said Kelly. When participants in the no-lie group told three fewer white lies than they did in other weeks, they experienced, on average, fewer mental-health complaints and physical complaints. They were less likely to feel tense or sad and also experienced fewer sore throats and headaches. They also reported that personal relationships improved. Additionally, participants found themselves being honest about their daily accomplishments, and they stopped making up excuses for being late or failing to complete a task, for example. ""It's certainly a worthy goal to have people be more honest and interact with others in a more honest way,"" says psychologist Robert Feldman. ""That would be beneficial. I'm a little doubtful that it makes us all healthier, but it may make us healthier in a psychological way."""	['the connection between honesty and health']
Parents with large families ask fewer questions at dinner because _ .	"As any homemaker who has tried to keep order at the dinner table knows, there is far more to a family meal than food. Sociologist Michael Lewis has been studying 50 families to find out just how much more. Lewis and his co-worker carried out their study by videotaping the families while they are having ordinary meals in their own homes. They found that parents with small families talk actively with each other and their children. But as the number of children gets larger,conversation gives way to the parents' efforts to control the loud noise they make. That can have an important effect on the children. ""In general the more question-asking the parents do, the higher the children's IQ scores,""Lewis says. "" And the more children there are, the less question-asking there is. "" The study also provides an explanation for why middle children often seem to have a harder time in life than their siblings . Lewis found that in families with three or four children, dinner conversation is likely to center on the oldest child, who has the most to talk about, and the youngest, who needs the most attention. "" _ ""says Lewis. When you see someone get up from the table and walk around during dinner,chances are for the middle child. ""There is, however,one thing that stops all conversation and prevents anyone from having attention: ""When the TV is on,""Lewis says, ""dinner is a non-event ""."

It can be known from the passage that Tori Kelly _ .	"Singer-songwriter Tori Kelly is close to a huge breakthrough. Her recent performances on the BET Awards shows have created a sensation in pop music. You couldn't call Kelly an overnight success. Sure she's only 22. The Southern Californian girl first appeared in public on the talent show ""Star Search"" when she was only 10. But her real appearance came from posting videos on YouTube. Eventually Kelly made her way to ""American Idol"", and advanced through to Hollywood. But she did not make the Top 24. That loss encouraged her to write more of her own material, which eventually became part of her first album ""Handmade Songs by Tori Kelly"". ""Even just releasing music in general is an achievement. I get to put out a whole album of songs that I just put my whole heart into, and people are responding really well to it,"" she said. ""It's like the best feeling in the world because these are songs about my life. So it's really cool to be able to do what I love."" ""Handmade Songs"" sold well enough to reach the top 10 in a number of music charts .She followed that success with live performances at clubs in Los Angeles. Recently, Kelly excited audiences at the Billboard Music Awards with her performance of her song ""Nobody Love"". The singer-songwriter says that being within reach of her goal is amazing. ""I think all the awards shows I have done so far have just been so _ l,"" she said. ""Like, I always dreamed of being on different awards shows, sitting at home on my sofa and watching. I think as a kid I just always put myself on that stage, and the fact that it's actually happening, that I get to be a part of these shows is unbelievable."" Kelly released her full-length album ""Unbreakable Smile"" in June, 2015. Her single ""Should've been us"" is also rising on the Billboard Hot 100."	['focuses on her career because she loves music']
From the passage we can learn that _ .	"In ancient times, there was a painter. He was good at painting flowers and birds. But he never stopped practicing until he became very famous. An emperor of China also loved paintings,especially roosters . So he asked the famous painter to paint a rooster for him. He wanted the rooster to be the best among all his collections. The painter promised to do so. The emperor waited and waited for one year.,but he didn't get the picture. He couldn't waited to see the painter. He became angry and wanted to kill him. So the painter hurried into the palace with paper,paint and a brush. In five minutes, a perfect rooster was on the paper. After seeing this,the emperor became much angrier. ""Since you can paint a rooster in five minutes, why did you keep me waiting for over a year?""he asked. ""Your Majesty ,""said the artist. ""I will let you know why.But you'll have to come with me. "" he invited the emperor to his house. There, there were piles and piles of paper. On every piece of paper was a painting of a rooster. ""Your Majesty ,""said the painter. ""It took me more than one year to improve my painting skill in order to paint a perfect rooster for you."	['hard work causes perfect result']
37. According to Mr. Bjomson, _ .	"In June, 2007, a group of students from eight high schools in Winnipeg, the capital of Canada's Manitoba province, will begin test-launching a satellite the size of a Rubik's cube. The one-kilogram Win-Cub satellite, named for its home city and its shape, will be put into low orbit. Once in space, it can perform for a few months or up to several years, communicating information that could help find the signs of earthquakes. There are 80 similar satellite projects worldwide, but this is the first high-school based program of its kind in Canada. 30 Manitoba high school students are having a hand in designing and building the satellite, in cooperation with aerospace experts and 10 students from the University of Manitoba, and with support from two other organizations. The Win-Cube project is not something that goes on a piece of paper; it is real-world engineering, allowing high school students to have an opportunity to learn more about the exciting world of engineering through their participation in this challenging program. It is also taken as a wonderful example of the unique partnerships within Manitoba. Designing, building and launching a satellite with high-school participation will bring this world-class educational project into reality and Manitoba closer to space. ""These Manitoba high school students deserve congratulations for their enthusiasm, innovation , and a strong love for discovery,"" said Education, Citizenship and Youth Minister Peter Bjomson. ""We want to make science more relevant, interesting and attractive to high school students by showing them how classroom studies can relate to practical experience in the workplace or, in this case, in space,"" Bjomson added. The Win-Cube program is mainly aimed at inspiring a strong desire for discovery on the part of the students. It also shows Manitoba's devotion to research and innovation and the development of a skilled workforce -- all important drivers of knowledge-based economic growth."

The coffee made her _ , so she still couldn't fall asleep.	"A Hard-working Student This story is about a young student. She worked very hard at her lessons. She was too busy to have a rest.

What does the author think of the Disney version?	"Walt Disney is credited for creating such wonderful things as Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. However, he cannot take the credit for creating other well-loved characters, such as Cinderella and Snow White. _ are almost automatically associated with Disney because Disney turned old fables into cartoon movies. The original Cinderella varies very much from the Disney version we know today. It started off with the girl mourning her mother's death and going to her tomb three times a day. In addition, there were only birds that helped Cinderella; there was no such thing as a fairy godmother or helpful mice, nor was there mention of a horse and carriage. The stepsisters were cruel: they always threw Cinderella's food into the ashes of the fire and made her sleep on the ashes on the floor, hence her name. In the original story, the king's ball actually lasted for three days. With the help of the birds, the girl, beautifully dressed, danced with the prince on all three nights and the prince fell in love with her. However, she broke away from him to rush back home each night. On the last night, the prince placed soothing sticky on the stairs; as Cinderella made her escape, a shoe got stuck on it. Here now is where the story becomes unpleasant: when the prince went to the house looking for the girl whose foot fit the shoe, the wicked stepmother told one of her two daughters to cut off her big toe to fit into the shoe. The daughter did as told. So the prince took her away to be his bride. But when they passed the tomb of Cinderella's mother, the birds called out to the prince, ""Turn and peep, there's blood in the shoe; the shoe is too small, the true bride waits for you."" ZXXK Realizing he had been tricked, the prince returned the daughter to her mother. The other then had to cut off part of her heel in order to fit into the shoe, with the same result. Only Cinderella's foot fit perfectly and so the prince chose to marry her. The story ends with the wedding day: as Cinderella's two stepsisters followed her, pretending to be devoted to her so that they could enjoy the king's riches, two birds flew by and plucked out their eyes. Because of their wickedness and falsehood, they had to spend the rest of their days blind. The original Cinderella is so different from the Disney version. Thank goodness Disney made such changes; it indeed was a wise move."	['Excellent.']
Some older people usually want to be called by _	"It's not polite to arrive at a dinner party more than 15 to 20 minutes late. The host or hostess usually waits for all the guests to arrive before serving the meal. If someone is late, the food may be spooked , and so might the host of hostess's spirit. If you will have to be late, call and tell them to start without you. It's even worse to be early !the host or hostess will probably not be ready. If you are early, drive or walk around the block a few minutes, or just sit in your car until the right time. Though it's often important to arrive at a party on time, yet on the other hand, for open houses, he host or hostess invites guests to arrive and leave between certain times, so you can arrive at any time within the times he or she gives you. It's nice to bring an empty stomach, but it's even nicer to bring a small present. The present should not cost a lot, or you might embarrass the host or hostess. Flowers, wine, or a box of candy will do fine. Never bring more as a present. In an introduction, the order of a name is (1)the given name, (2)the family name. In other words, the given name comes first. It's important not only to learn and remember names, but to repeat them often in conversation. After the introduction, we usually call friends by their given names. Older people may want you to call them by their titles and family names, such as ""Mr.Jones"", ""Mr.Smith"",""Ms.Johson"",or ""Dr.Brown"". A maiden name is a woman's family name at birth. In the United States and Canada, after a woman marries, she takes the family name of her husband in place of her maiden name. It is now becoming common, however, for women to keep their maiden names after they get married."	['their titles and their family names']
Which one is the best title of the passage?	"The Hunan Satellite TV (HNTV) show ""Where are we going, Dad?"" is a big hit. Many famous stars brought their children to a strange village alone, and they had to spend 72 hours with their children there. The program fully showed us a modern version of the ""how to be a good father"". As the young parents today are too busy to take care of their children, this new form of""Lost on the way""played by nanny daddy and cute kids triggered a lot of people's emotional resonance . Both the kids and their parents will find that their hearts are being drawn closer. But this kind of feeling has just proved that there is a big spiritual barrier between the modern parents and children. The TV shows like ""Children are hard to support!"", ""Where are we going, Dad?"", ""hot mom"" and ""cute kids"" are becoming more and more popular. All of these show the new parents' confusion in children's education and the appeal for the balance between career and family. In real life, on the one hand, the young parents feel helpless because they are too busy to accompany their children under the pressures of work and life; on the other hand, they continue to do so. The data collected by HNTV show that nearly two-thirds of their audience are female, among whom 36% are aged from 25 to 34. We can imagine such a scene that one evening a young mother is watching the show with her young children, while her husband is still at work or trapped in socializing, or maybe is just playing computer games in the bedroom. The story of a child without the company of father is still going on. In fact, it is sometimes the same to mothers. In a modern family, it is often the old who take the responsibility for raising a child. The participation of mother in the children's education is also very low. It is just this kind of confusion where the parents have gone in the modern family education, and where the parents will guide their children to go that ""Where are we going, Dad?"" shows us. If a child wants to grow up healthily and safely into a modern citizen with independent personality and free spirit, it is very important for him or her to follow the parents who serve as their first teacher. Maybe this is the real reason why such kind of TV programs could get hot. The truth is that children will go where their parents go, and society will go where the children go."	"['Confusion behind ""Where are we going, dad?""']"
About 100 years ago, the ave rage life span was _ .	"How old is ""old""? The answer has changed over the years.Two hundred years ago, you were old at 35.At the beginning of the 20th century, the average life span was 45.In 1950,70-year-olds were really old.Today, a healthy 70-year-old person is still thought young. So, how old is old? The answer is one you've heard many times, from all kinds of people.""You are as old(or young) as you feel."" Your age simply tells you how many years you have lived.Your body tells you how well you've lived. ""Nobody grows old by living a number of years,"" wrote a writer.""People grow old when they don't have their ideals ."" People should not have the wrong ideals about aging.Sometimes, old minds can be as bright as young minds.Alice Brophy once said, ""It makes me happy who people say.You look young for your age."" What does that mean? You know you can die old at 30 (30) and live young at 80."	['80']

According to the survey, _	"Chinese high school students have the longest study hours compared to their peers in Japan , the US and South Korea. A survey conducted by the four countries said. The survey, released by the China Youth and Children Research Center on Monday, was jointly conducted with instructions in the four countries in September-October of 2008. It covers nearly 4,000 students in senior schools and vocational high schools in the four countries. About 78.3 percent of Chinese students said they spend more than eight hours at school and 56.7 percent said they study at least two more hours each day at home .by contrast, only 24.7 percent of their peers in the US , 20.5percent in Japan and 15.4 in Korea study more than two hour s after school. Around 60 percent of all students surveyed said their burden for studies was the heaviest. However the Japanese felt their burden was the worst with respondents reaching 79.2 percent Among the five biggest headaches for young people in the four countries were: 0ver-sheduling ranked first, followed by a boring leisure life, unsatisfied appearance, little time for exercise and making friends, and no spare money ""Moderate study pressure can better drive students to develop, however, too much will press their development space, and can even cause harm to their physical and psychological health"" the survey said ""Balancing their studies and all round development is a very important task"" it said."

Wombats and the Tasmanian devil are the names of_.	The Australian continent is a land like no other. Its animals, plants and landscapes have evolved over one thousand years, and there are about a million different natural species in Australia. More than 80 per cent of the country's plants and animals are unique to prefix = st1 /Australia, along with most of the fish and almost half the birds. Australia has more than 140 species of marsupials ,including koalas, wombats and the Tasmanian devil, now found only in the Australian wilderness. More than 750 species of birds have been recorded in Australia, 350 of which are found nowhere else in the world. Among them are the kookaburra, the rainbow lorikeet and fairy penguins. There are also 55 differernt species of macropods--the kangaroo family--native toAustralia. They vary greatly in size and weight, ranging from half a kilogram to 90 kilograms. The country has been making every effort to protect its natural heritage. Despite the large size of the continent, the majority of Australians live on the coast and in major cities--around 75 per cent of Australia's population lives in city areas. Australia is the driest continent on earth. Its center has one of the lowest rainfalls in the world and about three-quarters of the land is dry. These dry areas extend from the large central deserts to the western coast. Soils in these areas are very poor compared to other deserts. This has given Australians a great challenge.They have to make the best use of the variety of regions to meet the competing demands of agriculture, economy and conservation.	['animals']
What can be learnt from the passage?	There are plenty of beauty schools throughout the country that can help you to start a career in cosmetology . Nowadays, young people may not be able to afford a four-year college. Students can look forward to attending a beauty school program which will only take a few months to complete and start their career right away to earn money. There can be many benefits of going to beauty school. The expense is much less than attending a four-year university. Besides, attending beauty school is mostly a hands-on experience which appeals to many people. Some students don't like sitting all day listening to lectures and then having to study at night. What's more, most beauty school programs keep up with the changing trends and fashion. So you will always be working on different hair types which can be fun and will give you a lot of experience throughout the years of your career. If you are worried about finding a job after graduation, many beauty schools will offer assistance for immediate job placement and give you peace of mind that you will not be _ looking for a job. Most colleges and universities are not equipped to do that because of the large number of graduates each year. Cosmetologists will also make a good salary. The average salary will depend on your location, but you may earn a salary around $3,000 -- $3,500 a month. This is not including tips which could be $600 or more a month. Not only can young people go to cosmetology school, but people of all ages can start this career. As you can see, there are many benefits of beauty schools that can be the perfect opportunity for anyone to become a great cosmetologist.	['A cosmetologist gets paid at least $3,600 a month.']
What is the author's attitude towards the house parent's pinning some butterflies on the cardboard?	There was a time in my life when beauty meant something special to me. I guess that would have been when I was about six or seven years old, just several weeks or maybe a month before the orphanage turned me into an old man. I would get up every morning at the orphanage, make my bed just like the little soldier that I had become and then I would get into one of the two straight lines and march to breakfast with the other twenty or thirty boys who also lived in my dormitory. After breakfast one Saturday morning I returned to the dormitory and saw the house parent chasing the beautiful monarch butterflies who lived by the hundreds in the bushes scattered around the orphanage. I carefully watched as he caught these beautiful creatures, one after another, and then took them from the net and then stuck straight pins through their head and wings, pinning them onto a heavy cardboard sheet. How cruel it was to kill something of such beauty. I had walked many times out into the bushes, all by myself, just so the butterflies could land on my head, face and hands so I could look at them up close. When the telephone rang the house parent laid the large cardboard paper down on the back cement step and went inside to answer the phone. I walked up to the cardboard and looked at the one butterfly who he had just pinned to the large paper. It was still moving about so I reached down and touched it on the wing causing one of the pins to fall out. It started flying around and around trying to get away but it was still pinned by the one wing with the other straight pin. Finally its wing broke off and the butterfly fell to the ground and just trembled. I picked up the torn wing and the butterfly and I spat on its wing and tried to get it to stick back on so it could fly away and be free before the house parent came back. But it would not stay on him.	['disgusted']
The passage is probably written for _ .	Lakes, ponds, and beaches mean summer fun and cool relaxation from hot weather. But water also can be dangerous for kids if you don't take great care. Nearly 1,000 kids die each year by drowning. Here are some tips to keep your kids safe in the water: At the Lake or Pond *Don't let little kids swim alone without adult supervision-- lakes or ponds may be shallow near the bank and are suddenly deep sharply further out from shore. *Ponds and lakes may hide jagged rocks, broken glass, or rubbish. *Make sure kids wear foot protection; even in the water, they should wear socks or water shoes. *Watch out for weeds and grass in the water that could trap a leg or arm. *Most boating accidents, particularly among teenagers, are related to alcohol . Be sure teens know about the dangers of alcohol, on and off the water. At the Beach *Teach kids to always swim when and where a lifeguard is on duty. Unlike the calm waters of a swimming pool, the beach has special dangers like currents and tides . Check with the lifeguard when you arrive to find out about the water conditions. *Tell kids never to stand with their back to the water because a sudden wave can easily knock a child over. *Teach kids that if they're caught in a dangerous wave, they should swim parallel to the shore or should tread water and call for a lifeguard's help. Whether at the lake or at the beach, teach your child to get out of the water during bad weather, especially lightning.	['parents with little children']
It can be inferred from the passage that .	"High in the sky, a group of birds fly past. The 5-foot-tall creatures are whooping cranes, the tallest birds in North America noted for its loud call. The wild animals appear to be following much larger birds. But those aren't birds at all. They are three-wheeled aircraft called trikes , and the pilots flying them are wearing white helmets and white gowns. That plan might sound like a stupid idea, but it's not. The pilots are from an organization called Operation Migration. They are helping the whooping cranes learn to migrate, or move from one area to another when the seasons change. The cranes are endangered. In 1941,the species had dwindled to roughly 20 birds because of hunting and habitat loss. US wildlife officials counted 149 whooping cranes in November 1995,the most since the American government began taking censuses in the 1930s.Today,about 380 remain. In the fall, whooping cranes are supposed to migrate south. However, many of them don't know how. ""With so few birds left, young whooping cranes typically don't have parents around to teach them,"" explains pilot Joe Duff. That's where the trikes come in. Each October, pilots dress up as whooping cranes and take to the skies in Wisconsin. The young birds follow them because they think the trikes are big whooping cranes. It takes about three months to reach south--with plenty of rest stops on the way. The pilots lead the cranes to refuges, or protected areas, in Florida. This spring, the birds will migrate north by themselves--no trikes needed! ""It's nice because you know the birds are going to make it,"" Duff told WR News."

Alan's mother's worries were _ .	"Alan Tong was the worst driver in town. He had an accident of some kind almost every week. Alan lived with his mother. His mother was always worried about him. Every day she worried that police would turn up to arrest him. This wasn't a foolish worry because they usually called on the Tong household about once a week to deliver a speeding ticket or to serve him notice to appear in court. Most of his accidents were caused by his carelessness. He drove through red lights. He turned right without signaling. He drove at night without proper lights. He overtook other cars on hills and sharp curve. In short there wasn't a traffic regulation Alan had not broken, and he had had so many accidents that it was a miracle he was still alive. But luckily for Alan, he had never hurt anyone in his accidents or even gone to the hospital. Although Alan wasn't popular with the police, he was very popular with his lawyer. Alan's lawyer, Mr.Tsui, had earned a lot of money from Alan's cases and always rubbed his hands expectantly when he saw Alan coming into his office. One day Alan was working in the garage spraying painting his car when his mother walked in. ""What are you doing?"" his mother asked. ""Painting my car,"" Alan replied. ""I can see that,"" his mother said, ""but why are you painting one side of the car red and the other side blue?"" ""Because every time I have to go to court for a traffic offense, there are always two witnesses . ""What color1 was the car?"" the prosecutor always asks, and the two witnesses always give the same answer. Well, in the future, one witness will say it was blue. Mr. Tsui will then say to the judge, ""Your honor, the witnesses cannot even agree on the color1 of the car involved in the accident."" And the judge will have to dismiss the case against me."

We learn from the passage that the author is NOW _ .	My life as a 'runner' began by running in a playground near my home in order to lose weight about 2 years ago. As time went by, I found myself so good at running that sometimes, I even forgot how many rounds I ran around the playground. Thanks to all this practice, I was able to win the 5thplace in short course marathon game at 'BASF Yeosu Site Athletic Competition' held in October 2002. This event inspired me to take part in public short-course marathon games such as 10km, 20km and half-course competitions. Finally, in May 2003, I was able to complete a full course marathon for the first time of my life. My next challenge was the Boston Marathon race, which is the world's oldest and most famous marathon races. To qualify for the Boston Marathon, one should meet the designated time standard of their age group at a certified marathon. So I took part in ChunCheon Marathon in Korea. I had to finish the full coursewithin 3 hours and 30 minutes to meet the time standard for my age group (45 to 49 years old). But to my pleasant surprise, I recorded 3 hours 22 minutes, which is 25 minute faster than my previous best record! In April 2004, I was finally able to go to Boston. I was very pleased and proud because I could play a role to promote BASF all across the world through this sport. And it really happened! When I ran in the Boston Marathon wearing BASF logo , people along the streets rooted for me shouting 'BASF! BASF!'. I was very touched and so proud of my company. Of course I completed the full course successfully. After the game, I was interviewed by Korean local newspapers and had an opportunity to appear on several TV shows, which helped me to promote BASF in the community.	['in his fifties']
According to the passage, which of the following about Jesse Owens is true?	Jesse Owens is recognized as a hero not just because he is fast. Some people might say that they know him for just that reason. However, there are lots of fast people who are not known. Jesse Owens is known because Chancellor Adolf Hitler did not shake the hand of Jesse Owens or even recognize his feat of winning four gold medals, because Owens was an African American. Jesse Owens owed much of his success to his coach Charles Riley, who probably was the most important one making him have the career that he did. Owens came from a background that required him to work after school in a shoe shop. He couldn't attend the regularly scheduled track practices organized by his school. However, Charles Riley saw the boy had both a passion and a talent for running, and so arranged for him to be able to practice before school instead. Jesse Owens achieved this success despite his racial background, which at the time was a huge limitation to him. He could only eat in certain restaurants and sleep in certain hotels, as could all African Americans of the time. He was also never offered a scholarship for school despite setting records for NCAA championships. The Berlin Olympics in 1936 is where his star rose as high as it would ever be able to. These Olympics were during the height of Hitler's rule. It took courage to race in front of Hitler and many other racist . It took time, determination, and perseverance to race like him. He won four gold medals at those Olympics. It would take almost fifty years for someone else to walk away from the Olympics with four gold medals. He passed away at the age of 66 from lung cancer.

What's the best title of the article?	"There is one word you must learn before you visit the USA. That is ""Freeze"". Remember it has a special meaning besides the usual one. It means ""stand still and don't move"". Often policemen use it when they are ready to use their guns. If one doesn't obey the order and moves, he or she will be shot to death. One evening in Los Angeles, someone rang the bell of a house. It was a dangerous area at night, so the _ of the house took his gun with him when he answered the door. He opened the door and saw a strange man. But the man turned round and started walking away from the house. The owner cried: ""Freeze"", but the young man went on walking without obeying the owner's order. The owner thought he was trying to run away, so he shot at the young man and he was killed. Later, police found that the dead man was a Japanese student who was studying in Los Angeles University. He went to visit a friend, but unluckily could not remember the number of the house. When he realized he went to the wrong house he turned round and left. He didn't know much English and so didn't understand the word ""Freeze"". What a lesson we should get for this!"	['Freeze']
Which of the following is true according to the text?	"Inventor, physicist, surveyor, astronomer, biologist, artist... Robert Hooke was all there and more. Some say he was the greatest experimental scientist of the 17th century. In the course of his work, he cooperated with famous men of science like Isaac Newton, and the great architect, Christopher Wren. Hooke's early education began at home, under the guidance of his father. He entered Westminster School at the age of 13, and from there went to Oxford, where he came in contact with some of the best scientists in England. Hooke impressed them with his skills at designing experiments and inventing instruments. In 1662, at he age of 28, he was named Curator of Experiments at the newly formed Royal Society of London- meaning that he was responsible for demonstrating new experiments at the society's weekly meeting. Hooke accepted the job, even though he knew that the society had no money to pay him! Watching living things through a microscope was one of his favourite pastimes . He invented a compound microscope for this purpose. One day while observing a cork under a microscope, he saw honeycomb-like structures. There were cells -the smallest units of life. In fact, it was Hooke who invented the term ""cell"" as the boxlike cells of the cork reminded him of the cells of a monastery . Another achievement of Hooke's was his book Micrographia, which introduced the enormous potential of the microscope. It contains fascinating drawings of the thing he saw under the microscope. The book also includes, among other things, ideas on gravity, light and combustion that may have helped scientists like Newton when they were developing their own theories on these phenomena . Hooke made valuable contributions to astronomy too. A crater on the moon is named after him in honour of his services to this branch of science."

Lv, the groom, called the local radio because he wanted _ .	"Most Chinese people expect to relax and enjoy themselves during the Golden Week. But for those trying to go someplace,it may seem more disappointment than pleasure. This year, the severe traffic jam resulted in a roadside wedding. The suffering of being stuck in traffic was possibly most strongly felt by Lv Kangzhou and his bride Yan Mengxia. By tradition, the groom drove early in the morning to the bride's home in Zhejiang province in East China to pick her up along with her family and take them to his family's hometown for the wedding. By 4 p.m., Lv's wedding was 90 minutes away, but his car had not moved an inch for a long time. Lv contacted the local radio to explain his difficult situation and ask for a traffic forecast. The radio host told Lv there was no way he could hold his wedding on time and offered to hold their wedding on the air. At 5:30 p.m., Lv and his bride said their vows on the side of the road while Lv's family and friends witnessed the ceremony while listening to the radio. Lv wasn't the only person stuck in the Golden Week crowds. According to the state news agency Xinhua, 11.7 million people traveled by train Wednesday. It calculated that 120,000 people gathered at Tiananmen Square in Beijing to watch the flag raising ceremony. Last year, the Forbidden City in Beijing hosted 175,000 tourists on a single day during Golden Week, and the number is expecting to be even bigger this year.

"The best title for this passage should be "" _ ""."	A strong earthquake struck the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan on Saturday, killing more than 30 people and injuring hundreds of others, local authorities said on April 20th 2013. The quake struck Ya'an just after 8 a.m. local time about 115 kilometers (70 miles) away from the provincial capital, Chengdu, at a depth of around 12 kilometers, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There was conflicting information about the earthquake's strength, with the USGS putting the magnitude at 6.6 and the China Earthquake Networks Center gauging it at 7.0. Earthquakes happen without warning. They can happen any time of a day, at any point during the year. When an earthquake is happening, you should know what you should do or not do. Do NOT go outside. You could get injured from falling glass or parts of buildings. If you are outside, stay away from buildings and power lines. Stay under a desk, table, or other strong furniture. Hold on to it. Or stay in a corner of the building. Cover your face and head with your arms and cover your mouth with a towel or clothing. Stay inside until shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Keep away from pictures or advertisements on the wall or the building, and anything else that could fall and hurt you. Most people get injured by falling things during an earthquake, not by the shaking itself. Also keep away from a fire. You could fall down and burn yourself on the fire. If you are driving when an earthquake happens, stop the car if it's safe. Stay inside your car until the earthquake stops, and don't drive near bridges. Try not to stop by power lines or trees. These could fall and hurt you.	['What We Should Do in Earthquakes.']

In what manner does Lippl talk about the way of losing weight by spending holidays on mountains?	"Looking for a new weight loss plan? Try living on top of a mountain. Mountain air contains less oxygen than air at lower altitudes, so breathing it causes the heart to beat faster and the body to burn more energy. A handful of studies have found that athletes training at high altitudes tend to lose weight. Doctor Florian Lippl of the University Hospital Of Ludwig-Maximilians-university Munich wondered how the mountain air would affect overweight individuals if they weren't doing any more physical activity than usual. Lippl and his colleagues invited 20 overweight men to an environmental research station about 300 meters below the summit of Zugspitze, a mountain around 2,970 meters near the Austrian border. They were allowed to eat as much as they liked. The men also gave blood so that researchers could test for hormones linked to appetite and fatness. At the end of the week, the men, whose mean weight starting out was 105kg, had lost on average about l.5kg. The men's blood pressure also dropped, which the researchers believed was due to weight lost. Exactly what caused the weight loss is uncertain. Loss of appetite is common at higher altitudes, and indeed the men ate significantly less than usual--about 700 calories fewer per day. Lippl also notes that because their consumption was being recorded, they may have been more self-conscious about what they ate. Regardless, eating less accounts for just l kg of the l.5 kg lost, says Lippl. He thinks the increased metabolic rate, which was measured, also contributed to weight loss but cannot separate the different effects with the given data. Appetite loss at high altitudes could certainly be key, notes Damian Bailey, a physiologist at the University of Glamorgan, UK, who recently lost 11 kg during a 3-month expedition to the Andes in Chile. Unfortunately, for the average person there is no treatment that can resemble living at high altitude, says Lippl. The only alternative is hypobaric chamber, which exposes subjects to low oxygen and isn't practical as a treatment. He says, half- jokingly, ""If fat people plan their holidays, they might not go to the sea, but maybe to the mountain."""	['casual']
Hemingway was turned down for army service in World war I because _ .	Ernest Hemingway was born in Oak Park, Illinois, on July 21st, 1899. Influenced by his father, he enjoyed camping, fishing and hunting at his early age. In 1917, after graduation from high school, Hemingway began his writing career with The Kansas City Star. And then, after being rejected for army service in World War I because of poor vision, he volunteered to serve as a driver for an American ambulance unit in France. In 1918, he transferred to duty on the Italian front, where he was seriously wounded in an explosion. After his recovery, he returned home. He worked for The Toronto star, covered the Greco-Turkish war as a foreign reporter, and then returned to Paris, which was a city full of intellectual life, creativity, and genius after the war. In Paris, where he accomplished a revolution in literary style and language, his first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems, appeared in 1923, and was followed by a short story collection In Our Time, which marked his entry to American literature in 1925. Hemingway's status as a remarkable writer of his time was confirmed with the publication of A Farewell to Arms in 1929. The novel represented a farewell both for war and for love. In 1937, he became a foreign reporter covering the Spanish Civil war. Three years later, he published For Whom the Bell Tolls. Set in Spain during the Civil war, the novel restated his view of love found and lost and described the tough spirit of the common people. In 1912, the same judgment was reflected in his portrait of fisherman, Santiago, with an _ spirit in defeat, in The Old Man and the Sea, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. With one of the most important influences on the development of the American short story and novel, Hemingway has seized the imagination of the American public like no other twentieth-century author. He died by suicide, in Ketchum, Idaho, in 1961.	['he had bad eyesight']
Why does the author put forward the exam situation?	Thoughts claim our attention continuously, and waste our time and energy on unimportant and useless matters. They actually rule our life. We have become so used to this slavery, that we take it for granted, and have become unconscious of this habit, except on certain occasions. While breathing, we do not need to pay attention to each inhalation and exhalation. We become conscious of the process of breathing only when we have some difficulty with breathing, such as when our nose is blocked, due to a cold, or when we are in an unventilated room. It is the same with thinking. We become conscious of the constant onslaught of our thoughts, and of our inability to calm them down, only when we need to concentrate, solve a problem or study. We are also aware of them when we have worries or fears. Look at the following familiar situation. You need to study something for an exam. You sit comfortably on the sofa with the book in your hands and start reading. After a while you feel hungry and go to the kitchen to eat something. You return to read, and then hear your people talking outside. You listen to them for several moments and then bring your attention back to the book. After a while you feel restless and switch on the radio to listen to some music. You continue to read for a little while, and then remember something that happened yesterday, and you start thinking about it. When you look at your watch, you are amazed to find out that one complete hour has passed and you have hardly read anything. And at this time, you feel you're thinking. This is what happens when one lacks concentration. Imagine what you could have accomplished if you could control your attention and focus your mind!	['To explain the course of thinking awareness.']
Why did Jane shout loudly in the restaurant?	"I believe children have a very pure sense of humor. Well, I would like to share my experiences with you. The other day when I was out with a friend and her daughter Jane at a restaurant, Jane ordered an apple dessert, which was the most attractive dish in that restaurant. However, when she had a bite of the pie, she shouted loudly, ""Mom, why does it look good but tastes like rubber?"" My friend was uneasy. Then the waiter gave us another dish. A child can say funny things. I was at a friend's home for tea and her son, Mark, wanted her to get up. His mom replied, ""I can't, because my foot has fallen asleep now.""

The other day we were having an interesting conversation over lunch and my friend, an animal activist , was arguing with another group member. Her son Tommy suddenly stood up, ""Mom, people should never be allowed to shoot extinct animals!"" That was funny and the child did manage to turn the argument into a pleasant conversation.

What is the disadvantage of small screens in GPS equipment according to the text?	"Global Positioning Systems(GPS) are now a part of everyday driving in many countries. These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two. We spoke to Mr. Brown by Skype . He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. BARRY BROWN: ""And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'."" Mr Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. BARRY BROWN: ""One problem with a lot of the GPS units is that they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn. Because they just give you the next turn, sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place."" Barry Brown formerly served as a professor with the University of California, San Diego. While there, he worked on a project with Eric Laurier from the University of Edinburgh. The two men studied the effects of GPS devices on driving by placing cameras in people's cars. They wrote a paper based on their research. It is called ""The Normal, Natural Troubles of Driving with GPS."" It lists several areas where GPS systems can cause confusion for drivers.

As is mentioned above, which factor mainly results in students' myopia in South East Asia?	"Up to 90% of school leavers in major Asian cities are suffering from myopia ---short-sightedness, a study suggests. Researchers say the ""extraordinary rise"" in the problem is being caused by students working very hard in school and missing out on outdoor light. Eye experts say that you are short-sighted if your vision is blurred beyond 2m. It is often caused by an elongation of the eyeball that happens when people are young. According to the research, the problem is being caused by a combination of factors - a commitment to education and lack of outdoor light. Professor Morgan who led this study argues that many children in South East Asia spend long hours studying at school and doing their homework. This in itself puts pressure on the eyes, but exposure to between two and three hours of daylight helps maintain healthy eyes. Cultural factors also seem to play a part. Across many parts of South East Asia, children often have a lunchtime nap. According to Professor Morgan they are missing out on natural light to prevent short-sightedness. A big concern is the numbers of the students suffering from ""high"" myopia. One in five of these students could experience severe visual impairment and even blindness. These people are at considerable risk--sometimes people are not told about it and are just given more powerful glasses--they need to be warned about the risk and given some self-testing measures so they can get to an ophthalmologist and get some help. For decades, researchers believed there was a strong genetic component to the condition. But this study strongly suggests an alternative view. ""Any type of simple genetic explanation just doesn't fit with that speed of change; gene pools just don't change in two generations. Whether it's a purely environmental effect or an environmental effect playing a sensitive genome, it really doesn't matter, the thing that's changed is not the gene pool---it's the environment."""

Which of the following statements is TRUE about Mr. Negroponte's cheap computers?	When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them. I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia. The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed. These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term. Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them. In this way we will be able to achieve two important goals at the same time. We will reduce the waste we produce and help others. In other words, we will be able to 'kill two birds with one stone', and that is always a good thing.	['His computers will help children in developing countries to have better education.']
It is possible that ceramics are materials of _ .	Pottery is the name given to all kinds of useful or artistic objects made from clay. Pottery can be plates or water pots or baskets. Pottery can be large or small, fancy or plain. Pottery is part of the large family of ceramics .Ceramics are synthetic materials. For example, bricks and tiles are both ceramics. How is pottery made? First, a potter takes some clay. Clay is a soft, red material from the earth. It looks a little like red dirt, but it's very different. Clay is thick and rich. Wet clay can be worked into any shape. When the clay dries, it will keep that shape. The potters takes some clay and pushes and squeezes it until it is soft and smooth. After that, the clay can be shaped into anything. There are several ways to shape clay. Sometimes potters use their hands. Sometimes they use a special wheel. They place the clay in the center of a round, flat wheel. The wheel moves very fast, and the potter shapes the clay. After the potter has shaped the clay, it can be decorated . Potters use glaze, which is a kind of paint, to decorate their work. Some glazes are very simple. Other glazes have beautiful colors and designs. The glaze is not just beautiful. It is also useful. The glaze makes the pottery smooth and waterproof. Potters also make some decorative lines and designs on the surface. After it is decorated, the clay must be baked, or fired, in a special oven. Baking the clay at very high temperature makes it hard and strong. Firing also makes the glaze stick to the pottery. When the firing is over, the potter carefully removes the pottery from the oven and lets it cool slowly. If it cools too quickly, it could crack and break. Since pottery is waterproof, it is very popular for dishes. You can find examples of pottery in almost any home. But pottery can also be found in museums. Some pieces of pottery are valuable and beautiful pieces of art.	['earth']

What is the main purpose of the article?	Everyone wants to achieve true happiness in life. But the biggest factor holding most of us back is actually our ownselves. The Huffington Post released a list of seven mistakes we need to let go of in order to become happier people. Let's take a look. 1.Placing too much emphasis on fulfillment Those who put a lot of pressure on themselves to be happy feel more lonely on a daily basis than those who do not, according to research conducted at the University of Denver, US. 2. Keeping it all in Keeping it all together during tough times can hurt you. Crying is the body's emotional response to outside triggers .By _ it, you may be damaging your mental and physical health. 3. Looking at your smart phone all the time Connecting with others may be the key to happiness, but a recent University of Michigan study found that the more time participants spent on social networking sites, the less happy they felt. 4. Not moving It's no secret that a healthy lifestyle is a big part of happiness. Something as simple as a walk can help you increase your creativity and expose you to essential vitamins. 5. Not reflecting on the past In a 2013 study on nostalgia and emotion, participants reported a higher sense of physiological comfort when they looked back on the past. Affection for heartwarming memories helps people relate their past experiences to the present in order to create a greater sense of meaning. 6. Resisting change A study on the psychology of choices shows that the human brain naturally tries to avoid loss--but that resistance can cause stress. Whether it's fear of the unknown or fear of losing what you currently have, the pressure to hold on to the present can harm your future life satisfaction. 7. Not being mindful Setting aside time for meditation allows your body to relax, cultivates an attitude of gratitude and lowers your stress level, according to researchers at University of California, Los Angeles, US.

According to the passage, which of the following statements is Not true?	"Your schooldays should be some of the best and happiest days of your life. How can you gain the most from them, and ensure you do not waste this wonderful opportunity to learn? Be positive about school. Don't say things are difficult or boring. Be interested in school-life and your school subjects. Join lots of activities. Be quick to put your hand up. Go round the school with a big smile. Expect to work. School is not a holiday camp. If you are not working, you are not learning, and you are wasting your time at school. Teachers cannot make everything enjoyable. Keep fit. If you do not eat a good breakfast, you will be thinking about food in class. If you go to bed late and do not have enough sleep, you will be sleepy in class. Play some sports to keep your body strong. Do today's work today. Do not say you will do things tomorrow. If you get behind the class, it is very difficult to get back in front. You cannot finish a race if you rest all the time. Don't be too disappointed if things sometimes go badly. Everyone fails some tests, loses some matches and has bad days. Friends are not always perfect, and they sometimes say and do unpleasant things. Don't let small problems seem very big and important. Talk about problems. Sometimes they are only the result of misunderstanding. Don't be too embarrasssed to ask for help. You are young. No one thinks you can do everything. Plan your time. Don't waste life lying in bed on Saturday morning. Go and play a sport, learn the piano, work on a project, read a book, practise English, or help someone with problems. There are always a lot of things to do. Set targets. If your last grade was a D, work for a C. try to make progress bit by bit. Think of small targets: ""I will speak in class four times this week"", ""I will finish my project on Wednesday"" or ""I will get two more marks this week"". Follow our advice, and have a happy school-life!"	"[""You won't make good progress unless you set big targets""]"

According to the passage, which of the followings has the best time to overcome reading difficulties?	Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go.	['Tom, a boy in the kindergarten.']
The engaging work loved by both teachers and students does NOT include the work which _ .	Students who are engaged in their work are energized by four goals--success, curiosity, originality, and satisfying relationships. How do we cultivate these drives in the classroom? Ten years ago, we began a research project by asking both teachers and students two simple questions: What kind of work do you find totally engaging? and What kind of work do you hate to do? Almost immediately, we noticed distinct patterns in their responses. Engaging work, respondents said, was work that stimulated their curiosity, permitted them to express their creativity, and fostered positive relationships with others. It was also work at which they were good. As for activities they hated, both teachers and students cited work that was repetitive, that required little or no thought, and that was forced on them by others. How, then, would we define engagement? Perhaps the best definition comes from the work of Phil Schlecty (1994), who says students who are engaged exhibit three characteristics: (1) they are attracted to their work, (2) they persist in their work despite challenges and obstacles, and (3) they take visible delight in accomplishing their work. Most teachers have seen these signs of engagement during a project, presentation, or lively class discussion. They have caught glimpses of the inspired inner world of a child, and hoped to sustain this wonder, enthusiasm, and perseverance every day. At the same time, they may have felt held back by traditions of reward and punishment. Our challenge is to go beyond these very real difficulties and provide a practical model for understanding what our students want and need.	['is easy for them to do with little or no thought.']
How did the man feel when the sage hit him with a stone?	"Once there was a man who lied to eat mangoes. One day he decided to get the sweetest mango from the very top of the tree. Mangoes which are exposed to the sun the most are the sweetest. So he climbed up to the top, where the branches were thin. He managed to pick up a few sweet reddish fruits, but, in an attempt to climb down, he slipped and started falling towards the ground. Fortunately, he caught the branch as he was falling and remained helplessly hanging on the tree. Then he started to call nearby villagers for help. They immediately came with a ladder and sticks, but could do little to help him. Then after some time one calm and thoughtful person arrived - a well-known sage who lived in a simple hut nearby. People were very curious to see what he would do, as he was famous in solving many people's problems in the area and sometimes very complicated ones. He was silent for a minute and then picked up a stone and threw it at the hanging man. Everybody was surprised. The hanging mango lover started to shout: What are you doing?! Are you crazy? Do you want me to break my neck?"" The sage was silent. Then he took another stone and threw it at the man. The man was very angry: ""If I could just come down, I would show you!"" That's what everybody wanted - that he came down. But how? Now everybody was tense, as to what would happen next! Some wanted to chastise the sage, but they didn't. The sage picked another stone and threw it again at the man, even more forcefully. Now the man on the tree was enraged and developed a great determination to come down and take revenge. He then used all his skill and strength and somehow reached the branches which were safe to start going down. And he made it! Everybody was amazed. However, the rescued man found the sage gone. He stood there, realizing that the man really sed him because he induced him to try his best and save himself. ""I should be thankful and not angry."""	['He was angry.']

They soon forgot about the coin. After supper, Barton asked for his coin, but nobody could tell where it was. It was lost. One man said that everyone must be searched. One by one they turned their pockets inside out. Only Clinton refused, however.""I didn't steal the coin, and I will not be searched,"" he said.After that, people turned their heads away from Clinton when they met him. He grew poorer. Soon his wife died. A few years later, Barton had his house repaired. The lost coin was found under the floor. Barton felt sorry and went to Clinton to apologize. ""But,"" he asked, ""you knew the coin was not in your pocket. Why did you refuse to be searched?"" ""Because I was a thief,"" Clinton answered. ""My pockets were full of food at that time.

I can look out of the kitchen window while doing the dishes and see the flowers. Every day I drove past the flowers thinking ""I'll stop on my way home and dig them."" ""See. I don't want to get my good clothes dirty."" Whatever the reason, I never stopped to dig them. One day on my way home from work. I was sad to see the pretty blue flowers were gone. I thought to myself. ""You wanted too long. You should have done it when you first saw them blooming this spring."" A week ago we were shocked and sad to learn that my oldest sister-in-law was badly ill. She is 20 years older than my husband and unfortunately, because of age and distance, we haven't been as close as we all would have been. I couldn't help but see the connection between the pretty blue flowers and the relationship between my husband's sister and us. I do believe that God has given us some time left to plant some wonderful memories that will bloom every year for us. And yes, if I see the blue flowers again. You can bet I'll stop and transplant them to my wildflower garden."	['She liked planted flowers']
Hills can be found _ .	Greece today is a small country in southeastern Europe. The population is about nine million, and the capital city is Athens.

At the end of six months, _ .	Without plant, people could not live. We eat plants. We breathe the oxygen that plants produce. And we need plants for another reason: we need them for their beauty. Imagine a world with no plants. Imagine no flowers with their sweet smells, their beautiful colors and their lovely shapes. Imagine when the wind blows, not being able to hear the leaves in the trees or watch the branches sway from side to side. Everywhere people need the beauty of plants. That is why we have parks full of trees and flowers. That is why people always try to design houses with room for some grass and a garden. Do you talk to your plants? Do you give them love and attention? Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, writers of a book called THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS, tell of an experiment in which two seeds were planted in different places. While the plants were growing, one plant was given love and hopeful ideas. The other plant was given only hopeless ideas. After six months, the loved plant was bigger. Under the earth it had more and longer roots; above the earth, it had a thicker stem and more leaves.	['one plant had longer roots than the other and had a thicker stem']
On a clear night we might see things except _ .	How many things can you see in the night sky? A lot! On a clear night you can see the moon, some planets, and thousands of sparking stars.

With bigger and bigger telescopes you can see more and more objects in the sky. And you can see those objects in more and more detail. But scientists believe there are some things in the sky that we will never see. We won't see them with the biggest telescope in the world, on the clearest night of the year.That's because they're _ . They're the mysterious dead stars called black holes. You might find it hard to imagine that stars die. After all, our sun is a star. Year after year we see it up in the sky, burning brightly and giving us heat and light. The Sun certainly doesn't seem to be getting old or weak. But stars do burn out and die after billions of years. As a star's gases burn, they give off light and heat. But when the gases run out, the star stops burning and begins to die. So next time you look up at the night sky, remember: there's more in the sky than we can see!	['the sun']
What can be the best title for the text?	Elephants are trained, at an early age, not to escape. One leg of a baby elephant is tied with a rope to a wooden post planted in the ground. The rope limits the baby elephant to an area determined by the length of the rope. At first the baby elephant tries to break free from the rope, but the rope is too strong. Soon the elephant learns that he cannot break the rope in any case. This space defined by the rope becomes the elephant's comfort zone. As the elephant grows up it could easily break the rope, but it does not even try because it was conditioned as a baby to think that it still could not break free. As a result, the large elephant remains tied and stays in a small space. This metaphor can be used to describe what happens to human beings as we become trapped in a comfort zone. Just as the elephant's space determines what it can do, our comfort zone determines what we are able to achieve. Fortunately, humans are born with the ability to make conscious choices. The elephant doesn't try to break the rope free while we can easily leave our comfort zone. In order to expand our potential and succeed in life, we must expand our comfort zone into unfamiliar fields. You will never realize what you are truly able to achieve if you remain in your comfort zone.	['Expand your comfort zone']
Which of the following is best supported by the text?	"HOUSTON (Reuters) -- Houston tops a U.S. magazine's annual fattest cities list for the fourth time in five years, with four other Texas cities in the top 25. Fast food restaurants -- Houston has twice the national average number -- are partly to blame for the dishonor,Men's Fitnesseditor-in-chief Neal Boulton said. ""Americans work long hours, don't take vacations, and when they're faced with the worst food choices, they indulge in those,"" he said. High humidity, poor air quality and some of the nation's longest commute times also helped Texas' most populous city unseat Detroit, the 2003 heavy weight champion, the magazine said. Houston Mayor Bill White, who has worked with a major food company to develop healthy food products and the city's public schools to improve lunch menus, called the report ""mostly ungrounded and nonsense."" ""On the other hand, it calls attention to real issues the mayor is trying to deal with,"" his spokesman, Frank Michel, said. The magazine said it looked at factors such as the number and types of restaurants, park space, air quality, weather and the number of health clubs. Philadelphia, Detroit, Memphis, Tennessee, and Chicago followed Houston on the seventh edition of the fat list. Texas cities Dallas, San Antonio, Fort Worth and El Paso were in the top 14, which Boulton said was no surprise. ""It's pure big indulgence, just _ , and that's part of the culture,"" said Boulton. Seattle ranked as the fittest city. Austin and Arlington, a Dallas-Fort Worth suburb, were the only Texas cities on the fit list. Austin was 19th and Arlington 22nd out of 25."

He hoped that the trip would give him some new ideas and give him a change in his life. Steven Jobs lived on a farm in California for a year after he returned from India. In 1975, he began to make a new type of computer. He designed the Apple Computer with his friend in his garage. He chose the name ""Apple"" just because it could help him to remember a happy summer he once spent in an apple tree garden. His Apple Computer was so successful that Steven Jobs soon became famous all over the world. He often said, ""I live in order to change the world, there aren't any other reasons. The only way to have a great achievement is to love your own career. If you can't find your favorite career, go on looking for it and never give up."" This is Steven Jobs, though he is dead, his spirit and achievements still influence our lives."	['liked trying new things and making his new ideas come true']
What made Paul feel fine at once?	"Paul couldn't sleep last night. He woke up early and sat up, and then he lay down again. He felt terrible. ""I must be sick,"" he thought. ""but I must study for that test."" He got up and looked for his history notebook. He finally found it under a pile of clothes on a chair. He went over his history notes, but he couldn't remember any of the facts in the notes. ""What shall I do?"" he thought. He felt terrible. Just then Paul's telephone rang. He put down his notebook and picked up the telephone. ""Good morning,"" Jack's voice said, ""You must be wrong about that test."" ""What do you mean?"" Paul asked weakly. ""We're not going to have the test today."" Jack said. ""I wrote down the date in my notebook. The test will be next Wednesday; it isn't today. How do you feel this morning?"" ""Fine,"" said Paul. ""Just fine!"" Suddenly he really felt fine."	['The fact that the test was not to be given that day.']
The best title for this passage is _ .	New rules and behaviour standards for middle school students have come out. The middle school is going to use a new way to decide who the top students are. The best students won't only have high marks. They will also be kids who don't smoke, drink or dye their hair. The following are some of the new rules. Tell the truth. Have you ever copied someone else's work on an exam? Don't do it again! That's not something that an honest student should do. If you have played computer games for two hours in your room, don't tell your parents you have done homework. Do more at school. Good students love animals and care for other people. April is Bird Loving Month in China. Is your school doing anything to celebrate it? You should join! That way, you can learn more about animals and how to protect them. When more people work together, it is more fun for everyone. Have you fought with your teammates when your basketball team lost? Only working together can make your team stronger. Be friendly to the people you are with. Try to think of others, not only yourself. Be open to new ideas. Have you ever thought that people could live on the moon? Maybe you'll discover Earth II someday. Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them because new ideas make life better for everyone. Protect yourself. Has someone ever taken money from one of your classmates? Don't let it happen to you. If you have to go home late, you should let your parents know. Use the Internet carefully. The Internet can be very useful for your studies. But some things on the Internet aren't good for kids, do try to look at _ pages that aren't good for you. You can use the Web for fun or homework. Can't you find any good Web sites for children? Here are some: http://kinds.eastday.com / http://www.chinakids.net.com / http://www.cyenct.com	['Be top students']
The text is probably a _ .	"An Apple employee is in trouble after the prototype of its top-secret iPhone5 was left in a bar. The as yet unreleased prototype was supposedly ""misplaced"" at Cava22 in San Francisco. Apple's security team was called in after reports that it had been sold over the internet for PS120. However, technology website Cnet.co.uk reports that the San Francisco Police Department said Apple had not reported the item as lost. Cava22 owner Jose Valle has said that neither the SFPD nor Apple have contacted him, although he does remember getting calls about a lost iPhone last month. It follows a very similar incident in April 2010 when a then-unreleased iPhone4 was left in a beer garden of a German bar in California by an Apple engineer. The lost iPhone4 was also sold over the internet to the technology blog, which paid PS3,000. The incident led to Apple strengthening its already stiff security, for it seems difficult to believe that a virtually identical incident would happen for the second time in two years."

We can learn from the passage that _ .	"To get an extra 14 years of life, don't smoke, eat lots of fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly and drink alcohol in a proper amount.That is according to a study published this Monday in the Public Library of Science Medicine Journal. After tracking more than 20,000 people aged 45 to 79 years in the United Kingdom from about 1993 to 2007, Kay-Tee Khaw of the University of Cambridge and his colleagues found that people who adopted these four healthy habits lived all average of 14 years longer than those who didn't. ""We've known for a long time that these behaviors are good things to do, but we've not seen this benefit before, ""said Susan Jebb, head of Nutrition and Health at Britain's Medical Research Council.""The benefit was also seen regardless of whether or not people were fat and what social class they came from."" Study participants scored a point each for not smoking, regular physical activity, eating five servings of fruits and vegetables a day and moderate alcohol intake. Public health experts said they hoped the study would inspire governments to introduce policies helping people to adopt these changes.But because the study only observed people rather than testing specific changes, it would be impossible to conclude that people who suddenly adopted these healthy behaviors would surely gain 14 years. ""We can't say that any person could gain 14 years by doing these things, ""said Dr.Tim Armstrong, a physical activity expert at the World Health Organization.""The 14 years is an average across the population of what's theoretically possible."" ""Most people know that things like a good diet matter and that smoking isn't good for them, ""Susan Jebb said.""We need to work on providing people with much more practical support to help them change."""

Which of the following can best describe the team?	"Exhausted,covered in mud and desperately hungry,a team of Swedish athletes sat down for a meal as they prepared to take on a dangerous 20-mile trek through the Ecuadorian rainforest. As they opened their canned meat,a tired Mikael Lindnord noticed a miserable stray dog staring at him out of the corner of his eye. Feeling sorry for him,he fed the dog a meatball and thought nothing of it,but as the team stood up to continue their race the animal started to follow them--and he didn't stop. As the group of four navigated the final two stages of the 430-mile Adventure Racing World Championship,the dog befriended them and was eventually given the name Arthur. Every tiring task the team face,Arthur would do the same.He swam alongside them while they kayaked down rivers,dragged himself up hills during hikes and pulled through knee--deep mud during treks. Even when the team tried to get rid of their new member out of concerns for his safety--he refused to leave.This meant when he was tired they stopped for a break and when he got stuck in the mud they pulled him out. After six days the team finished the race,and the dog had suffered.They therefore decided to take him to a vet while still in South America to have him checked out. During that time Lindord thought to himself that after their experience,they could not leave Arthur,so he decided to adopt him and take him back to Sweden.He applied to the Swedish Board of Agriculture and was made to wait to see if his application was successful.After a tense few days,the team arrived at the airport with Arthur and boarded the plane with him back home. Lindord said:""I came to Ecuador to win the World Championship.Instead,I got a new friend."""	['Friendly and caring.']
In the writer's opinion, what would happen if external examinations were taken away?	We are all interested in equality, but while some people try to protect the school and examination system in the name of equality, others, still in the name of equality, want only to destroy it. Any society which is interested in equality of opportunity and standards of achievement must regularly test its pupils. The standards may be changed ---- no examination is perfect ---- but to have no external tests or examinations would mean the end of equality and of standards. There are groups of people who oppose this view and who do not believe either in external examinations or in any controls in schools or on teachers. This would mean that everything would depend on luck since every pupil would depend on the efficiency, the ideal and the purpose of each teacher. Without external examinations, employers will look for employees from the highly respected schools and from families known to them ---- a form of favoritism will replace equality. At the moment, the bright child from an ill-respected school can show certificates to prove he or she is suitable for a job, while the lack of a certificate shows the unsuitability of a dull child attending a well - respected school. This defense of excellence and opportunity would disappear if external examinations were taken away, and the bright child from a poor family would be a prisoner of his or her school's fame, unable to compete for employment with the child from the favored school. The opponents of the examination system suggest that examinations are an evil force because they show differences between pupils. According to these people, there must be no special, different, academic class. They have even suggested that there should be no form of difference in sport or any other area: all jobs or posts should be filled by unsystematic selection. The selection would be made by people who themselves are probably selected by some computer. These people are not just against school organization, but are at war with the whole idea of modem competitive society and they are using children in schools for their destructive purposes. There is no reason why we should allow such people to determine the way our schools are organized when it is to the obvious disadvantage of the pupils, of the schools and of our society as a whole.

Doctors have proved the following EXCEPT that _	"There is an English saying :""laughter is best medicine .""Until recently ,few people took the saying seriously .Now however ,doctors have begun to look into laughter and the effects it has on the human body .They have found that laughter really can improve people's health . Tests were carried out to study the effects of laughter on the body .People watched funny films while doctors checked their hearts ,blood pressure ,breathing and muscles .It was found that laughter had similar effects to physical exercise .It increases blood pressure ,the heart beating and breathing ; it also works several groups of muscles in the face ,the stomach ,and even the feet .If laughter exercises the body ,it must be beneficial . Other tests have shown that laughter appears to be able to reduce the effect of pain on the body .In one experiment doctors produced pain in groups of students who listened to different radio programmes .The group that tolerated the pain for the longest time was the groups which listened to a funny programme .The reason why laughter can reduce pain seems to be that it helps to produce a kind of chemicals in the brain which _ both stress and pain . As a result of these discoveries ,some doctors in the United States now hold laughter clinics ,in which they help to improve their patients' condition by encouraging them to laugh .They have found that even if their patients do not really feel like laughing ,making them smile is enough to produce beneficial effects similar to those caused by laughter ."

At the end of the story we see that Pete _ .	"Pete Richards was the loneliest man in town on the day that little Jean Grace opened the door of his shop. Pete's grandfather had owned the shop until his death. Then the shop became Pete's. The front window was full of beautiful old things: jewelry of a hundred years ago, gold and silver boxes, carved figures from China and Japan and other nations. On this winter afternoon, a child stood there, her face close to the window. With large and serious eyes, she studied each piece in the window. Then, looking pleased, she stepped back from the window and went into the shop. Pete himself stood behind the counter. His eyes were cold as he looked at the small girl. ""Please,"" she began, ""would you let me look at the pretty string of blue beads in the window?"" Pete took the string of blue beads from the window. The beads were beautiful against his hand as he held the necklace up for her to see. ""They are just right,"" said the child as though she were alone with the beads. ""Will you wrap them up in pretty paper for me, please? I've been looking for a really wonderful Christmas present for my sister."" ""How much money do you have?"" asked Pete. She put a handful of pennies on the counter. ""This is all I have,"" she explained simply. ""I've been saving the money for my sister's present."" Pete looked at her, his eyes thoughtful. Then he carefully closed his hand over the price mark on the necklace so that she could not see it. How could he tell her the price? The happy look in her big blue eyes struck him like the pain of an old wound. ""Just a minute,"" he said and went to the back of the shop. ""What's your name?"" he called out. He was very busy about something. ""Jean Grace,"" answered the child. When Pete returned to the front of the shop, he held a package in his hand. It was wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. ""There you are,"" he said. ""Don't lose it on the way home."" She smiled happily at him as she ran out of the door. Through the window he watched her go. He felt more alone than ever. Something about Jean Grace and her string of beads had made him feel once more the pain of his old grief. The child's hair was as yellow as the sunlight; her eyes were as blue as the sea. Once upon a time, Pete had loved a girl with hair of that same yellow and with eyes just as blue. And the necklace of blue stones had been meant for her. But one rainy night, a car had gone off the road and struck the girl. After she died, Pete felt that he had nothing left in the world except his grief. The blue eyes of Jean Grace brought him out of that world of self-pity and made him remember again all that he had lost. The pain of remembering was so great that Pete wanted to run away from the happy Christmas shoppers who came to look at his beautiful old things during the next ten days. When the last shopper had gone, late on Christmas Eve, the door opened and a young woman came in. Pete could not understand it, but he felt that he had seen her before. Her hair was sunlight yellow and her eyes were sea-blue. Without speaking, she put on the counter a package wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. When Pete opened the package, the string of blue beads lay again before him. ""Did this come from your shop?"" she asked. Pete looked at her with eyes no longer cold. ""Yes, it did,"" he said. ""Are the stones real?"" ""Yes. They aren't the best turquoise , but they are real."" ""Can you remember to whom you sold them?"" ""She was a small girl. Her name was Jean. She wanted them for her sister's Christmas present."" ""How much were they?"" ""I can't tell you that,"" he said. ""The seller never tells anyone else what a buyer pays."" ""But Jean has never had more than a few pennies. How could she pay for them?"" "" "" he said. For a moment there was no sound in the little shop. Then somewhere in the city, church bells began to ring. It was midnight and the beginning of another Christmas Day. ""But why did you do it?"" the girl asked. Pete put the package into her hands. ""There is no one else to whom I can give a Christmas present,"" he said. ""It is already Christmas morning. Will you let me take you to your home? I would like to wish you a Merry Christmas at your door."" And so, to the sound of many bells, Pete Richards and a girl whose name he had not yet learned walked out into the hope and happiness of a new Christmas Day."	['regained his ability to love']
What can we learn from the text?	"As we get older, most of us worry about grey hair, wrinkles and maintaining a youthful body. But people often don't realize the voice needs looking after. Here, Mr. Rubin, a voice expert, reveals how to keep your voice youthful. Drink more fluid and avoid spicy food You need water for the vocal cords to vibrate well. The body must be kept hydrated enough to make the vocal cords operate well. Drinking 1.5 liters of water a day at intervals of 15 minutes is very important. Mr. Rubin advises avoiding foods with an annoying effect on the stomach, such as onions, chili, fizzy drinks and chocolate. Rest the throat and talk regularly The vocal cords can be scared if you use your voice during a bad cough. If you have a case of laryngitis with a cold, you should rest your voice for a day or two, and seek medical advice. Simply staying sociable and using your voice is very important. ""As older people get less mobile, they can become socially isolated and speak less."" says Mr. Rubin. ""The elderly need to communicate with people more. By using the vocal cords, they enable the ageing process to slow down. "" Improve your posture Good posture is essential to keeping the voice young, so we'd better stand properly. Exercise helps you take deeper breaths as it means there is better airflow through the voice box, producing a stronger tone. Sing in the shower This is one of the best ways to preserve your voice, as it keeps the larynx muscles strong while the steam lubricates the voice box. ""Singing is gymnastics for the voice,"" says Mr. Rubin. Joining a choir is one of the best ways to preserve a youthful tone."

Damasio's study suggests that _ .	Decisions, decisions! Our lives are full of them, from the small ones to the life-changing. The right to choose is central to everyone. Yet sometimes we make bad decisions that leave us unhappy or full of regret. Can science help? Most of us know little about the mental processes that lie behind our decisions. Luckily, what psychologists are finding may help us all make better choices. Here are some of their amazing discoveries to help you make up your mind. Consider your emotions. You might think that emotions are the enemy of decision making, but in fact they're a part of it. Whenever you make up your mind, your brain's emotional center is active. University of Southern California scientist, Antonio Damasio, has studied people with damage to only the emotional parts of their brains, and found that they were unable to make basic choices about what to wear or eat. Damasio thinks this may be because our brains store emotional memories of past choices, which we use to help the present decision making. However, making choices under the influence of an emotion can greatly affect the result. Take anger, for example. A study by Nitika Garg of the University of Mississippi and other scientists found the angry shoppers were more likely to choose the first thing they were offered rather than considering other choices. It seems anger can lead us to make quick decisions without much thinking. All emotions affect our thinking and motivation , so it may be best to avoid making important decisions under their influence. Yet strangely there's one emotion that seems to help us make good choices. The American researchers found that sad people took time to consider the various choices on offer, and ended up making the best choices. In fact many studies show that people who feel unhappy have the most reasonable view of the world.	['our emotional memories of past choices can affect present decisions']
How many Alfred's teachers are mentioned in the passage?	I'm Alfred. I was born with a problem in my backbone and mobility was a big challenge, but thanks to my teachers and friends, my school life was excellent. My friends and I used to sit together and have lots of fun. Whenever we got a free period, we used to start shouting or play games. I would take part in all competitions, such as poetry writing, story writing and painting and all activities like Teachers' Day or anybody's birthday and had much fun. My English teacher was very tall. The moment she would enter the class, we would all sit quiet and open the books. She would encourage me by giving me important assignments and also morning news to read during the assembly. She would come down and hear my English debate , which made me participate in all debate competitions. The same was true of my biology and science teacher. She was very nice and sweet. She would always give me extra information on the biology project. I could not go to the lab for the practicals (lessons or exams in science, cooking etc. in which you have to do or make something yourself rather than write or read about it), so she would bring the lab down and help me with the biology and science practicals and would give me excellent marks. My friends made me monitor and the naughty boys listen to me. My friends used to help me with my notes if I was absent. My teachers always gave me important project work and I felt proud when they _ after I finished it quickly and correctly. I was never shouted at or made fun of or scolded by any of my friends and teachers. Today I saw the terrible punishments given to students on television news. I felt very sad. I really want to express my love and thanks to all my wonderful teachers and friends, without whom my school life would not have been so excellent and unforgettable. I really pray to God that each child in the world is blessed with caring teachers and wants to attend school every day.	['Two.']
What's the best title for the passage?	At present time, roller skating is easy and fun. But many years ago, it wasn't easy at all. Before 1750, people never tried skating on wheels. That changed because of a man named Joseph Merlin. Merlin's work was making instruments . In his free time he liked to play the violin. Merlin was a man with many ideas and many dreams. People called him a dreamer. One day Merlin received an invitation to go to an important party. He was very pleased and a little excited. As the day of the party came near, Merlin began to think. He wanted to find a way to make a wonderful entrance at the party. Merlin had an idea. He thought that he would attract a lot of attention if he could skate into the room. Merlin tried different ways to make himself roll . Finally, he decided to put two wheels under each shoe. These were the first roller skate shoes. Merlin was very proud of them. He dreamed of arriving at the party and skating into the room while playing the violin. He was sure that everyone would be very surprised. On the night of the party Merlin rolled into the room, playing his violin. Everyone was really surprised to see him. There was just one problem. Merlin had no way to stop his roller skating. He rolled on, playing the violin. Then, with all eyes on him, Merlin hit into a huge mirror on the wall. The mirror broke into many pieces with a very loud noise. Nobody forgot Merlin's wonderful entrance after that.	['How Roller Skating Was Invented']
According to the authour,which of the following can make sitting worker tired?	"Here is an astonishing and signficant fact:Mental work alone can't make us tired. It sounds absurd. But a few years ago, scientists tried to find out how long the human could labor without reaching a stage of fatigue . To the amazement of these scientists, they discovered thett blood passing through the brain, when it is active, shows no fatigue at all! If we took a drop of blood from a day labourer, we could find it full of fatigue toxins and fatigue products. But if we took blood from the brain of Albert Einstein, it would show no fatigue toxing at the end of the day. So far as the brain is concerned, it can work as well and swiftly at the end of eight or even twelve hours f efforts as at the beginning. The brain is totally tireless. So what makes us tired. Some scientists declare that most of our fatigue come from our mental and emotional attitudes. One of England's most outstanding scientists. J. A. Hadfield,says,""The greater part of the fatigue from which we suffer is of mental origin. In fact,fatigue of purely physical origin is rare."" Dr. Brill, a famous American scientist, goes even further. He declares,""One hundred percent of the fatigue of a sitting worker in good health is due to emotional problems."" What kinds of emotions make sitting workers tired?Joy?Satifaction?No!A feeling of being bored,anger,anxiety,tenseness,worry,a feeling of nt being appreciated---those are emotions that tire sitting workers.Hard work by itself seldom causes fatigue.We get tired because our emotions produce nervousness in the body."

The story is mainly written to_.	"You hear this,""No wonder you are fat.All you ever d0 is eat.""You feel sad.""I skip my breakfast and supper.I run every morning and evening.What else can I do?"" Basically you can do nothing.Your genes,not your life habits,determine your weight and your body constantly tries to maintain it. Albert Stunkard of the University of Pennsylvania found from experiments that""80 percent of the children of two fat parents become fat,as compared with no more than 14.percent of the children of two parents of normal weight."" How can obese people become thinner through dieting? Well,dieting can be effective.but the health costs are great. Jules Hirsch,a research physician at Rockefeller University,did a study of eight fat people.They were.given a liquid formula providing 600 calories a day.After more than 10 weeks,the subjects lost on average 45 kg.But after leaving the hospital,they all regained the weight. The results were surprising:by metabolic measurement,fat people who lost large amounts of weight seemed like they were starving.They had psychiatric problems.They dreamed of food or of breaking their diet They were anxious and depressed.Some wanted to kill themselves.They hid food in their rooms. Researchers warn that it is possible that weight reduction doesn't result in normal weight,but in an abnormal state lust like that of starved non.obese people. Thin people, however,suffer from the opposite.They have to make a great effort to gain weight Ethan Sims of the University of Vermont got prisoners to volunteer to gain weight.In four to six months--they ate as much as they could.They succeeded in increasing their weight by 20 to 25 percent. But months after the study ended,they were back to normal weight and stayed there. This did not mean that people are completely without hope in controlling their weight.It means that those who tend to be fat will have to constantly battle their genetic inheritance if they want to significantly 1ower their weight. The findings also provide evidence for something scientists thought was true--each person has a comfortable weight range.The range might be as much as 9kg.Someone might weigh 60--69kg without too much effort.But,going above or below the natural weight range is difficult.The body resists by feeling hungry or full and changing.the metabolism to push the weight back to the range it seeks."

How many times did the author describe Bryan's eyes?	"This week was busier than usual, and I was very tired today. All I wanted to do was to go home and enjoy a bowl of good hot soup. But when I saw my daughter's car, _ Since his parents separated, I had tried to have my six-year-old grandson spend a few hours with me at least once a week. I had always tried to make it a special time for him. We did many interesting things; Bryan loved all these activities, and so did I. But today I had to give up our evening. I said how tired I was feeling. ""Bryan, I'm sorry. Tonight I don't feel like having fun or playing games. We'll have our night together some other time."" I saw the sadness in Bryan's eyes. He said, ""I like soup, Grandma."" I knew he meant ""Please don't send me away. Please let me stay."" I saw the shadow in Bryan's eyes. Something else was changing. Maybe he thought I wouldn't want to have him come any more -- not tonight, not next week, not ever. Finally, I said OK. I was glad to see his eyes light up. After I put the soup on the stove and turned on the TV, I fell asleep. When I woke up, there was a coat over my legs, and the soup was gone. Bryan was on the floor, reading a coloring book and watching a television show at the same time. The poor boy must have been so bored ! When he found I was awake, he ran over and gave me a big hug. ""I love you, Grandma,"" he said. ""Haven't we had a nice time together?"" His big smile and happy eyes told me that this time he meant exactly what he was saying. That was the keyword -- together. We had done nothing exciting or special. But we were together."	['4.']
Leave a pail with warm water and another pail with cold water in the same low temperature, you'll find that _ .	Warm water freezes more quickly than cold water. Sir Francis Bacon said that almost four hundred years ago. But few people believed him until 1970. In that year a Canadian scientist George Kill proved the English professor was right. Dr Kill filled an open oil pail with cold water. He filled another with warm water. He put both in the same low temperature. The warm water froze first. The lack of covers on the pails is the secret. Some of the warm water changed into vapor. This meant that less of the warm water was left to be frozen. And so the warm water froze faster than the cold water even though it had a greater temperature drop to make.	['warm water turns into ice before cold water']

The passage mainly talks about _ .	A third of Britons are overweight, states a report published in January by the Royal College of Physicians, the result of an 18-month study. About five per cent of children weigh too much, and are likely to stay that way for life; in the mid-twenties-age-long group the proportion of the middle-aged population half are overweight. Fat people risk severe health problems, says the report, including high blood pressure, breathlessness and various forms of heart disease. Smoking is particularly risky for overweight people. The safest way to lose weight is to eat cereals, bread, fruit and vegetables, and cut down on fatty meals, butter and sweet foods. Fad diets so far more than good; slimming machines that vibrate muscles have not been proved useful; saunas merely remove a little body water, and health farms, says the report ,serve as expensive holidays. Exercise is most important to health, the report emphasizes; though it doesn't necessarily reduce weight; it keeps the correct proportion of body muscle. And it isn't only for the young ; from middle age a minimum of 20 minutes of gentle physical jerks should be practiced three times a week. The report advocates several public health measures to fight the common existence of overweight in this country. They include an increase of tax on alcohol to reduce its increasing, and dangerously fattening, consumption; and the provision of more sports facilities by local authorities. Britain's doctors, the report concludes, must learn to be more sympathetic and specific in their advice to the overweight, encouraging a change in eating habits on a long-term basis and taking into account the many-often-complex-reasons why fat people are fat.

The whole passage is mainly about_.	In the future your automobile will run on water instead of gas! You will be able to buy a supercomputer that fits in your pocket! You might even drive a flying car! For each prediction that has come true today, several others have missed by a mile. Many of these predictions didn't consider how people would want to use the technology. Or if people really needed it in their lives or not. Let's look at some predictions from the not - too - distant past. Robot Helpers Where's the robot in my kitchen? Nowhere, of course. And he's probably not coming anytime soon. Robots do exist today, but mostly in factories and other Manufacturing environments. Back in the 1950s, however, people said that by now personal robots would be in most people's home. So why hasn't happened? Probably because robots are still too expensive and Clumsy. And maybe the idea of robots cooking our dinners and washing our clothes is just too _ . At home we seem to be doing fine without them. Telephones of tomorrow? In 1964 an American company introduced the video telephone. They said by the year 2000 most people would have a video phone in their homes. But of course the idea hasn't caught on yet. Why? The technology worked fine, but it overlooked something obvious: peoples desire for privacy. Would you want to have a video phone conversation with someone after you just stepped out of the shower? Probably not - it could be embarrassing! Just because a technology is available doesn't always mean people will want to use it. And finally, how about that crazy prediction of the flying car? It's not so crazy anymore! But a flying car remains one of the most fascinating technology ideas to capture our imagination. Keep watching the news - or perhaps the sky outside your window - to see what the future will bring.	"[""predictions that haven't come true""]"

What can we learn about Talk to the Hand?	"Gimmicky--and expensive--new gloves allow chatterboxes to take the term 'handsfree' to a new level--by talking into them as they make a call. The gloves are known as 'Talk to the Hand' and costPS1.000 a pair. They come with a speaker unit embedded into the thumb and a microphone built into the little finger that can be connected to any mobile handset using Bluetooth.Artist Sean Miles designed the gloves that double as a phone in part of his project that shows the possibilities of gadget recycling.He combines gloves with parts from mobile handsets recycled through O2,which commissioned the project. Mobile phone users will be able to keep their hands warm while they chat without taking their phone out of their pocket or handbag. Mr Miles designed two pairs of the new gloves--one in pink and the other in brown and yellow.They will appear in an exhibition this July and visitors will be able to win the gloves.If demand is high,they will then be produced on a larger scale. O2 Recycle,which backs the project,estimates that there are already 70 million unused mobile handsets in the UK.The service pays those who recycle gadgets including phones,MP3 players and digital cameras. Designer Scan Miles,hopes his work will get people thinking about recycling.The 41-year-old said:""I hope that my Talk to the Hand project will get people to think again about the waste created by not recycling gadgets.If a few more people recycle their gadgets rather than send them to landfill ,I think this project will have fulfilled its aim."" The Talk to the Hand mobile phone gloves are the second product in a series that O2 Recycle and Miles have created.Miles is now working on combining phones with handbags--so people don't spend time rummaging around in their bags to find a phone when it rings."

It can be inferred from the text that _ .	"My father passed away in a nursing home on a September day. I never remembered him telling me he loved me. Upon hearing his death, I didn't feel the need to cry. I struggled with my lack of strong feelings over his passing, knowing it was not healthy for me to avoid sadness. On Christmas Day of the year, I was reflecting on as many good memories of my father as I could. I decided to work out my feelings, so I sat down and wrote my father a letter. Dear Daddy, I remember something today. I remember when I was 3 years old, mom carried me right before bedtime and you sang ""Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep"" to me, and I remember your voice like it was just yesterday. I remember the warmth of you lying next to me and how special I felt at that moment. Then my mom carried me off to my own bed to tuck me in. I remember times when I could sit out on the porch with you and watch an approaching thunderstorm, and you would tell me the scientific facts behind lightning and thunder. I thought you knew everything. I remember you taking my two brothers and me on trips to a stream out in the country on summer days. We would walk along the stream, picking wildflowers to take home to mother. I want to thank you for giving me an appreciation of nature and science and of God's beautiful creation, Earth. I want to thank you for making us take part in ""family worship"" every evening after dinner. I remember that Bible stories and the Golden Rule on how to treat others, and I learnt how to appreciate music in my life from the hymns we sang. I also learnt to harmonize with my sisters. And most of all, I want to forgive you. I forgive you for not being able to tell me that I was a special girl and that you loved me. I longed for your spoken affection. But I realize something in your own upbringing would not allow you to express your feelings verbally . I realize that you did the best that you could with what you knew. I signed the letter and put it into my wooden box to join many other cards and letters from my family and loved ones that I cherished. But somehow, it had not brought any relief I desired. On New Year's Eve, I remember the letter to my father. I took it outside to the yard. Then I built a fire and dropped it into the flame and watched it burn. As I thanked my father for giving me life, the tears came. I released all the grief and whispered, ""you were my father... and I love you."""

When did the ViewMaster become popular?	"The early 1900s were very different from today, when toys were still the delight of children everywhere. Theodore Roosevelt's Presidency marks the beginning of the ""Teddy Bear"". In the year 1902,toy bears were named ""Teddy"" after the president's nickname. The Teddy Bear became known worldwide and it was only a few years later that the Teddy Bears were mass produced. In 1913,an item called the Erector Set was invented. It was a steel,motorized toy that children could use to build models of anything. Its creator was A.C.Gilbert,a medical doctor. Charles Pajeau created a similar wooden set called Tinker Toys in the year 1914.Tinker Toys were made for younger children. Raggedy Ann dolls first came on the scene after newspaper cartoonist Johnny Gruelle reproduced the doll he made for his daughter. That was in 1915. The following year,an architect's son named John Lloyd Wright,invented Lincoln Logs,which were interlocked to make structures. Two years after Mickey Mouse was created,stuffed Mickey Mouse dolls were made by Charlotte Clark. This was the start of Disney merchandise. The yoyo became popular in the United States after Donald Duncan bought a yoyo company in 1929. The ViewMaster,a three dimensional viewer,was developed by a camera enthusiast named William Gruber. The toy became popular when Gruber licensed Disney characters to make still, 3D images from Disney movies and television programs. Finally,in 1940,model airplanes were mass produced. They started out as a way for manufacturers to sell planes to the military,but later caught on as a toy. The toys that we know and love today have had their roots from these ancient times. Thanks to all these creative man's efforts, we know otherwise what we may never know."	['After Gruber licensed Disney characters']
"""Mother trees"" are extremely important because they _ ."	"Would it surprise you to learn that, like animals, trees communicate with each other and pass on their wealth to the next generation? UBC Professor Simard explains how trees are much more complex than most of us ever imagined. Although Charles Darwin thought that trees arc competing for survival of the fittest, Simard shows just how wrong he was. In fact, _ : trees survive through their co-operation and support, passing around necessary nutrition ""depending on who needs it"". Nitrogen and carbon are shared through miles of underground fungi networks, making sure that all trees in the forest ecological system give and receive just the right amount to keep them all healthy. This hidden system works in a very similar way to the networks of neurons in our brains, and when one tree is destroyed, it affects all. Simard talks about ""mother trees"", usually the largest and oldest plants on which all other trees depend. She explains how dying trees pass on the wealth to the next generation, transporting important minerals to young trees so they may continue to grow. When humans cut down ""mother trees"" with no awareness of these highly complex ""tree societies"" or the networks on which they feed, we are reducing the chances of survival for the entire forest. ""We didn't take any notice of _ ."" Simard says sadly. ""Dying trees move nutrition into the young trees before dying, but we never give them chance."" If we could put across the message to the forestry industry, we could make a huge difference towards our environmental protection efforts for the future."	['pass on nutrition to young trees']
On the first night of the writer's cost-cutting plan, her children _ .	"Lie in bed, by an open window, and listen... ""No air conditioning? How can you sleep?"" a friend asks, horrified. I tell her my family has decided to shut the air conditioner off and reduce our electric bill. On this first night of our cost-cutting plan, it's only 85 degrees. We're going to suffer, but the three kids complain anyway. They have grown up in 72-degree comfort, protected from the world outside. ""It's too hot to sleep,"" my 13-year-old daughter complains. ""I'm about to die from this heat,"" her brother complains down the hall. ""Just try it tonight,"" I tell them. In truth I'm too tired to turn for long. My face is sweaty, but I lie quietly listening to the cricket choirs outside that remind me of childhood. The neighbor's dog howls. Probably a passing squirrel. It's been years since I took the time to really listen to the night. I think about grandma, who lived to 92 and still helped with my mom's gardening until just a few weeks before she died. And then, I'm back there at her house in the summer heat of my childhood. I move my pillow to the foot of grandma's bed and turn my face toward the open window. I turn the pillow, hunting for the cooler side. Grandma saw me turn over and over. ""If you just watch for the breeze ,"" she said, ""you'll cool off and fall asleep."" I stare at the filmy white curtain, willing it to move. Lying still, waiting, I suddenly notice the life outside the window. The bug chorus. Neighbors, porch -sitting late, speak in unclear words that calm me. ""Mom, did you hear that?"" my seven-year-old son cries, ""I think it was an owl family."" ""Probably,"" I tell him, ""just keep listening..."" Without the working air conditioner, the house is peaceful, and the natural night noises seem close enough to touch. I hope I'm awake tonight when the first breeze comes in."	['begin to be unhappy']
When Peng Jiangya was a child, she learned to _ without fingers	"Peng Jiangya, a 24-year-old girl, was born in Guizhou Province. She lives in a village of the Yinjiang Tujia and Miao Autonomous County at the foot of the Fanjing Mountains on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau . Twenty-two years ago, One day her parents were out, she fell into a fire stove at home, and the fire burned her fingers badly. The family was too poor at the time to afford the expensive medical treatment ,at last she lost all her fingers. ""When I was a child, I was unable to hold chopsticks. My parents taught me for a long time. It was really difficult, but I tried it over and over again ,and at the age of seven, I overcame it. From then on I knew that one had to put great efforts into what she was doing,"" said PengJiangya. As a child , PengJiangya often saw others make cross-stitch and then she decided to learn how to make it herself. "" Of course, it took me many years to do that, when I was 18, I got it."" Said Peng. Now she can make as good cross-stitch works as her companions ,but she is faster than other people. Her hometown of Yinjiang Tujia at the foot of the Fanjing Mountains on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateauhas become a tourist attraction.

the writer develop the article mainly by _	Last week, my granddaughter started primary school. And I wished her every success. But part of me didn't. I really wanted her to fail in some ways because I believe that failure can be good for us to grow up. Success is that you can do something that you already know you can do, or doing something correctly the first time. First -time success is usually a luck. First-time failure, in fact, is supposed to be the natural order of things. Failure is how we learn. I make my living by writing articles for a daily newspaper. Each week I thought that the article that I write would be the worst. I try my best every day. A successful article usually means that I am discussing the subjects I know well, writing in the way I am used to or saying the same things as anyone else but in an excellent way. My younger daughter is a trapeze artist.she spent three years putting together a show, and she did it successfully for years. There was no reason for her to change it but she did anyway. She was afraid to be bored. She met failure when she tried some new ways in her show. But she did his only in order to feed her soul. My granddaughter is a perfectionist. She will feel her failures, and I will want to _ her. But I will also, I hope, remind her of what she learned, and how she can do better next time. I hope I can tell her, though, that it's not the end of the world. With luck, it is the beginning.	['giving examples']
Why, according to the passage, do many people try to keep up with the Joneses?	"It is said that in the United States much has been told about that anyone can become rich and successful if he works hard and has some good luck. Yes, when one becomes rich he wants people to know it. And even though he does not become very rich, he wants people to think that he is. That's what ""Keeping up with the Joneses "" is about The expression was first used in 1913 by a young American called Arthur Momand looked around him and noticed that many people did things to keep up with their neighbours. He called it ""Keeping up with the Joneses"", because Jones is a very common name in the United States. ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" came to mean keeping up with the people around you. Momand's series appeared in different newspapers across the country for over 28 years. People never seem to get tired of keeping up with the Joneses. That is one reason why they read ""right"" books, go to ""right"" universities and eat in ""right"" restaurants. Every city has an area where people want to live because others will think better of them if they do. And there are Joneses in every city of the world. But one must get tired of trying to keep up with the Joneses, because no matter what one does, Mr Jones always seems to be ahead."	['Because they want others to know or think they are rich.']
What's the main idea of the passage?	"Americans love their cars. There are more than eight cars for every 10 Americans, but most of the time, they sit idle , parked in a driveway or on the street. Now, several companies on the U. S. West Coast are helping people rent their personal car to someone else when they don't need it. Eric Loebel is one of those people. For a small price, he wants to let his Oregon neighbors ""borrow"" his car. It's a dark blue, model year 2000 Volvo car. The sales and marketing consultant says he doesn't use it much. ""My wife and I are huge bike commuters and almost don't need a car,"" he says. Loebel is one of the first car owners in Portland to list his wheels for rent through a so-called ""peer-to-peer car sharing"" service called Getaround. Com. ""Cars are so expensive to own,"" he says ""This can definitely offset some of the cost."" The website lets car owners decide for themselves how much to charge borrowers to rent by the hour, day or week. Person-to-person rentals began in Germany a decade ago, and there are a handful of similar companies in Europe and Australia. The concept caught on quickly in California over the past year according to John Atcheson, vice president of Getaround, one of four carsharing startups in the San Francisco area. ""We have had amazing cars leaping into our system,"" Atcheson says. ""Not just 1995 pickup trucks but we have had late model Mercedes, Audis, any type of car you can imagine. We actually have a Tesla Roadster--a $150,000 sports car."" Another service called JustShareIt plans to stand out by going beyond cars. Its founder says the company will offer person-to-person rentals of power boats, jet skis and snowmobeles( ) too."	['Americans try renting their cars to strangers.']

If you see fresh goods first in the supermarket, _ .	"People in cities all over the world shop in supermarkets. Who decides what you buy in the supermarket? Do you decide? Does the supermarket decide? When you enter the supermarket, you see shelves full of food. You walk in the aisles between the shelves. You push a shopping cart and put your food in it. You probably hear soft, slow music as you walk along the aisles. This may be an attempt to please you, so you will enjoy shopping. Some supermarkets want to increase their profits by playing soft and slow music, because the slow music makes you walk slowly and you have more time to buy things. Fresh fruit and vegetables are usually put near the entrance. When you arrive at the supermarket, you think about the kinds of fruit and vegetables you need first. Once you've got that out of the way, you can relax and do the rest of the shopping without any hurry. Besides, if you see fresh goods first, it gives you a ""feel good"" impression of freshness, so you can not help spending your money. Maybe you go to the meat department then. There is some meat on sale, and you want to find it. The manager of the supermarket knows where customers enter the meat department. The cheaper meat is at the other end of the meat department, away from where the customers enter. You have to walk past all the expensive meat before you find the cheaper meat. Maybe you will buy some of the expensive meat instead of the meat on sale. Most of the food in supermarkets is very attractive. It all says ""Buy me quickly!"" to the customers. The fresh fruit and vegetables say ""Buy me quickly!"" as you walk by. The expensive meat says ""Buy me quickly!"" The supermarket tells you what to buy."	"[""you'll get a fresh impression""]"
Which statement is TRUE according to the passage ?	There are three different ways to store fish. Two ways to store fish for future use are canning and freezing. Two other methods are drying and smoking. Today we have the first of the two reports describing, step by step, how to prepare dried fish. Begin with the fish that are just out of water. If the fish are small, leave their heads on. Cut off the heads if the fish are longer than twenty centimeters or weigh more than one hundred fifteen grams. Now clean the freshly caught fish. Cut off the scales and cut open the stomach. Remove everything inside. Then wash the fish in clean water and rub salt into them. Next, put the fish in a container with a solution of three hundred grams of salt and one liter of water. This will remove the blood from the meat. Keep the fish in the salt water for about thirty minutes. After that, wash them again in clean water. Next, put the fish in a solution that has more salt in the water. The water should be salty enough so that the fish float to the top. If the fish sink to the bottom of the container, add more salt to the water. Cover the container with a clean piece of wood. Place a heavy stone on the wood to hold it down. Leave the fish there for about six hours. After that remove them from the salt water and place them on a clean surface. Cover the fish with a clean piece of white cloth and let them dry. Another method of preparing fish is called dry salting. Wooden boxes or baskets are used for drying salting. After cleaning the fish, put a few of them on the bottom of the box or basket. Cover them with salt, then put more fish on top. Cover them also with salt. Continuing putting fish and salt in the container until it is full. Do not use too much salt when using the dry salting method. You should use one part salt to three parts fish. For example, if you have three kilograms of fish, you should use one kilogram of salt. Remove the fish after a week or ten days. Wash them in a mixture of water or a small amount of salt and let them dry. We have talked a lot about salt. keep in mind that doctors advise people to limit the sodium in their diet. It can raise blood pressure, and some people have more of a reaction than others.	['While using the dry salting method, you should hold the fish with wooden boxes.']
The hippo envied the bird because _ .	Once upon a time,a hippo lived in a river next to a big tree. One day,a bird came and nested in the tree.The songs of the bird filled the hippo with so much envy that he couldn't think of anything else.Every day he would think why he wasn't born to be a bird even though the bird told him many times he was so lucky to be so big and such a good swimmer. Finally,the hippo made up his mind that he would come out of the river,climb the tree and start singing.However,when he tried to climb the tree,it was very clear that the hippo didn't have wings,nor claws to climb with. Realizing that he would never climb up the tree,he angrily hit the tree until it came crashing to the ground.Then he stepped onto the leaves of the fallen tree,and began singing. Unfortunately,hippos can't sing,either.All that came from his mouth were terrible noises,and when the other animals heard this,they all came around to make fun of the hippo. He was so ashamed by this.He also felt bad about having knocked the tree over.He used all his strength to raise the tree back up again,and look after it until it completely recovered. .

Which of the following can best describe their present life?	"We thought we had it all---a beautiful house, three healthy children and one more on the way, two cars, a couple of four-wheelers for entertainment---and we loved it. Then, the market turned and my husband's job at a construction company was gone. The company was closing down for good.We both started looking for jobs right away, but there weren't any to be found. With each passing day we were getting increasingly worried and we continued to work together in order to pull our family through. _ I felt feelings of admiration for my husband that I hadn't felt in years. That's why it was so hard for me to watch him blame himself for our present situation. I continually asked him to stop, but he seemed to want to punish himself for not having a job. Finally, one afternoon I pulled him aside and said, ""We have four healthy children and each other. That's what's important. That makes you a rich man."" "" But what if we lose the house? They'll hate me--you'll hate me,"" he replied. I smiled at him and put my hands on both sides of his face to make him look me in the eye. ""No matter where we live I will be happy -as long as I have you."" I smiled again. In all the struggling together I had found that deep love for him that I had on the day we said ""I do"".

How many things does Linda predict ?	"What do you think the future will be like? Here are some answers from some students. Mary: If we don't take good care of the earth now, our children and grandchildren will be born into a world with much pollution . There will be fewer trees and more buildings, because there will be more people. Jack: I agree with Mary. Things will be worse . The weather in the future will be much hotter. Humans won't be able to live on the earth. They will have to look for another planet to live on. Linda: I think the life in the future will be better. Most people in the world will use ""green cars"" by 2020, so there will be less pollution and people will live to be 200 years old. As for space travel, I would say, we will visit Mars in about fifty years."	['Four']
What will the next section mainly talk about?	"Do you know someone who has never been troubled by tests? Yeah, some people are lucky like that. But for most of us, taking tests can cause a lot of icky feelings and sensations, such as: trouble concentrating; low selfesteem; being nervous or anxious; feeling depressed or down on yourself; nausea ,indigestion, diarrheas ,or other stomach problems; racing heartbeat or trouble breathing; trouble sleeping; sweaty or cold hands. Spend a moment thinking about a test you have to take. Does it bring on any of these feelings? If so, that might mean you're having some trouble dealing with the stress of the test. Now that we know what stress feels like, let's talk about where test stress comes from. Here are a few of the biggest causes of test stress: *Pressure from yourself.It's important to do your best and study hard, but if you feel like you just can't stop pushing yourself to prepare or that you won't be happy with anything but a high grade, that pressure can't be hard to handle. *Pressure from parents and teachers.Most parents want to see great report cards, and they can start pushing when test time comes around. For teachers, many schools want to show high test grades from their students. So they have high expectations for the teachers, who then have high expectations for the students! *Competition with friends.You love your best friends, but she's always asking you how you did in the test you both just took. This is normal, but can add to some of the pressure you're already feeling. *Past experience.If you had a bad time with a test in the past, or if you've done poorly in one or more tests, you could feel anxious about the next one. *Negative thinking.If you're convinced you're going to fail, or you keep beating yourself up with thoughts like""I'm not smart enough""or""I never do well,"" this can add to a lot of stress. *Rumor. Sometimes, other students can spread rumors about a rest. Rumores like ""That teacher's tests are totally impossible to pass!"" can make you a lot more nervous."

Which of the following can best explain why Wang Xiaoyu fainted in class?	"A quarrel at home may result in your falling ill. Don't laugh, it's true. Family matters including living habits and even the way we speak have a big effect on our health, doctors say. Wang Xiaoyu, a Senior 2 girl from Xichang, Sichuan Province, fainted in class when she heard her classmates quarrel at the top of their voices. Quarrels between her parents also put the girl into a _ . It is because she is suffering from depression , caused by bad relations at home, doctors explained. ""We don't get sick or stay well by ourselves,"" says Dr Robert Ferrer from the US. Ferrer shows that family forces may explain up to a quarter of health problems, in his recent research. The genes you get from your family may cause illness. If one of your parents has a heart attack, your risk of being affected may double. But effects on health are not only written in our DNA. Unrelated people who live under the same roof also get similar problems. Diet, lifestyle and environment affect our health, too. Ferrer's research also found that if teenagers feel they are ignored or unimportant at home they are more likely to get sick. We may never fully understand all the effects that families have on our health. But just as individual problems can have effects on others, a small improvement can have big benefits, Ferrer said."

In her first few days at the author's house, Goldie _ .	"Goldie's Secret She turned up at the doorstep of my house in Cornwall. No way could I have sent her away. No way, not me anyway. Maybe someone had kicked her out of their car the night before. ""We're moving house.""; ""No space for her any more with the baby coming."" ""We never really wanted her, but what could we have done? She was a present."" People find all sorts of excuses for abandoning an animal. And she was one of the most beautiful dogs I had ever seen. I called her Goldie. If I had known what was going to happen I would have given her a more creative name. She was so unsettled during those first few days. She hardly ate anything and had such an air of sadness about her. There was nothing I could do to make her happy, it seemed. Heaven knows what had happened to her at her previous owner's. But eventually at the end of the first week she calmed down. Always by my side, whether we were out on one of our long walks or sitting by the fire. That's why it was such a shock when she pulled away from me one day when we were out for a walk. We were a long way from home, when she started barking and getting very restless. Eventually I couldn't hold her any longer and she raced off down the road towards a farmhouse in the distance as fast as she could. By the time I reached the farm I was very tired and upset with Goldie. But when I saw her licking the four puppies I started to feel sympathy towards them. ""We didn't know what had happened to her,"" said the woman at the door. ""I took her for a walk one day, soon after the puppies were born, and she just disappeared."" ""She must have tried to come back to them and got lost,"" added a boy from behind her. I must admit I do miss Goldie, but I've got Nugget now, and she looks just like her mother. And I've learnt a good lesson: not to judge people."	['felt worried']
The passage is mainly about _ in Camden.	"Sports, school are tiring. But there is a great way to _ after all of those activities. Go to north London, to the coolest part of the city---Camden. There you can find fashion trends (,) and famous people. Sam and I walked down Camden High Street and made our way to a bridge over Regent's Canal. It is a 9-mile man-made river that goes through London. We went into a big market and saw crazy signs, fun T-shirts, and things like hand-made earrings for sale. We bought Chinese fried noodles. It tasted very different from the noodles we make at home, and we ate it with a fork instead of chopsticks! Camden is famous for the punk style that started in the 1970s. Punks walked around with bright pink and green hair, broken clothes with safety pins, metal buttons and pierced ears and lips. Punk music shops played loud, heavy rock music. But there were also groups of hippies with big sweaters. They sat in cafes drinking soymilk, with black clothes, black lipstick and painted white faces. Besides all these ""normal"" people, a lot of famous people come to Camden. Actor Orlando Bloom from Pirates of the Caribbean lives there. Camden is especially known as a home to famous musicians. Lots of top bands played here, including Coldplay, Oasis---and Sam's favourite band, The Vaccines. I had never heard of them before---But luckily they were playing that night in Camden."

A person with a green thumb is a person _ .	"Green is an important color in nature. It is the color of grass and the leaves on trees. It is also the color of most growing plants. Sometimes, the word ""green"" means young, fresh and growing. For example, a greenhorn is someone who has no experience. In the 15th century, a greenhorn was a young cow or an ox whose horns had not yet developed. A century later, a greenhorn was a soldier who had no experience in war. By the 18th century, a greenhorn had the meaning it has today--a person who is new in a job. Someone who is good at growing plants is said to have a green thumb . The expression comes from the early 20th century. A person with a green thumb can make plants grow quickly and well. Green is also the color used to describe the powerful feeling , jealousy . The green-eyed monster is not a dangerous animal from outer space. It is an expression used about 400 years ago by the British writer William Shakespeare in his play ""Othello"". It describes the unpleasant feeling when someone has something he wants. For example, a young man may suffer from the green-eyed monster if you get a pay rise and he does not. In most places in the world, a green light means to move ahead. In everyday speech, a green light means agree to continue with a project."	['who is good at growing plants']
How did Jenny get her piano?	"When I was four years old, I wanted nothing more in life than to play the piano. My best friend Betty had a piano. But Betty hardly played it at all. She would rather play hide-and-seek. It didn't seem fair. One day my mother came to pick me up from Betty's house. ""Watch this!"" I told her. Then I ran to play a song I had learned that morning. I was so proud of what I'd learned. ""That's nice, Jenny,"" she said. ""But we can't afford a piano."" When I turned six, my mother bought me a recorder . The problem was that I didn't love the recorder. When I played the recorder, I didn't feel anything special inside. I asked my mother if we could have a piano. ""We still can't afford one,"" she said. ""One day, I promise."" In the sixth grade, my mother traded in the recorder for a real clarinet . I like the clarinet more, but it still wasn't a piano. It wasn't the music that was inside of me. One day, when I was in the seventh grade, my mother cut an ad out of the newspaper. We drove to a stranger's home in Providence, Rhode Island. The woman had a beautiful, dark wood piano from Russia. It was called an upright piano because it was tall. It was so shiny that it looked like it was wet. ""We'll take it,"" my mother said. ""It has a nice sound."" After that, I played the piano every single day.When I left for school in the morning, I would leave the sheet music open on the piano. When I got home, I would walk straight to the piano and sit down and start playing the sheet music. I even played if I stayed home sick. I had finally found the music inside of me. Do you struggle with music? Have you been given an instrument to play, but you just can't play it? Maybe you think you're just no good or that you don't have any musical talent. Don't get discouraged. It's not true! We all have music inside of us, even if it's just what we listen to. Now it's up to you to find the right way to set that music free."

From the passage, we know that the writer _ in London.	"""Homestay is a form of study abroad program. It allows the visitor to rent a room from a local family to better understand the local lifestyle. It also helps to improve the visitor's language ability,"" said a teacher during a school meeting last term. ""Students who wish to learn more about foreign cultures or to get foreign experience should join this kind of holiday. I am sure you won't be disappointed."" After this special meeting, I always thought about this kind of holiday. Last month, I had a chance at last to go on such a holiday with some of my schoolmates and we went to London, a place where I had wanted to go since years ago. As we were still young, we had a group leader who planned things for us and looked after us. After we got to London, we went to stay with different families. I was lucky that my host family was a white couple who had a daughter about my age. They treated me as a daughter of their family during my stay there. They were interested in me and I learnt a lot of things from them, too. The holiday was filled with activities every day. After breakfast, a local teacher would come to take us in his car. Then we would have classes or go on a sight-seeing trip to different places of interest like the Big Ben, the London Bridge, and the Buckingham Palace. We would go back to our own homes after the activities. The holiday was a valuable experience for me. I enjoyed every minute of it. Yet, time really flew fast. Three weeks later, we had to leave ""home"" for Hong Kong."	['had a wonderful time']

What lesson can you learn from the passage?	"A famous teacher was speaking to the students at our school. He began his lesson by holding up a PS100 bill. Then he said to the three hundred students, ""Who would like to have this PS100 bill?"" The students began to put up their hands at once. Then he said, ""I am going to give this bill to one of you, but first, let me do this."" He then made this bill into a ball. Then he said, ""Who wants it?"" Hands went into the air. ""Well,"" he said, ""What if I do this?"" and he dropped it on the floor and stepped on it. He picked up the dirty, crumpled bill and said, ""Who still wants it?"" _ ""My friends,"" he said, ""You've learned a valued lesson today. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it didn't go down in value. It was still worth PS100. Many times in our lives, we're dropped, crumpled, and stepped on by the chances we take and the things that happen to us. We feel as if we are worth nothing. But remember, no matter what has happened to you, you will never lose your value. You are always valuable to those who love you. Your value doesn't come from what you drop or whom you know,but WHO YOU ARE . You are special and valuable. Don't ever forget it!"	"[""Your value doesn't change no matter what happens to you.""]"

What common things can tourists learn about at the four interesting places in the passage?	"There is more to tourism in Britain than you might think. When you think of tourist sites in Britain, what do you think of? Big Ben and the Tower of London? Lock Ness? Shakespeare's birthplace at Strafford-upon-Avon? There are many famous tourist attractions in the UK and they attract millions of visitors each year. But along with the famous names there are thousands of other interesting places that are only open to the public for a few days each year. Heritage Open Days takes place each September and lets the public visit places that would normally be out of bounds. Among the thousands of historic sites there are castles and factories, town halls and churches. Here we look at some of the places that most tourists might not know about. Roman Baths --- Chester These Roman baths are almost two thousand years old and a fascinating insight into the history of the city but they aren't often open to visitors because they are under a clothes shop and a shop that sells baked potatoes! In Open Days week, visitors can go downstairs to the basement of the shops and find a little piece of history. Tennis Club --- Birmingham Edgbaston Tennis Club opened in 1860 and is the oldest tennis club in the world. Visitors can see the club's collection of tennis clothes and equipment and learn about the game's rich history. Ardman Animation --- Bristol The studios that produced the famous Wallace and Gromit animated films open its doors to the public to let people find out more about how the films are made. Paddock Wood --- Kent A family house where some of the rooms are unchanged since the 1920s. The home's owner, Sarah Hamilton, is happy to open her doors to the public, saying ""I'm passionate about history and I love taking to people."" These are just a few of the thousands of places to visit each year. If you're visiting Britain in September ---- look out for Open Days!"	['History.']
The word 'hot' (Para. 7) most probably means	"CHICAGO (AP) On Jan. l,an order went into effect requiring that every checked bag at more than 400 of the nation's commercial airports be screened for bombs and weapons. Sunday was expected to the heaviest travel day since Jan. l. Yet spot checks on Sunday at several of the nation's airports showed no major delays caused by the new security measures. At the international terminal for Northwest Airlines at John F. Kennedy International Airport inprefix = st1 /New York, passengers waited up to 30 minutes longer than usual. Their bags were sent through giant screening machines and workers tore open taped boxes and searched through their contents before closing them up again. Most travelers simply accepted stricter screening developed since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11,2001,before which only 5 percent of the roughly 2 million bags checked each day were screened for bombs. The U. S. government has put an additional 23,000 people into airports to carry out the new order. Sonny Salgatar, a 23-year-old college student flying home to San Diego fromChicago, was told by an airport officer after the first pass that one of his bags was ""hot"", meaning there was something he couldn't identify and he wanted to open the bag for an inspection. The ""hot"" item turned out to be Salgatar's clothing iron. ""Listen, anything they want to do for security is OK for me,"" Salgatar said. But not all of the passengers hold the same viewpoint as Salgatar's, complaining that they had to arrive at the airport too much time ahead of their schedule."	['suspicious']
According to the passage, the reason why no two people really read the same newspaper is that _ .	A good modern newspaper is an extraordinary piece of reading. It is remarkable first for what it contains: the range of news from local crime to international politics, from sport to business to fashion to science, and the range of comment and special features as well, from editorial page to feature articles and interviews to criticism of books, art, theatre and music. A newspaper is even more remarkable for the way one reads it: never completely, never straight through, but always by jumping from here to there, in and out glancing at one piece, reading another article all the way through, reading just a few paragraghs of the next. A good modern newspaper offers a variety to attract many different readers, but far from one reader is interested in what brings this variety together in. One place is its topicality , its immediate relation to what is happening in your world and your locality now. But immediacy and the speed of production that goes with it mean also that much of what appears in a newspaper has no more than transient value. For all these reasons, no two people really read the same paper: what each person does is to put together out of the pages of that day's paper, his own selection and sequence, his own newspaper. For all these reasons, reading newspapers efficiently, which means getting what you want from them without missing things you need but without wasting time, demands skill and self-awareness as you modify and apply the techniques of reading.

What is the passage mainly about?	Almost every day we come across situations in which we have to make decisions one way or another. Choice, we are given to believe, is a right. But for a good many people in the world, in rich and poor countries, choice is a luxury, something wonderful but hard to get, not a right. And for those who think they are exercising their right to make choices, the whole system is merely an illusion, a false idea created by companies and advertisers hoping to sell their products. The endless choice gives birth to anxiety in people's life. Buying something as basic as a coffee pot is not exactly simple. Easy access to a wide range of everyday goods leads to a sense of powerlessness in many people, ending in the shopper giving up and walking away, or just buying an unsuitable item that is not really wanted. Recent studies in England have shown that many electrical goods bought in almost every family are not really needed. More difficult decision-making is then either avoided or trusted into the hands of the professionals, lifestyle instructors, or advisors. It is not just the availability of the goods that is the problem, but the speed with which new types of products come on the market. Advances in design and production help quicken the process. Products also need to have a short lifespan so that the public can be persuaded to replace them within a short time. The typical example is computers, which are almost out-of-date once they are bought. This indeed makes selection a problem. Gone are the days when one could just walk with ease into a shop and buy one thing: no choice, no anxiety.	['The helplessness in purchasing decisions.']

Those are the events which happened between 1455 and 1517 EXCEPT _ .	The Knowledge Society According to American economist Peter Drucker, every few hundred years in Western history a sharp transformation takes place in which society rearranges itself. One such period happened between 1455 and 1517, beginning with the invention of the printing press, and included the Renaissance, the European discovery of America, a reawakening of science, and the Protestant Reformation. All these events had significant effects on the development of Western society. The next period lasted from the American Revolution and the Perfection of the steam engine in 1776 until Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815. During this time, the Industrial Revolution took place, public schools systems were established on a large scale, the first modern university was founded in Berlin in 1809, and both capitalism and communism emerged as economic and political ideologies. Again, society had been altered.Drucker suggested that another services to them.	['the Industrial Revolution']

How did the psychologists study and rate the learning strategies?	"In a world as fast-changing and full of information as our own, all of us need to know how to learn well. Yet evidence suggests that most of us don't use the learning techniques that science has proved the most effective. The scientific literature evaluating these techniques goes back to decades and across thousands of articles. It's far too _ and complex for the average parent, teacher or employer to look through. Fortunately, a team of five leading psychologists have done the job for us. Professor John Dunlosky and other psychologists closely examined 10 learning strategies and rated each from high to low utility on the basis of the evidence they've gathered. Here's part of their conclusions: In contrast to familiar practices, the effective learning strategies with the most evidence to support them aren't well known outside the lab. Take distributed practice, for example. This strategy involves spreading out your study time, rather than engaging in one marathon. Cramming information at the last minute may allow you to get through that test or meeting, but the material will quickly disappear from your memory. It's much more effective to look through the material at intervals over time. And the longer you want to remember the information, whether it's two weeks or two years, the longer the intervals should be. The second learning strategy that is highly recommended by Dunlosky is practice testing. Yes, more tests---but there not for a grade. Research shows that the mere act of calling information to mind strengthens that knowledge and aids in future retrieval . While practice testing is not a common strategy---despite the strong evidence supporting it ---there is one familiar approach that captures its benefits: using flash cards. And now flash cards can be presented in digital form. Both distributed practice and practice testing were rated as having ""high utility"" by Dunlosky."

What does the author want to tell us in the text?	"Maricel Apatan, 22, stands in the kitchen of the Edsa Shangi-La Hotel in Manila, preparing to decorate a cheesecake. It would seem to be a routine task for a cake chef, but Maricel is no ordinary chef -- she has no hands. Maricel has come a long way since the day in September 2000 when she and her uncle were attacked near their farm. Fortunately, both of them survived, but the 11-year-old girl lost her hands. In 2004, she entered a Manila training centre for people with disabilities. She learned how to write and do housework and, more importantly, came to terms with her disability. After graduation from high school, she took a two-year Hotel and Restaurant course and _ even though she was the only disabled student in the course. After she moved back to Manila to continue her studies, the media started reporting on this determined young woman. She didn't shy away from the attention.

What was Ole Bull's attitude towards the critic's article?	"Ole Bull was a very famous violinist from Norway. He really liked to play the violin. But his father thought that playing the violin was not useful. So his father sent him to university to study. However, playing the violin was his dream. He didn't want to give up his dream. So he left university before he finished his studies and spent all his time and energy practicing the violin. Unfortunately, his violin teacher was not very good. So when it was time for him to start his concert tour, he still couldn't play the violin very well. Therefore, a Milan newspaper critic1criticized him and said that he was an untrained violinist. The critic said, "" _ 2yet."" When facing this kind of problem, some people may become very angry and some people try to learn from it. Fortunately, Ole Bull belonged to the second group. He went to the newspaper office and found the critic. Instead of being angry, he talked about his mistakes with the man and listened to the man's advice. After he met the critic, he gave up the rest of his concerts. Then he went back to practice the violin with the help of good teachers. In the end, he got great success when he was only 26. He also became one of the most famous violinists in the world."	['Modest.']

Science fiction is called a literary subgenre because _ .	Many people seem to think that science fiction is typified by the Bug-eyed Monster, embodying every feature that most people find unpleasant. This is unfortunate because it degrades a worthwhile literary endeavor. Instead, the basic interest of science fiction lies in the relation between man and his technology and between man and the universe. Science fiction is a literature of change and a literature of the future, and the aspects of human life that it considers make it well worth reading and studying for no other literary form does quite the same things. What is science fiction? To begin, the following definition should be helpful: science fiction is a literary subgenre which postulates(...) a change (for human beings) from conditions as we know them and follows the implications of these changes to a conclusion. The first point that science fiction is a literary subgenre is a very important one, but one which is often overlooked. Specifically, science fiction is either a short story or a novel. There are only a few dramas which could be called science fiction; the body of poetry that might be labeled science fiction is only slightly larger. To say that science fiction is a subgenre of prose fiction is to say that it has all the basic characteristics and serves the same basic functions in much the same way as prose fiction in general, that is, it shares a great deal with all other novels and short stories. Everything that can be said about prose fiction, in general, applies to science fiction. Every piece of science fiction, whether short story or novel, must have a narrator, a story, a plot, characters, setting, and language. The themes of science fiction are concerned with interpreting man's nature and experience around him. Themes in science fiction are constructed and presented in exactly the same ways that themes are dealt with in any other kind of fiction. They are the result to a particular combination of a narrator, story, plot, character, setting, and language. In short, the reasons for reading and enjoying science fiction, and the ways of studying and analyzing it, are basically the same as they would be for any other story or novel.

What would be the best title for the passage?	"Some people believe that a Robin Hood is at work, others that a wealthy person simply wants to distribute his or her fortune before dying. But the donator who started sending envelopes with cash to deserving causes,accompanied by an article from the local paper, has made a northern German city believe in fairytales The first envelope was sent to a victim support group. It contained EUR10,000 with a cutting from the Braunschtveiger Zeitung about how the group supported a woman who was robbed of her handbag; similar plain white anonymous envelopes, each containing EUR10,000, then arrived at a kindergarten and a church. The envelopes keep coming, and so far at least EUR190,000 has been distributed. Last month, one of them was sent to the newspaper's own office. It came after a story it published about Tom, a 14-year-old boy who was severely disabled in a swimming accident. The receptionist at the Braunschweiger Zeitung opened an anonymous white envelope to find 20 notes of EUR500 inside , with a copy of the article. The name of the family was underlined. ""I was driving when I heard the news,"" Claudia Neumann, the boy's mother, told DerSpiegel magazine. ""I had to park on the side of the road; I was speechless. "" The money will be used to make the entrance to their house wheelchair-accessible .and for a course of treatment that their insurance company refused to pay for. ""For someone to act so selflessly, for this to happen in such a society in which everyone thinks of himself, was astonishing,"" Mrs. Neumann said. Her family wonder whether the donator is a Robin Hood character, taking from banks to give to the needy. Henning Noske, the editor of the Braunschweiger Zeitung, said: ""Maybe it is an old person who is about to die. We just do not know. "" However, he has told his reporters not to look for the city's hero, for fear that discovery may stop the donations."	['Unknown Hero Spreads Love in Envelopes']

If a child's musical ability is not recognized, _ .	"How to deal successfully with a child who shows outstanding musical ability?It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage his gift.Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their children's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour.And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are specially able in academic subjects,the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school--especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity.Such children may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction.They aim to provide an environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians. Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities,for example,individual lessons,orchestras,chamber groups,voice training,conducting and theory.They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms,sometimes with a teacher.The rest of their time is taken up with the subjects:English,maths,basic sciences and languages.All five British specialist schools are independent,classes are small by normal school standards,with a high teacher/pupil ratio .Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders,leaving home to live,eat and sleep fulltime at school. What are the disadvantages?An obvious problem is the cost;the fees are high(PS12,000PS17,000 a year for boarders).However,each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance,to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees.Secondly,not all parents want to send their children to boarding school,especially at a very early age.Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such an intense and disciplined environment.They stress,however,that their main aim is to turn out ""rounded and wellbalanced"" individuals. There is little doubt that setting musically gifted children apart from an early age can cause stress.Early signs of musical ability may disappear in their teenage years,while natural competitiveness and the pressure to succeed can lead to a deep sense of failure.But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils,and offer help and advice if needed."

What kinds of clothes are the children wearing when Mr Brown sees them?	"One day Mr Brown sees a young woman with several children in the street. He is very surprised because all the children are wearing the same clothes. White caps, blue coats and yellow trousers. ""Are all these children yours?"" he asks the woman. ""Yes, they are,"" she answers. ""Do you always dress them in the same clothes? "" asks Mr Brown. ""Yes,"" answers the mother. ""When we have four children, we dress them in the same clothes because we don't want to lose any of them. It is easy to see our children among other children because they are all wearing the same clothes. And now we have ten, we dress them like this because we don't want to take other children home by mistake . When there are other children among ours, it is easy to see them because their clothes are different."""	['White caps, blue coats and yellow trousers.']
The story of Bill Clinton is used to _ .	"When former American President Bill Clinton traveled to South Korea to visit President Kim Young Sam, he repeatedly referred to the Korean president's wife as Mrs. Kim. By mistake, President Clinton's advisers thought that Koreans have the same naming customs as the Japanese. Clinton had not been told that, in Korea, wives keep their family names. President Kim Young Sam's wife was named Sohm Myong Suk. Therefore, she should be addressed as Mrs. Sohm. President Clinton arrived in Korea directly after leaving Japan and had not changed his culture _ . His failure to follow Korean customs gave the impression that Korea was not as important to him as Japan. In addition to Koreans some Asian husbands and wives do not share the same family names. This practice often puzzles English-speaking teachers when talking with a pupil's parents. They become puzzled about the student's correct last name. Placing the family name first is common among a number of Asian cultures. Mexican naming customs are different as well. When a woman marries, she keeps her family name and adds her husband's name after the word ""de"", which means ""of"". This affects how they fill in forms in the United States. When requested to fill in a middle name, they generally write the father's family name. But Mexicans are addressed by the family name of the mother. This often causes puzzlement. Here are a few ways to deal with such difficult situations: don't always think that a married woman uses her husband's last name. Remember that in many Asian cultures, the order of first and last names is reversed . Ask which name a person would prefer to use. If the name is difficult to pronounce, admit it, and ask the person to help you say it correctly."	['introduce the topic of the text']
What can we know about Dennis and Martin?	"Do you want to spend a holiday in space? Dennis Tito, a businessman, has become the world's first ""space tourist"". He went on a 10-day visit to the International Space Station. He paid 14 million pounds for his journey. A year later, Martin, a musician from an American band, wanted to do the same. He was only 22 years old and probably very rich too. He had to go for a lot of training to see whether he was fit enough to travel. He is still waiting for his holiday of a lifetime. Many people believe that this is only the start of something new. We made interviews among teenagers from around the world and the following is what they said about space travel. ""It's a great idea. I hope space travel will be common in about 50 years' time. I'd really love to do it and I think Mr. Tito was very lucky."" (Kate from Australia) ""I would like to see our beautiful Earth from space. There are lots of secrets to explore in space and I would go into space if I could."" (Ben from China) ""I think space travel is really bad for the environment. Maybe in the future they will make a cleaner way of travelling but until they do, I don't want to go. We should look after our own planet first.""(Richard from Canada) ""It must be very boring and dangerous to sit in that small space shuttle . I'd rather take a plane and go to another place on earth."" (Lisa from the UK) So, as you can see, many of our teenagers had different opinions. Whether you like it or not, space travel is going to become an important thing in the future. We are looking forward to hearing your opinions."	['Martin was a musician from an American band.']

What caused the lack of statistically significant reduction in the overweight and obese group?	"Eating at a slow speed may help reduce hunger, the U.S. researchers said on Monday. Previous research suggests that the ability to control energy intake may be affected by the speed at which we eat, and a high eating rate may damage the relationship between the sensory signals and processes that control how much we eat. In order to learn more about the link between eating speed and energy intake, researchers examined how eating speed affects calories consumed during a meal in both normal-weight subjects as well as overweight or obese subjects. In the new study, a group of normal-weight subjects and a group of overweight or obese subjects were asked to consume two meals in a controlled environment. All subjects ate one meal slowly, took small bites, chewed thoroughly, and paused and put the spoon down between bites, and ate a second meal quickly, took large bites, chewed quickly, and did not pause and put the spoon down. At the conclusion of the study, the researchers found only normal-weight subjects had a statistically significant reduction in caloric consumption by eating slowly. ""A lack of statistical significance in the overweight and obese group may be partly due to the fact that they consumed less food during both eating conditions compared to the normal-weight subjects,"" Professor Meena Shah said, ""it is possible that the overweight and obese subjects felt more self-conscious, and thus ate less during the study."" Despite the differences in caloric consumption between the normal-weight and overweight and obese subjects, the study found some similarities. Both groups felt less hungry later on after the slow meal than after the fast meal, which indicates that greater hunger suppression among both groups could be expected from a meal consumed more slowly. Also, both the normal-weight and overweight or obese groups consumed more water during the slow meal. ""The higher water intake during the slow eating condition may have affected food consumption,"" said Shah. According to Shah, slowing the speed of eating may help suppress hunger levels and ""may even improve the enjoyment of a meal"". The findings were published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics."	['They ate less food on purpose.']
When Merlin reached the examining room, _ .	"The phone ID flashed, ""Emergency Vet"". ""Oh no"" I whispered. I could not lose Merlin now. Ron and I had tried to have children for a long time with depressing results. I threw myself into my work. Any maternal feelings I had were spent on Merlin. I couldn't wait to get home from work each night. I wanted to pick up that warm bundle of loving fur and nestle him. I wanted to sing ""Rock-a-bye Merlin"", as I did every night as he would put his paws around my neck. Merlin was my comfort especially at times when I wondered if God was listening. But last night something had changed. Not only did I sing ""Rock-a-Bye Merlin"", but I asked, ""What will I do after you're gone?"" Although Merlin was 19 years old, a senior in the age of a cat, he didn't look or act that way. I didn't want to accept the fact that he was nearing the end of his lifetime. My job at the law firm was so demanding and stressful that I couldn't imagine getting through the day without Merlin waiting to greet me at home. I dialed the vet's number. I asked for my husband but he already left. Then I took a breath and asked the question that no one wants to ask, ""Is my Merlin still alive?"" The nurse said ""yes."" Ron came home and said that Merlin had almost no red blood cells left. White blood cells were replacing them. Merlin would need expensive transfusions most likely on a monthly basis. We both knew Merlin was running out of time. I asked Ron to drive me to the vet so I could say goodbye to my little boy cat but he was beat tired and it was late. Ron said if Merlin was still alive the next morning then he would take me to the vet. _ Merlin had survived the night. After driving to the vet, I went into the examining room. The nurse brought Merlin and placed him on an examining table on his side. His eyes were tightly shut. I thought he died already. I carefully edged my hand to reach his body. His body felt warm, but when I spoke his name there was no response. No response to his name or that I was there and that I loved him. I was extremely sad. In that examining room I felt helpless. I wondered how many people in an examining room felt as helpless as I did. Feeling driven to prayer I yelled, ""God this isn't good enough. I need to see my Merlin the way I remember him, I need a miracle and I need it now!"" At that moment, God granted a miracle. Merlin's favorite compliment entered my mind. I said, ""Merlin, You are Beautiful and You are Gorgeous, do you hear me?"" One eye opened. I said ""Gotcha"". I kept repeating those words. Merlin opened the other eye and, one limb at a time, got up. He was waiting for that phrase. He wanted to hear that he was beautiful and gorgeous again. Then I experienced another miracle. There was no sound in that examining room until Merlin started walking to me. From out of nowhere, or maybe from heaven, I clearly heard a song we sung in church often: ""It Is Well With My Soul."" I remembered thinking, ""Yes, it is well with my Soul. I got to see my little boy cat one more time."" Merlin walked to me. He put his face in mine, which he had never done before. He rubbed a circle around my face twice. Merlin said goodbye with his face and marked me for life. Ron appeared shocked that Merlin was up and had walked to me. I said to Merlin, ""Tell God you are a good boy and how much we love you"" and then handed him back to the nurse. Tears of gratitude poured forth in memory of a miracle. You see for nineteen years God spoke to me through a special cat named ""Merlin."" On Merlin's last day, God proved he heard me when he granted a miracle. That miracle gave me time to say goodbye."

Why did the woman say Chihuahuas are a kind of fox?	"""You know, Chihuahuas aren't actual dogs. They're a kind of fox,"" announced a woman at a party. This woman entirely believed that Chihuahuas are the descendants of the Fennec fox. Many people might believe this: Chihuahuas are similar to foxes in their appearance with long-haired Chihuahuas appearing almost indistinguishable from their wild counterparts . The idea that Chihuahuas are related to foxes isn't uncommon. Even the American Kennel Club, which is usually a highly respected source of information, accepts the belief and the similarity between Chihuahuas and Fennec foxes. Interesting as it is to imagine that Chihuahuas are a breed of the fox, this idea simply can't hold water. Chihuahuas are, in fact, far more closely related to dingoes or wolves than they are to Fennec foxes. Like other dogs, Chihuahuas are able to breed with other members within the same species. The Fennec fox is a member of a different species. Chihuahuas and Fennec foxes are fairly distantly related just like a cat and a tiger are. Their similarities occur only because of a phenomenon known as convergent evolution , in which animals develop similar features to meet similar biological needs. A simple observation of geography further denies the idea that Fennec foxes and Chihuahuas are related. While the Fennec fox was living in the deserts of Africa, the Chihuahua came from Mexico, where it got its common name. Its closest living s are other native Central and South American breeds. Its ancestor, the now nearly-extinct Mexican gray wolf, is also a much closer to the Chihuahua than any other fox. It is common to consider the cute Chihuahua as a little Fennec fox adapted to life, but this theory is not true. Chihuahuas are domestic dogs to the same degree as other dogs. Much as a Chihuahua might look like a fox, it is--and always will be--a dog."	['They partly have the features of foxes in appearance.']
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	Balzac was good at buying things at its lowest price. One day he wanted to buy a vase in a shop window that was much more expensive than he could offer. Not being able to make the shopkeeper cut down its price very much, he left without further talking. Collecting a half dozen of his friends, he explained his wish to them and they worked a plan. The first would enter the shop and make an offer, lower than the marked price. Not getting the vase at his price, he would walk out. Shortly after another would enter and ask for a price lower than the first. In this way, each of the others would offer a price lower than the one before, and the last of his friends made a great effort to attempt to get it at the lowest price. Before long Balzac himself would return, offer more than the last two or three persons made and trust to luck. The plan worked--- Balzac got the vase at his price!	['At first the price of the vase was much higher than Balzac could offer.']
Language teachers find it useful because _ .	"Googlefight is a simple service available on the Internet which offers you the chance to compare two different items and see how many hits they get on the Google search engine. The seemingly simple device has proved invaluable to users, especially to help win arguments. For example, imagine that you and your friends are arguing about who are the most popular music or movie stars, you can decide the argument by writing the names in the Googlefight boxes. Let's say that you are arguing about Jackie Chan and Jet Li. You will quickly discover that Jet Li is mentioned 16 million times on Google pages, whereas Jackie Chan is mentioned a mere 12 million times! In this unscientific way, you can claim victory for one Star over another. But teachers have come up with ways of using Googlefight which are much more useful from an academic point of view, particularly when it comes to studying languages. You can, for example, find out the frequency of two words with the same meaning, and deduce from the answers which one is more common. For example, let's take the words ""buy"" and ""purchase"", which mean the same thing (although ""buy"" is only a verb and ""purchase"" is both a verb and a noun). It is immediately clear from Googlefight that ""buy"" is much more commonly used, with a massive three and a half billion hits, compared to only one billion occurrences for the more formal word. But the real value of Googlefight to the language learner is in determining which is the more common of two phrases. For example, ""raining cats and dogs"" is an old-fashioned English expression about the weather. Do English speakers still use it? Or are they more likely to say ""pouring down""? Googlefight suggests the latter. ""Pouring down"" has 898,000 Google hits, whereas ""raining cats and dogs"" only has 326,000. With phrases, it's important to remember that you need to use quote marks to make the search more accurate. For example, if you type in the similar phrases ""look after"" and ""take care of "" without quote marks, the second phrase seems to be more common, but with quote marks, the result is reversed."

What was the turning point in the author's teaching career?	"Last week, on a flight to Washington, I met a confident businessman who asked me about my profession when sitting himself down comfortably next to me. I told him that I am an educator, and for twelve years I have been trying to develop and promote critical thinking about learning in mainstream education. ""Goodness, it must be the most difficult task in the world!"" He thought for a moment. ""Why do you do this?"" I talked about how I had started teaching geography. I told him about the struggles of being a headmaster. And then I told him what I have come to regard as my real turning-point experience. It was back in 1984, when I visited what was known at the time as one of the most outstanding high schools on the Eastern seaboard. After two days there I was totally amazed. I had never met such a fine collection of young people, every one of them apparently confident, enthusiastic, sensitive and well able to manage their futures. I asked the principal how this had been achieved and he smiled. ""We believe in functional literacy for all young people; that is, the ability to feel confident that you can handle the challenges of modern society. That confidence comes when you know that you are able to manage your own learning and will be able to handle that throughout a lifetime. And that,"" he concluded, ""requires the highest possible skills in thinking, communicating, collaborating and decision-making."" ""But, for goodness' sake, those are just the skills I'm looking for among my employees,"" exclaimed my companion. ""That's just what industry has been trying to tell the academic world for years. Instead of listening, you continue to perpetuate a set of practices which are opposite to those very skills needed in employment. You teachers think that life is about working alone on some piece of academic research in an ivory tower different from the daily routines. You just don't understand about working with confusion, nor do you accept the importance of rule-of-thumb calculations or even simple guesswork! This is the real world. There are real issues. What are you or anyone else going to do about just that?"""	['His visit to a high school on the Eastern seaboard.']
We may learn from the passage that _	Transportation and communication networks bring people together. Yet sometimes people themselves create barriers to transportation and communication. In some countries, laws stop people from moving freely from place to place. Over the centuries, many groups of people have been denied the freedom to travel because of their race, religion, or nationality. In the Middle Ages, for example, Jews were often forbidden to move about freely within certain cities. South Africa's government used to require black Africans to carry passes when they travel within the country. Some governments require all citizens to carry identification papers and to report to government officials whenever they move. Countries set up Customs posts at their borders. Foreign travellers must go through a Customs inspection before they are allowed to travel in the country. Usually travellers have to carry special papers such as passports and visas . Some countries even limit the number of visitors to their country each year. Others allow tourists to visit only certain areas of the country, or they may require that travellers be with an official guide at all times during their stay. Many of those barriers to travel also act as barriers to communication. When two governments disagree with each other on important matters, they usually do not want their citizens to exchange news or ideas freely. Countries often try to keep military or industrial information secret. Today, people have the ability to travel, to communicate, and to transport goods more quickly and easily than ever before. Natural barriers that were difficult or dangerous to cross a hundred years ago can now be crossed easily. The barriers that people themselves make are not so easy to overcome. But in spite of all the different kinds of barriers, people continue to enjoy travel and the exchange of goods and ideas.	['man-made barriers are sometimes harder to overcome than natural ones']
The genre of the passage can best be described as a _ .	"I was fortunate enough to discover my love for flying when I was very young. Lucky that some things went my way: my eyesight, for example, was good enough to allow me to become a fighter pilot. And lucky that when I left the army, I found work as an airline pilot, when such jobs weren't plentiful. I still feel lucky, after all these years, to be able to follow my passion. The airline industry has its problems, and a lot of them can be troubling, but I still find purpose and satisfaction in flying. There's some freedom you feel when you're flying above the surface of the earth, no longer limited by gravity. Even at a thousand feet, you get a wider perspective. Problems that seem large down below feel smaller from that height, and smaller still by the time you reach thirty-five thousand feet. I love that flying is an intellectual challenge. If you change the angle of the nose by even one degree while traveling at a typical commercial airliner speed of seven miles a minute, it's enough to increase or decrease your rate of climb or descent by seven hundred feet per minute. I enjoy keeping track of all the calculations, staying aware of the weather conditions, working with a team while knowing closely what the plane can and cannot do. I like the challenge of that. I also like sharing my passion for flying. It's a disappointment to me that a lot of kids today aren't fascinated by flight. I've watched countless children walk past the plane without paying much attention; they're too focused on their video games or their iPods. When there are children who eagerly want a look inside ""my office"" at the front of the plane, it's so rewarding to see their excitement about something I care deeply about. If we aren't busy during boarding, the first officer and I enjoy inviting curious children to sit in our seats in the cockpit , ask questions, and let their parents take photos of them wearing a captain's hat. Being a pilot has a tangible end result that is beneficial to society. It feels good to take a planeload of 183 people where they need or want to go. My job is to reunite people with family and friends, to send them on vacations, to bring them to loved ones' funerals, to get them to their job interviews.

We can conclude from the article that _ .	"Do you often feel lonely? What do you do when you feel that way? Hide yourself away and spend your time reading, watching TV or walking around? You might think that feeling lonely is just like feeling happy, sad or scared -- that it's just one of your various moods. That is true. However, if you let yourself be lonely for too long without dealing with it, you could be making a serious mistake. Doctors have known for some time that feeling lonely is bad for the mind. It can lead to mental health problems such as depression, stress and reduce confidence. ""Being lonely means not feeling connected or cared for, but it's not about being mentally alone,"" Lisa Jaremka, scientist from Ohio State University, US, told Live Science in January. And there's growing evidence that not having friends is connected with physical illness as well. In 2006, for example, scientists studied 2,800 women who had cancer. They found that those who had few friends or family were five times more likely to die of their disease than women with many social contacts. Also, even healthy people had a better chance of falling ill if they felt left out by others, according to the BBC. The results have scientists thinking that loneliness might hurt the immune system , which protects the body from diseases. Hoping to prove this theory, Jaremka and her research team put volunteers through a stress test. During the test, volunteers were asked to make an unprepared speech in front of a group of stony-faced people. The researchers found that volunteers who said they were lonely in their daily lives felt more stress during the test. And their blood samples showed that all the stress had managed to cause harmful changes to their immune system. ""Loneliness has been thought of in many ways as a chronic stressor -- a socially painful situation that can last for quite a long time, "" explained Jaremka, who led the study. The number of people suffering from loneliness is increasing all over the world. However, solving the problem is easier said than done. It won't work to just ""tell anyone to go out and find someone to love you"", said Jaremka. ""We need to create support networks."""	['much more work needs to be done to fight loneliness']
Robert came out in a hurry because _ .	"Several years ago Robert knew a girl at a party. He loved her at once. But he hadn't enough money to marry her. He went to another village and wanted to borrow five thousand dollars from Peter, one of his classmates. He said he was going to return the money in two years. Peter Black believed him and lent the money to him. And Robert thanked the young man very much. In the past four years Robert married the girl and she had a baby. They lived a happy life, but he didn't give the money back to Peter. One day Peter's mother was ill and needed an operation. He looked for Robert for a few times, but he never met him. One day Peter heard that the young man was in. He hurried there. He knocked at the door for a long time and Robert's wife came out to meet him. ""I'm sorry, Mr. Black."" said the woman. ""My husband has just gone out."" Peter thought for a while and said, ""Yes, I met him on my way here. He told me that he had left all his money at home and let you return it to me."" ""Don't believe him, dear!"" Robert came out in a hurry and called out. ""I've never told him about it!"""	['he was afraid his wife would give the money to Peter']

What is the author's attitude to the incident?	"A victim of climate change A polar bear's dead body found on the Arctic island of Svalbard, the northernmost part of Norway, has shocked experts who say climate change may be to blame for the death. The starved polar bear in Norway was said to be in good bones by the time a group of explorers came across its body in July. The bear is thought to have been heading north in a desperate search for sea ice that would allow it to hunt for seals.""From his lying position in death, the bear appears to simply have starved to health in April when the Norwegian Polar Institute examined and labeled it. However, the animal was reduced to skin and bones and died where he dropped,"" polar bear expert Dr. Ian Stirling, a professor at the University of Alberta said, ""He had external suggestion of any remaining fat, having been reduced to little more than skin and bone."" Stirling believes the bear starved to death as a result of a lack of sea ice which the animals use as a platform for hunting seals. That may also explain why the 16-year-old male bear was found about 155 miles north of where it was seen in April. Arctic sea ice reached a record low in 2012, according to a report released this week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that pointed to continued signs of climate change. The International Union for Conservation of Nature currently classifies polar bears as _ e on its Red List of Threatened Species."	['Concerned.']
"By ""Your past is more complete than mine,"" Mommy means _"	"Dear Maya Shao-ming, To me, June 6, 1990 is a special day. My long-awaited dream came true the minute your father cried, ""A girl!"" You are more than just a second child, more than just a girl to match our boy. You, little daughter, are the link to our female line, the legacy of another woman's pain and sacrifice 31 years ago. Let me tell you about your Chinese grandmother. Somewhere in Hong Kong, in the late fifties, a young waitress found herself pregnant by a cook, probably a co-worker at her restaurant. She carried the baby to term, suffered to give it birth, and kept the little girl for the first three months of her life. I like to think that my mother--your grandmother--loved me and fought to raise me on her own, but that the daily struggle was too hard. Worn down by the demands of the new baby and perhaps the constant threat of starvation, she made the painful decision to give away her girl so that both of us might have a chance for a better life. More likely, I was dropped at the orphanage (M JLR) steps or somewhere else. I will probably never know the truth. Having a baby in her unmarried state would have brought shame on the family in China, so she probably kept my existence a secret. Once I was out of her life, it was as if I had never been born. And so you and your brother and I are the missing leaves on a family tree. Do they ever wonder if we exist? Before I was two, I was adopted by an Anglo couple. Fed three square meals a day, I grew like a wild weed and grasped all the opportunities they had to offer--books, music, education, church life and community activities. In a family of blue-eyed blonds, though, _ . Whether from jealousy or fear of someone who looked so different, my older brothers sometimes teased me about my unpleasing skin, or made fun of my clumsy walk. Moody and impatient, burdened by fears that none of us realized resulted from my early years of need, I was not an easy child to love. My mother and I conflicted countless times over the years, but gradually came to see one another as real human beings with faults and talents, and as women of strength in our own right. Lacking a mirror image in the mother who raised me, I had to seek my identity as a woman on my own. The Asian American community has helped me regain my double identity. But part of me will always be missing: my beginnings, my personal history, all the delicate details that give a person her origin. Nevertheless, someone gave me a lucky name ""Siu Wai."" ""Siu"" means ""little,"" and ""Wai means ""clever."" Therefore, my baby name was ""Clever little one."" Who chose those words? Who cared enough to note my arrival in the world? I lost my Chinese name for 18 years. It was Americanized for convenience to ""Sue."" But like an ill-fitting coat, it made me uncomfortable. I hated the name. But even more, I hated being Chinese. It took many years to become proud of my Asian origin and work up the courage to take back my birth-name. That, plus a little knowledge of classroom Cantonese, is all the Chinese culture I have to offer you. Not white, certainly, but not really Asian, I try to pave the way between the two worlds and bridge the gap for you. Your name, ""Shao-ming,"" is very much like mine--""Shao"" means ""little."" And ""ming"" is ""bright,"" as in a shining sun or moon. Whose lives will you brighten, little Maya? Your past is more complete than mine, and each day I cradle you in your babyhood, generously giving you the loving care I lacked for my first two years. When I pat you, I comfort the lost baby inside me who still cries for her mother. Sweet Maya, it doesn't matter what you ""become"" later on. You have already fulfilled my wildest dreams. I love you, Mommy"	['Shao-ming has got motherly care and a sense of roots']
What's Chen Jining's attitude towards Chai's film?	"Smog is a big problem in many Chinese cities. But it seems that besides wearing a mask, few of us know what has caused the smog and what to do to beat it. Chai Jing, a former news interviewer with CCTV, discussed the questions in her documentary Under the Dome. The 103-minute film was on websites on Feb 28. In the film, Chai visits polluted places and talks to officials and scientists. She thinks that burning too much coal and oil are the main causes of PM2.5 and smog. To solve the problem, Chai suggests that we should clean our coal and oil or replace them with cleaner energy such as natural gas. In her film, Chai also emphasized that everyone can do something to help control smog too. For example, we can live a greener life by using more public transport. Or if we see things that could harm the environment, we can try to stop it. In the film, when she sees a restaurant cooking without any suitable filter facilities , she calls the hotline 12369. The restaurant installed the filter a week later. Chen Jining, the new minister of environmental protection, praised Chai. ""This film encourages ordinary people to take notice of the environment. This is what we need in the future."""	['He thought highly of it.']
"By saying ""they are hunting ducks"", Ali _ ."	"Something roared like thunder. The earth shook a little and we heard the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire. ""Father!"" Hassan cried. We sprung to our feet and raced out of the living room. ""Father! What's that sound? Hassan screamed, his hands outstretched toward Ali. Ali wrapped his arms around us. A white light flashed and lit the sky in silver. It flashed again and was followed by rapid sharp sounds of gunfire. ""They're hunting ducks."" Ali said in a hoarse voice. ""They hunt ducks at night, you know."" Don't be afraid. A siren went off in the distance. Somewhere glass broke and someone shouted. I heard people on the street, jolted from sleep and probably still in their pajamas, with ruffled hair and puffy eyes. Hassan was crying. Ali pulled him close, clutched him with tenderness. We stayed huddled that way until the early hours of the morning. The shootings and explosions had lasted less than an hour, but they had frightened us badly, because none of us had ever heard gunshots in the streets. They were foreign sounds to us then. The generation of Afghan children whose ears would know nothing but the sounds of bombs and gunfire was not yet born. Huddled together in the dining room and waiting for the sun to rise, none of us had any notion that a way of life had ended. The end came when Russian tanks were rolling into the very same streets where Hassan and I played, bringing the death of the Afghanistan I knew and marking the start of a still ongoing era of bloodletting. Just before sunrise, Baba's car peeled into the driveway. His door slammed shut and his running footsteps pounded the stairs. Then he appeared in the doorway and I saw something on his face. Something I didn't recognize right away because I'd never seen it before: fear. ""Amir! Hassan!"" He cried as he ran to us, opening his arms wide. ""They blocked all the roads and the telephone didn't work. I was so worried!"" We let him wrap us in his arms and, for a brief moment, I was glad about whatever had happened that night."

What mistake did Mr. King make?	"Mr. King was over sixty and lived by himself a long way from town. He nearly hadn't left his home. But one day he went into town to buy things. After he bought them, he went into a restaurant and sat down at a table by himself. When he looked around, he saw several old people put glasses on before they read their newspapers. So after lunch he decided to go to a shop to buy himself a pair of glasses, too. He walked along the street and soon found a shop. The man in the shop helped him try on many pairs of glasses, but Mr. King always said, ""No, I cannot read with them."" The man became more and more puzzled and in the end ha said, ""Excuse me, but can you read?"" ""No, of course not!"" Mr. King said angrily. ""If I can read, why have I come here?"""

Frank sold the odds and ends quickly because _ .	"Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT."""

What's the best title for this passage?	Rembrandt was an extraordinary Dutch painter. He was most well-known for his brushwork and the way in which he connected with the human soul. His life, however, was not happy. He was born on July 15,1606 in Leiden, the Netherlands. His father wanted him to have a real, learned profession but Rembrandt left the University of Leiden after becoming bored. He began studying art under a local teacher but soon left and studied in Amsterdam where he mastered all his lessons in six months! At the age of 22, he moved back to Leiden and began to get his own students. One of his students was the famous artist Gerrit Dou. In 1631 he returned to Amsterdam where he became the most popular portrait painter in Holland. Rembrandt met Saskia and married her in 1634. She was a cousin of a very successful art dealer and she helped him to meet wealhy people who commissioned many paintings from him. He used her as a model in many of his paintings. Rembrandt's private life, however, was very unfortunate. He had four children with Saskia but only one, Titus, survived. Saskia died in 1642 at the age of only 30. In 1649, his housekeeper became his second wife and was also a model for many of his paintings. Even though Rembrandt was very successful as an artist, art dealer and teacher, he lived in a careless way and had to declare bankruptcy in 1656. He even had to sell his whole art collection and his house to pay off his debts. His unfortunate life, however, didn't affect his art. He painted many great paintings during that time. His new love, Hendrickje, died in 1663 and his 27-year-old son, Titus, died in 1668. Eleven months later, on October 4, 1669, Rembrandt died in Amsterdam. He produced more than 600 paintings and over 2,000 drawings!	['A brief biography of Rembrandt']
Which is not mentioned in the passage?	Some advice : (1) Always play in a safe place. A park is a safe place because there are no cars or trucks. But do not talk to anyone you do not know. Never go with a stranger into a motor car. (2) Before crossing the road, stop and look both ways. Look left, look right, look left again. (3) Keep away from houses or building that are being built or knocked down. Something might fall on your head, or you might cut yourself on broken grass. (4) Medicines or pills can be dangerous. Never swallow any pills or medicines you find in the cupboard. (5) Wear a life jacket whenever you go out in a boat. Even if you are not in the open sea and the water is not deep, you should have your life jacket on. It's easy to fall out of a boat. (6) Do not put your head out of a car, bus or train. Many children have been killed by doing this.	['A plane']
What do we learn about Mother?	"From my earlier memory of Mother it somehow seemed quite natural to think of her as different, nor of everyday things as Father was. In those days he was a young-looking man. He did not hesitate to make friends with children as soon as they were able to talk to him and laugh at his stories. Mother was older than he was. She must have been a woman of nearly forty, but she seemed even older. She changed little for a long time, showing no indication of growing old at all until, towards the end of her life, she suddenly became an old lady. I was always _ about Mother's age. She never had birthdays like other people, nor did anyone else in our family. No candles were ever lit or cakes made or presents given in our house. To my friends in the street who talked delightfully about their birthday parties, I would repeat my mother's words that such celebrations were only foolish. ""Nothing but deception,"" she would say. ""As though life can be marked by birthdays. It's deeds, not years, that matter."" Although I often repeated her words and even prided myself on not having birthdays, I once could not help asking Mother when she was born. ""I was born. I'm alive as you can see, so what more do you want to know?"" she replied, so sharply that I never asked her about her age again. In so many other ways Mother was different. Whereas all the rest of the women I knew in the neighboring hoses took pride in their housewifely abilities, their new furniture, the neat appearance of their homes, Mother regarded all those things as of little importance. Our house always looked as if we had just moved in or were about to move out."	['She was special']
Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"What happens when five Chinese teachers take over a British classroom full of teenagers? The experimental program was designed to test how 50 students ages 13 and 14 at the Bohunt School in Hampshire would deal with a completely Chinese teaching method. With long school days and tough rules, it's considered to be ""strict"" to Westerners. It took the BBC six months to choose suitable Chinese teachers. They had to be English, math, science or social science teachers with more than five years teaching experience in China. They also had to be able to teach in English. Though language was not a problem for the Chinese teachers, they weren't used to the difference between Chinese and British students. Li Aiyun from the Nanjing Foreign Language School told British media that when she handed out homework sheets, she expected the students to _ on their homework. ""But when I walked in the classroom, some students were chatting, some students were eating, somebody was even putting make-up on her face. I had to control myself, or I would be crazy. About half of them tried their best to follow me. And the other half ? Who knows what they were doing?"" she said. While Rosie Lunskey, 15, told BBC interviewers that she found it difficult to get used to the Chinese teachers. ""Acting like robots was the right way to go. I'm used to speaking my mind in class, giving ideas, often working in groups to develop my skills and improve my knowledge. But a lot of the time in the experiment, the only thing I felt I was learning was how to copy notes really fast and listen to the teacher, ""she complained."

What do you think happened to the writer?	"The clock struck eleven at night. The whole house was quiet. Everyone was in bed except me. Under the strong light, I looked sadly at a huge pile of those trouble things --books. I was going to have my exam the next day. ""When can I go to bed?"" I asked myself. I didn't answer. And I could not. The clock struck twelve. ""Oh, dear! Ten more books to read before I go to bed!"" We students are the most wretched ones in the world. Dad does not agree with me on this. He did not have to work so hard when he was a boy. The clock struck one. I was quite hopeless now. I forgot all I did learn. I was too tired to go on. I did the only thing I could. I prayed , ""My god, please let me pass the exam tomorrow. I will work hard next time, Amen."" My eyes were so heavy that I could hardly open them. A few minutes later, with my head on the books, I fell asleep."	['He failed in the exam.']
According to the passage, what's the attitude of Mr. Liu towards divorce?	"Soaring divorce rates around the globe are the environment, American researchers suggested in a study released on a Monday. Michigan State University researcher Jianguo ""Jack"" Liu and his assistant Eunice Yu said the increasing number of divorces leads to more households with fewer people and greater consumption of water and energy. They said housing units require space, construction materials and fuel to heat and cool, regardless of the number of inhabitants. For example, in the United States in 2005, divorced households consumed an extra 73 billion kilowatt hours of electricity and 627 billion gallons of water. An additional 38 million extra rooms required heating and lighting that same year due to divorced households. That costs $6.9 billion in extra utility costs per year, Liu said, plus an added $ 3.6 billion for water, in addition to other costs such as land use. ""A married household actually uses resources more efficiently than a divorced household,"" Liu said. He said that in cohabitating household, people will watch the same television, share the air conditioning and heat and use the same refrigerator. All things use energy at a regularly stable rate, regardless of the number of users. Liu said he was not condemning divorce, ""Some people really need to get divorced."" He said cohabitation--whether by a family or friends--was simply a more environmentally friendly option. Additonally, the researchers noted that trends other than divorce are also changing family living structures, such as the end of multiple generations of a family sharing a home and people remaining single longer. ""People's first reaction to this research is surprise, and then it seems simple."" Liu said in a press release. ""But a lot of things become simple after research is done. Our challenges were to connect the dots and quantify their relationships. People have been talking about how to protect the environment and fight against climate change, but divorce is a factor that people don't notice and it needs to be considered"". He said the increasing energy demands caused by divorce should be considered by governments when they are creating environmental policies.

From the passage,we can infer that _	Colorful hair speaks more about beauty. Now it becomes popular and people are dyeing their hair to make it different. Dyeing hair with natural products is good for health while dyeing with chemicals is harmful. Researches have found that dyeing hair with chemicals can make people have cancer. Lead is very harmful for the human body and it is used in most hair dyes. Since the base of hair is the scalp ,you may have allergic reaction . While dyeing your hair it is important to take some safety measures. You can follow them even when you are applying dye on your hair at home. * It is better to apply hair dye for a few minutes. If you leave your hair with dye, longer than the necessary time,then you may get some skin problems. * Don't forget to wear gloves while applying dye on the hair. This will protect the skin of your hands. * After applying hair dye it is important to wash your hair with water. * Hair dyes are made of chemicals. If you mix different hair dyes ,there may be chemical reaction. So, It is not a good idea to mix different hair dyes at the same time. * Finally all the bags of hair dyes carry the directions( ) Try to follow them very carefully. This will lower the chance of allergic reaction.	['amanwhooftendyeshishairmayhavecancer']
The father may agree that _ .	"Dear daughter, As we drove off from Columbia, I wanted to write a letter to you to tell you all that is on my mind. I want to tell you how proud we are. Getting into Columbia is a real testament of what a great well-rounded student you are. Your academic, artistic, and social skills have truly blossomed in the last few years. You have become a talented and accomplished young woman. College will be the most important years in your life. It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about. You often question ""what good is this course"". I encourage you to be inquisitive, but I also want to tell you: ""Education is what you have left after all that is taught is forgotten."" What I mean by that is the materials taught isn't as important as you gaining the ability to learn a new subject, and the ability to analyze a new problem. That is really what learning in college is about - this will be the period where you go from teacher-taught to master-inspired, after which you must become self-learner. So do take each subject seriously, and even if what you learn isn't critical for your life, the skills of learning will be something you cherish forever. Follow your passion in college. Take courses you think you will enjoy. Don't be trapped in what others think or say. Steve Jobs says when you are in college, your passion will create many dots, and later in your life you will connect them. In his great speech given at Stanford commencement, he gave the great example where he took calligraphy, and a decade later, it became the basis of the beautiful Macintosh fonts, which later ignited desktop publishing, and brought wonderful tools like Microsoft Word to our lives. His expedition into calligraphy was a dot, and the Macintosh became the connecting line. Enjoy picking your dots, and be assured one day you will find your calling, and connect a beautiful curve through the dots of yourself . Most importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life, because during college you are closer to them physically than to your family. Also, going through independence and adulthood is a natural bonding experience. So please treasure your college years - make the best of your free time, become an independent thinker in control of your destiny, evolve yourself into a bi-cultural talent, be bold to experiment, learn and grow through your successes and challenges. When I faced the greatest challenge and opportunity in my life in 2005, you gave me a big hug and said ""bonne chance"", which means ""good luck"" and ""good courage"". Now I do the same for you. Bonne chance, my angel and princess. May Columbia become the happiest four years in your life, and may you blossom into just what you dream to be.

Which is not the reason why the author wants to be a teacher?	As is known, it is a respectful job to be a teacher serving students heart and soul. And most people also compare a teacher to a gardener who takes great care of various plants. Ever since my high school days, my heart has been set on becoming a teacher. I am now studying at a teacher's college, and I am making great efforts to study, because there are so many things to learn about education. But I thoroughly enjoy my studies, and every day I am amazed at the great influence education has on the human soul. I think it is only natural that I have always _ to become a teacher because my father and his father were also teachers. My father is now retired, following a brilliant career, and it has always been his dream to have me, his only son, follow in his footsteps. Although it sounds like my father's dream that I will become a teacher, it is also my dream and I am quite willing to realize the dream. I still have one more year to go at university, and after I graduate, I will go to the western part of China to become a teacher at a village school. I understand a teacher's job will not make me a millionaire, but it is not the prospect of making a lot of money that has propelled my ambition to become a teacher. Rather, it is my sincere desire to assume a responsible role in society, and make as many people well--educated as possible through my hard endeavors. Education plays an essential and important role in our society. If everyone can receive a good education, it will not only do good to our country but also benefit individuals' lives. Ten years from now, therefore, I hope to be established as an excellent teacher with hundreds of thousands of students who have benefited from me and carry on the family tradition with efficiency and honour.

The writer suggests that _	Fire fighting is a serous matter, knowing what to do during a fire can save people's lives. It is important to know the ways you can use and show them to everyone else in the family, such as stairways and emergency exits, but not elevators. From the lower floors of building, escape through windows is possible. Learn the best way to get out from a window with the least chance of serious injury. The second floor window is usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging by the fingertips will have a drop of about 6 feet to the ground. It is about twice the height of an average man. Of course, it is safer to jump a short way down than to stay in a burning building. Windows are also useful when you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed before opening the window. Otherwise, smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low at the window to be sure you get fresh air rather than smoke that may have leaked into the room. On the second or third floor, the best windows for escape are those which open onto a roof. From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely. Dropping onto cement might end in injury. Bushes and trees can help you to have a soft landing.	['smoke will enter the room through an open window']

What did people begin to consider as electricity was no longer cheap?	When building houses, people used to think about not only the climate of the areas but also the building materials and the fashions for their houses. However, since electricity became more and more expensive , people began to pay much more attention to the energy they could get for their houses and the new ways they could find to protect their houses from both cold and heat.

During cold weather, they gather their cows, goats, or other animals and keep them on the first floor of their houses. The reasons are that the animals can be protected from the cold and that they can help to heat the houses as well. The body heat given off by the animals rises to the second floor of the houses, where people live. By sharing their houses with their livestock, people gain a source of heat. People who live in or near cities do not usually keep livestock. However, home builders use the fact that heat rises. This _ can be used in building houses in these areas, instead of keeping livestock on the first floor builders fill it with large rocks. As they are open to the sun's rays during cold weather, these rocks take in heat. They also give off the heat, and, of course, the warm air rises into the living areas of the houses. So these houses are energy saving. House building becomes a great challenge to building designers and energy engineer. They try to meet this challenge by learning from old traditions and by using modern technology. And someday in the future, people will be able to live in more energy saving houses.

How did Chen Hongsheng feel about their help to the poor children?	"How was your Children's Day? What kind of gifts did you get? Eight third graders in some poor places in Hebei Province got new schoolbags as Children's Day gifts. They were very happy. There were pencils, pens, exercise books and many other school supplies in the schoolbags. These schoolbags are from students in Beijing Zhongguancun Fourth Primary School. They are in Class 5, Grade 3. They raised money by themselves. They printed out their writings. Their head teacher Mrs Hou helped them to make books. They sold the books at their school to make 800 yuan. Chen Hongsheng, 9 years old, is one of the students. ""We use 800 yuan to buy eight schoolbags at the post office. The post office workers give us a list of the kids. These kids live in poor places. We can choose eight kids by ourselves and post these schoolbags to them,"" she said very proudly. ""These schoolbags are gifts of our class. This summer vacation, I'll send out a schoolbag by myself. I hope the kid with my schoolbag can go to school happily like us in the new term."""	['Proud']
"When the author says ""My father's phone messages were also lessons in patience and long-suffering to a teenage girl."", it means that when she was young _ ."	"I was an extremely verbal child, and growing up with my dad was an experiment in linguistics . My father was a man of few words. Whenever I wanted his permission for a certain activity, I planned a speech that included who would be there, where it would take place, how long it would last, and why it was an incredibly wonderful opportunity for me. He would listen and then say either ""Yes"" or ""No."" There were never any qualifiers; not ""Yes, but be home by dinner"" or ""No, unless you can convince me otherwise."" It was yes or no, plain and simple. My father's phone messages were also lessons in patience and long-suffering to a teenage girl. I was quite active in high school. Not only did I enjoy being involved in many areas, but I came into contact with many a great teenage guy. I can recall one busy day when I had met two great guys and had given each of them my phone number. The first words out of my mouth when I walked through the front door were, ""Dad! Did anyone call?"" His answer, of course, was simply ""Yes"".I required for a more accurate description of the caller. His answer: ""A boy."" Since I had met two guys that day, this did not help me. I ran to my room in tears. Knowing my dad's dislike of language in general and his fondness for briefness, it surprised me to hear that he was going to teach the eleven-year-old boys' Sunday school class. He did so for not one, but many years. I always wondered if he actually said anything, or if they all just sat in their chairs and stared at each other. I was sure that if people were waiting on my father to _ with brilliant conversation or a springboard comment, they'd be badly disappointed. Still, September after September, my father hung his sign outside the Sunday school room: Mr. Ernst--Eleven-Year-Old Boys."

What's the purpose of the text?	Every athlete,from Tiger Woods(a golf player)to a high school quarterback ,uses a form of self-hypnosis to move their game to the next level Use the Olympics to 1earn how to use the amazing power of your subconscious to do the same with your sport. Here are some examples of how to best use the power of the mind: During the 2004 Olympics,one of the swimmers told of how she would fall asleep each night with the picture of a clock in her mind. It was the timer's clock she would see at the end of her Olympic swim and it always had her world-record-breaking time on it. In his pre-shot routine, Tiger Woods never varies the number of practice swings or intensity of his concentration.The pre-shot routine is always the same so that the stroke will always be the same. Michael Phelps,American Swimming Gold Medalist, always stretches out his back and arms by swinging both arms three times before his event. Not 2,not 4: always 3. He is anchoring in his winning state of mind and state of body as well as stretching. In athletics, an anchor is a gesture or series of gestures that put you into the frame-of mind(and body)you want to be in to win.Repetition is what makes it work .That means practice,practice,practice ---- with your body as well as your mind. Begin right now creating a ritual before you exercise.Visualize yourself doing whatever you do faster, longer, higher--whatever adverb works best for your particular activity. Then begin to mentally practice it. See or imagine yourself-----with your ideal body ---- doing your activity better, faster, longer, etc. Using both the power of your brain and the activity of your body, soon you will be better and fitter as you use the Olympics to help you create a happier and healthier you.

What may happen if students chew gum in class?	There are a lot of school rules around the world. For example, in Australia, Canada, Japan and the United States, students have to wear uniforms, and they are not allowed to wear earrings. Some schools in Japan and other countries have rules about hair. For example, students are not allowed to change the color of their hair. In the United States, boys can not have their hair grow long. For safety at some US schools, students must have a pair of indoor shoes at school every day. This makes sure students won't fall over on the wet floors and keeps the schools clean. Gum chewing is not allowed in many US school buildings, as it is difficult to clean up. And if students chew gum in class, they may not pay much attention to their studies. In most foreign countries, school students are allowed to work part-time. But differently, Japanese school students are not allowed to work part-time or change the color of their hair. ,.

Which of the following about Doslu is true?	"If you happen to find ""On the Road"" at a gas station or ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" in your grocery store, it might not be and accident. You could be the unwitting beneficiary of a ""bookcrosser""---- a person who on purpose leaves books in public places hoping they'll be found by strangers. The idea o leaving a book for someone else to find and enjoy is not new ---- some people have been leaving just-finished books in airports and on buses since the dawn of the hurry-up-and-wait. Creating a system for book-leavers to find out what happened to those books adds a new way to the practice. Bokcrossing.com, the website that encourages books to be ""released into the wild"", has more than 18,000 members since its start last year, and averages 112 new participants daily. Its members have scattered more than 42,000 novels, self-help books, memoirs, technical manuals and biographies in 45 countries, leaving them in public restrooms, movie theatres, coffee studios or anywhere that they can imagine. The result: a worldwide living library. Peri Doslu, a California yoga instructor, has dropped three--- one on top of a telephone booth, one on a rock wall at remote Mono Lake in the eastern Sierra Nevada, and another in one of the studios where she teaches.

Which of the following is not a must for the interviewees?	Would you like to join an all-women' s expedition to Annapurna? You must be an experienced high altitude climber, strong, enthusiastic and a hard worker! If you think this is for YOU, please contact: Arlene Blum, Berkeley, California, USA. Many women wrote to them from all over the world, but they could only choose ten. When the final team was chosen, the youngest was twenty years old, the oldest was fifty. For Arlene, finding the climbers was only the first step. The team needed another important thing: money. There were long talks at Vera Watson' s house, when they discussed how to make the 80,000 dollars they would need for the expedition. With the help of enthusiastic friends, they organized dances, sports, and parties. They even sold expedition T- shirts. After many months, and a lot of hard work, they finally had the money they needed. Now at last they were in Kathmandu, the city where their great adventure would begin. Arlene looked round at the women in the airport. They looked tired after the long journey from Francisco, but happy to be in Nepal at last. There had been so many friends and families at the airport to say goodbye. It had been difficult to leave the people they loved. Irene had looked so sad when she said goodbye to her daughters. Arlene had found it very difficult to leave her boyfriend, John. For all of them there was the chance that they would never see their families or friends again. All climbing in the Himalayas is dangerous. One in ten of the people who go there do not come back. Annapurna was very dangerous because of its avalanches. Arlene knew the avalanches very well.

I'm a senior now, and the college admissions process isn't exactly what I dreamt of when I was 7 years old. There are deadlines to meet, majors to choose, and how am I going to pay for all of this ? My mind plays tricks on me, convincing that my roommate will hate me and that my classes will be horribly boring and that each day will begin at five in the morning. To be honest, while I have many reasons to be excited for the next journey in my educational pursuits, I'm also scared to death. I've invested hours upon hours studying for AP tests, SATs and ACTs. My peers and I sacrificed our Friday night football games, school dances and field trips to do better in studies in school. But is it all worth it ? What if the promise of college ends up being disappointing rather than a relief ? In a year from now, my whole life will change. I'll be a legal adult. My dorm might be in Paris, Los Angeles or Chicago. I'll be doing my own laundry, cooking my own food and paying for things on my own. I'll meet entirely new people and say goodbye to others. But isn't that also the joy of life ? I want to experience joy, heartbreak, first times and new adventures. College freaks me out, but you know what scares me more ? I must leave my life inside a comfort zone. It's a big, bright and beautiful world, and I think it's finally time for me to walk in it with the confidence at this time, I'll be doing it right.

What did the author's father think about Stradivarius violins?	When I was a boy, my father told me that he could do anything he wanted to.Dad said that he wanted to be the first to develop color1 prints in our city, and so he did. When I was 16, Dad looked closely at the violin I played and announced that he wanted to make one. He read about violin making, and then became a violinmaker at the age of 43.He bought the tools and materials, opened a small store and set Mom up as the shopkeeper, while he worked at a local company. He retired from the company 17 years later and continued to make violins and other instruments. Dad often guessed why the Stradivarius violins sound so beautiful. Some experts claimed that it was the unique varnish that gave those instruments their beautiful sound. Dad argued that chemists could analyze the varnish--if that were the answer. One of Dad's friends asked him once which kind of wood was used to make violins.When Dad explained that the top was made of spruce , his friend said that he had an old piece of spruce Dad might be interested in. He worked for the next 12 months making a violin from the wood that his friend had given him. It proved to be a superior violin and it would become Dad's masterpiece. He was convinced that the secret of the Stradivarius sound was in the wood itself. Later, the instrument was stolen.Dad's spirit was broken by the robbery, and he stopped making instruments. But he kept the music shop until he was 80 years old, selling guitars and violins. My father has been gone for 14 years now. The violin has been missing for more than 25 years.Somewhere a musician is playing a late 20th century violin with an excellent tone. The owner today may never understand why this ordinary-looking violin sounds so much like a Stradivarius.	['The wood of the violins was special.']
After a child grows up, he _ .	How often one hears children wishing they were grown-ups and old people wishing they were young again. Each age has its pleasures and its pains, and the happiest person is the one who enjoys what each age gives him without wasting his time in useless regrets. Childhood is a time when there are few _ to make life difficult. If a child has good parents, he is fed, looked after and loved, whatever he may do. It is impossible that he will ever again in his life be given so much without having to do anything in return. What's more, life is always presenting new things to the child -- things that have lost their interest for older people because they are too well-known. But a child has his parents. He is not so free to do what he wishes to do; he is continually being told not to do things or being punished for what he has done wrong. When the young man starts to earn his own living, he can no longer expect others to pay for his food, his clothes, and his room, but has to work if he wants to live comfortably. If he spends most of his time playing about in the way that he used to as a child, he will go hungry. And if he breaks the laws of society as he used to break the laws of his parents, he may go to prison. If, however, he works hard, keeps out of trouble and has good health, he can have the great happiness of building up for himself his own position in society.

The example of Johnny shows _ .	"It's rare that you see the words ""shyness"" and ""leader"" in the same sentence. After all, the common viewpoint is that those outgoing and sociable guys make great public speakers and excellent networkers and that those shy people are not. A survey conducted by USA Today referred to 65 percent of executives who believed shyness to be a barrier to leadership. Interestingly, the same article stresses that roughly 40 percent of leaders actually are quite shy--they're just better at adapting themselves to situational demands. Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and Charles Schwab are just a few ""innies"". Unlike their outgoing counterparts who are more sensitive to rewards and risk-taking, shy people take a cautious approach to chance. Rather than the flashy chit-chat that defines social gathering, shy people listen attentively to what others say and absorb it before they speak. They're not thinking about what to say while the other person is still talking, but rather listening so they can learn what to say. Along the same lines, shy people share a common love of learning. They are intrinsically motivated and therefore seek content regardless of achieving an outside standard. Being shy can also bring other benefits. Remember being in school and hearing the same kids contribute, until shy little Johnny, who almost never said a word, cut in? Then what happened? Everyone turned around to look with great respect at little Johnny actually talking. This is how shy people made good use of their power of presence:they ""own"" the moment by speaking calmly and purposefully, which translate to a positive image. Shyness is often related to modesty. Not to say that limelight-seekers aren't modest, but shy people tend to have an accurate sense of their abilities and achievements. As a result, they are able to acknowledge mistakes, imperfections, knowledge gaps and limitations. Since shy people have a lower sensitivity to outside rewards than outgoing ones, they're more comfortable working with little information and sticking to their inner desires. Shy people are also more likely to insist on finding solutions that aren't primarily apparent. Don't believe me? Maybe you'll believe Albert Einstein, who once said, "" _ "" Obviously, finding certainty where uncertainty is typically popular is a huge plus for any successful person. The myth that shy people are less effective leaders than their outgoing fellows is just a misunderstanding. Make wise use of your personality strengths to lead your business no matter what side of the range you fall on."	['shy people may have an advantage in discussion']
Father told the girl that _ .	"Once there was a man who had two children, a boy and a girl. The boy was good-looking but the girl was not.

He went up to them and said to the boy, ""You must always BE good as well as LOOK good.""

We can learn from the passage that _ .	"In winter Hammerfest is a thirty-hour ride by bus from Oslo, though why anyone would want to go there in winter is a question worth considering. It is on the edge of the world, the northernmost town in Europe, as far from London as London is from Tunis, a place of dark and cruel winters, where the sun sinks into the Arctic Ocean in November and does not rise again for ten weeks.I wanted to see the Northern Lights. Also, I had long harboured a half-formed urge to experience what life was like in such a remote and forbidding place. Sitting at home in England with a glass of whisky and a book of maps, this had seemed an excellent idea. But now as I picked my way through the grey, late-December slush of Oslo I was beginning to have my doubts. Things had not started well. I had overslept at the hotel, missing breakfast, and had to leap into my clothes. I couldn't find a cab and had to drag my unreasonably overweighted bag eight blocks through slush to the central bus station. I had had huge difficulty persuading the staff at the Kreditkassen Bank on Karl Johans Gate to cash sufficient traveller's cheques to pay the overcharged 1,200-kroner bus fare-they simply could not be made to grasp that the William McGuire Bryson on my passport and the Bill Bryson on my traveller's cheques were both me-and now here I was arriving at the station two minutes before departure, breathless and steaming from the endless uphill exertion that is my life, and the girl at the ticket counter was telling me that she had no record of my reservation. ""This isn't happening,"" I said. ""I'm still at home in England enjoying Christmas.Pass me a drop more port, will you, darling?"" Actually, I said, ""There must be some mistake. Please look again."" The girl studied the passenger list. ""No, Mr Bryson, your name is not here*"" But I could see it, even upside-down. ""There it is, second from the bottom,, ""No,"" the girl decided, ""that says Bemt Bjornson. That's a Norwegian name*"" ""It doesn't say Bernt Bjornson. It says Bill Bryson. Look at the loop of the 'y', the two 'I's. Miss, please."" But she wouldn't have it. ""If I miss this bus when does the next one go?""""Next week at the same time.,, Oh, splendid. ""Miss, believe me, it says Bill Bryson."" ""No, it doesn't."" ""Miss, look, I've come from England. I'm carrying some medicine that could save a child's life.""She didn't buy this. ""I want to see the manager."" ""He's in Stavanger."" ""Listen, I made a reservation by telephone.If I don't get on this bus I'm going to write a letter to your manager that will cast a shadow over your career prospects for the rest of this century."" This clearly did not alarm her. Then it occurred to me. ""If this Bemt Bjornson doesn't show up, can I have his seat?"" ""Sure."" Why don't I think of these things in the first place and save myself the suffering? ""Thank you,"" I said, and dragged my bag outside."	"[""the author's journey to the north was not smooth""]"
According to the passage, how can we solve the problems around Lake Victoria?	Lake Victoria is the largest lake in AfricA. It is also the second largest lake in the world. It is an important lake because it is one of the sources for the longest river in the world, the Nile River.Lake Victoria provides a source of water, food, and power for several African countries.Lake Victoria is a big part of African life. Unfortunately, Lake Victoria has a problem. _ .There are several power stations at Lake Victoria in Uganda. These are on the Nile River, and besides producing power, they keep the water of the lake at a certain level.For the past forty years, that level has been 11.9 meters.Over the last several years, the water level has dropped by about 2.5 meters.There seem to be several reasons for this drop. One possible reason is drought .Drought has been very bad in the area since 2000.Lake Victoria gets all of its water from rain, so the drought means less water in the lake. However, some environmentalists believe that the real problem is the power plants(factories) on Lake Victoria. Uganda depends on those power plants for most of its power, and they made the power plants larger in 2000.Many people believe the power plants have been taking too much water off Lake Victoria. As a result, they have been asked to use less water until Lake Victoria goes back to its old level. Whether the low water level is caused by drought or power plants, the result is the same.This is already a poor area of Africa, where many people live a really hard life.People, animals and plants around Lake Victoria will suffer even more from low water levels on the lake.Many people need Lake Victoria for fishing or growing food. Fish need the water to live, and animals need it for water.Plants around the lake will die without the water, and then more animals and people will suffer.Unless the lake fills soon, many people will suffer and die.	['More sources of water must be found.']
"According to Jessica's mother, ""a skeleton in the closet"" means _ ."	"""Mum, what does it mean when someone tells you that they have a skeleton in the closet ?"" Jessica asked. ""A skeleton in the closet?"" her mother paused thoughtfully.""Well, it's something that you would rather not have anyone else know about. For example, if in the past, someone in Dad's family had been arrested for stealing a horse, it would be 'a skeleton in his family's closet'. He really wouldn't want any neighbor to know about it."" ""Why pick on my family?"" Jessica's father said with anger. ""Your family history isn't so good, you know.

""Yes, but people these days say that you are not a real Australian unless your ancestors arrived as prisoners."" ""Gosh, sorry I asked. I think I understand now,"" Jessica cut in before things grew worse. After dinner, the house was very quiet. Jessica's parents were still quite angry with each other.

When she finished, she gathered the freshly pressed clothes in her arms and walked to Jessica's closet. Just as she opened the door and reached in to hang a skirt, a bony arm stuck out from the dark depths and a bundle of white bones fell to the floor. Jessica's mother sank in a faint , waking only when Jessica put a cold, wet cloth on her forehead. She looked up to see the worried faces of her husband and daughter. ""What happened? Where am I?"" she asked.""You just destroyed the school's skeleton, Mum,"" explained Jessica. ""I brought it home to help me with my health project. I meant to tell you, but it seemed that as soon as I mentioned skeletons and closets, it caused a problem between you and Dad.""

How many members are there in Rashida's family?	"Every evening, 15-year-old Rashida returns home from school, changes out of her uniform, and rushes to a neighboring farm to help her mother harvest vegetables. Her father is disabled, so the modest profit the two of them earn must cover food, clothing and other necessities for all seven children and their parents. Despite having precious little time to study, Rashida is one of the top students at her junior secondary school. But with so much responsibility on her small shoulders, she admits that it is sometimes hard for her to imagine a more promising future. Last year, Rashida was invited to join 155 other girls at Camfed Ghana's first Girls' Career Camp, a program designed to inspire girls growing up in the country's Northern Region to dream big, and to support them to pursue those dreams. ""We organized this camp because we wanted to let girls know that even if they are struggling with poverty, their lives will not be defined by limitations,"" says Dolores Dickson, Camfed Ghana's Executive Director. Over the course of five days, the camp led the junior and secondary school students through a range of experiences and career opportunities that were entirely new to them. Dr. Agnes Apusiga, a lecturer from the University of Development Studies, ran the workshop on goal-setting and career choices, describing the universities and training colleges in Ghana that could help them achieve their dreams. Participants then visited the University for Development Studies, where they toured the medical school and science labs. Another highlight was a workshop at the computer lab at Tamale Secondary School. Many of the girls had studied information technology from a book but had never before seen a computer. ""When the girls arrived at camp, they were not ambitious, because they didn't have any idea what the world held for them,"" says Eugenia Ayagiba, Project Officer with Camfed Ghana. ""Many had scarcely traveled beyond their own villages."" ""I think the most important thing that happened at the camp is that we opened a window of hope for a group of girls coming from backgrounds of poverty,"" says Eugenia. For Rashida, who has been laughed at in the past by her schoolmates because of her father's disability, the experience was important. ""She told one of the camp mentors that when she is at school, she often feels like a misfit, and she prefers to keep to herself,"" says Eugenia. ""But at the camp, it was different. She made friends with girls who have similar struggles. She took part in every single activity, every single game. On the last day, she said to her mentor, ""The camp has challenged me to study hard. Now I see that there is light at the end of the tunnel."""	['Nine']
The author went outside to destroy the porch because _ .	"""I don't think I can do this any more."" ""Yes, you can. You only have five more radiation treatments to go. "" I held my wife Becky close. Ever since the breast cancer diagnosis , she had tried hard to be strong for the kids and for me. When her diagnosis came, my first thought was there was no way I could lose my wife. The doctors assured us the cancer was discovered early so we were feeling positive. Becky had received an operation and was recovering from it. After six weeks of radiation therapy , she was facing her final five treatments. She was weak and tired, in low spirits. Seeing her suffering, I felt so helpless and powerless. As soon as I was outside, long-held frustration and anger erupted in me like a volcano. I took a hammer and suddenly was swinging as hard as I could, beating heavily on the front porch . While doing so, I imagined I was beating my wife's cancer. With all my strength, I destroyed the porch. During the treatment, my wife had been very brave. She said she had it easy, but I don't think it was easy for her. Seeing the porch gone, Becky shook her head at the window. I came into the room, not knowing how she would react to what I had done. ""Becky, are you mad at me?"" She looked at me in surprise. ""For what?"" I pointed at the gate. ""For tearing down the porch."" She laughed. ""Look how sunny this room is now. I love that it's bright in here."" ""You comforted me in my darker hour, Vince. You've found a way to deal with your own frustration. By destroying the porch, you let the sunshine in."" As I looked around the brightened room, I realized the light that filled the space was the light of hope that shone so bright after the darkness. We never did re-build the porch."

Another time I say, in a voice so friendly it surprises even me: ""Do you think you'll take your posters and pictures with you, or will you get new ones at college?"" She answers, her voice filled with annoyance, ""How should I know?"" My daughter is off with friends most of the time. Yesterday was the last day she'd have until Christmas with her friend Katharine, whom she's known since kindergarten. Soon, it will be her last day with Sarah, Claire, Heather... and then it will be her last day with me. My friend Karen told me, ""The August before I left for college, I screamed at my mother the whole month. Be prepared."" I stand in the kitchen, watching Allie make a glass of iced tea. Her face, once so open and trusting, is closed to me. I struggle to think of something to say to her, something meaningful and warm. I want her to know I'm excited about the college she has chosen, that I know the adventure of her life is just starting and that I am proud of her. But the look on her face is so mad that I think she might slug me if I open my mouth. One night -- after a long period of silence between us -- I asked what I might have done or said to make her angry with me. She sighed and said, ""Mom, you haven't done anything. It's fine."" It is fine -- just distant. Somehow in the past we had always found some way to connect. When Allie was a toddler , I would go to the day- care center after work. I'd find a quiet spot and she would nurse -- our eyes locked together, reconnecting with each other. In middle school, when other mothers were already lamenting the estrangement they felt with their adolescent daughters, I hit upon a solution: rescue raids. I would show up occasionally at school, sign her out of class and take her somewhere -- out to lunch, to the movies, once for a long walk on the beach. It may sound irresponsible, but it kept us close when other mothers and daughters were floundering. We talked about everything on those outings -- outings we kept secret from family and friends. When she started high school, I'd get up with her in the morning to make her a sandwich for lunch, and we'd silently drink a cup of tea together before the 6:40 bus came. A couple of times during her senior year I went into her room at night, the light off, but before she went to sleep. I'd sit on the edge of her bed, and she'd tell me about problems: a teacher who lowered her grade because she was too shy to talk in class, a boy who teased her, a friend who had started smoking. Her voice, coming out of the darkness, was young and questioning. A few days later I'd hear her on the phone, repeating some of the things I had said, things she had adopted for her own. But now we are having two kinds of partings. I want the romanticized version, where we go to lunch and lean across the table and say how much we will miss each other. I want smiles through tears, bittersweet moments of reminiscence and the chance to offer some last bits of wisdom. But as she prepares to depart, Allie's feelings have gone underground. When I reach to touch her arm, she pulls away. She turns down every invitation I extend. She lies on her bed, reading Emily Dickinson until I say I have always loved Emily Dickinson, and then she closes the book. Some say the tighter your bond with your child, the greater her need to break away, to establish her own identity in the world. The more it will hurt, they say. A friend of mine who went through a difficult time with her daughter but now has become close to her again, tells me,"" Your daughter will be back to you."" ""I don't know,"" I say. I sometimes feel so angry that I want to go over and shake Allie. I want to say, ""Talk to me -- or you're grounded!"" I feel myself wanting to say that most horrible of all mother phrases: ""Think of everything I've done for you."" Late one night, as I'm getting ready for bed she comes to the bathroom door and watches me brush my teeth. For a moment, I think I must be brushing my teeth in a way she doesn't approve of. But then she says, ""I want to read you something."" It's a pamphlet from her college. ""These are tips for parents."" I watch her face as she reads the advice aloud: ""'Don't ask your child if she is homesick,' it says. 'She might feel bad the first few weeks, but don't let it worry you. This is a natural time of transition. Write her letters and call her a lot. Send a package of goodies...' "" Her voice breaks, and she comes over to me and buries her head in my shoulder. I stroke her hair, lightly, afraid she'll bolt if I say a word. We stand there together for long moments, swaying. Reconnecting. I know it will be hard again. It's likely there will be a fight about something. But I am grateful to be standing in here at midnight, both of us tried and sad, toothpaste smeared on my chin, _ ."

This passage is most likely to be found in the _ section of a newspaper.	The number of big-production movies shot in San Francisco has _ with the rise of digital technology. Instead of going on location, producers can recreate the city's look in studios with the help of computers at lower cost. But San Francisco still attracts moviemakers, as its long history of film offers plenty of iconic spots to visit. Here are just a few: Alcatraz: The Enforcer (1976), Escape From Alcatraz(1979), Murder in the First (1995), The Rock (1996) A federal prison from 1934 to 1963, Alcatraz housed notorious criminals. Now a national park, Alcatraz offers visitors a chance to tour the prison, including a look at one of the cells portrayed in Clint Eastwood's Escape from Alcatraz, with the concrete chipped away behind the vent . Fort Point, Golden Gate Bridge: High Anxiety (1977), Foul Play (1978), The Presidio(1988), Dopamine(2003) Built to protect the San Francisco Bay area from attacks during the Civil War, Fort Point is where James Stewart saved Kim Novak in Vertigo, right at the base. The bridge has also been blown up countless times on films, including inX-Men:The last Stand (2006) andMonsters vs. Aliens(2009). The best view is from the north side, looking back to the city. Coit Tower: The Enforcer, Inner Space(1987), The Presidio, Sister Act 2(1993), The Rock, Dr. Dolittle (1998), Boys and Girls(2003) The narrow white concrete column at the top of Telegraph Hill has been a part of San Francisco's skyline since 1933, and offers amazing views of the bay and the city. Coit Tower has been in the backdrop of numerous movies filmed in San Francisco. City Hall: A view to a Kill(1985),Class Action(1991),Final Analysis(1992),Bedazzled(2000),The Wedding Planner(2001), Milk(2008) City Hall has one of the largest domes in the world and it replaced a structure destroyed in the 1906 earthquake. It was used at the end of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Metro City Hall in the 2010 animated movie,Megamind, was an homage to San Francisco's City Hall.	['travel']

We were driving in the right lane when, suddenly, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver stopped his car at once. The tire made a very loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just one inch from the black of the other car. I was _ . But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head and started yelling at us. I couldn't believe it! But my taxi driver just smiled at the guy. So I asked, ""Why did you just do that? This guy almost sent us to hospital. "" This is when my taxi driver taught me what I now call ""The Law of the Rubbish Truck . "" He explained that many people are like rubbish trucks. They run around full of rubbish, full of anger and full of bad feelings. As their rubbish piles up, they look for a place to throw it away and sometimes they'll throw it at you. Don't take it personally. Just smile, wish them well, and move on. Don't take their rubbish and spread it to other people at work, at home or on the streets. Successful people never let rubbish trucks change their moods . Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets, so love those who love you and pray for those who don't."	['airport']

"When school was out, I hurried to find my sister and get out of the schoolyard before seeing anybody in my class. But Barbara and her friends had beaten us to the playground entrance and they seemed to be waiting for us. Barbara said, ""So now you' re in the A class. "" She sounded impressed. ""What' s the A class? ""I asked. Everybody made superior yet faintly envious giggling sounds. ""Well, why did you think the teacher moved you to the front of the room, Dopey? Didn' t you know you were in the C class before, way in the back of the room? "" Of course I hadn' t known. The Wenatchee fifth grade was bigger than my whole school which had been in North Dakota, and the idea of subdivisions within a grade had never occurred to me. The subdividing for the first marking period had been done before I came to the school, and I had never, in the six weeks I' d been there, talked to anyone long enough to find out about the A, B, and C classes. I still could not understand why that had made such a difference to Barbara and her friends. I didn' t yet know that it was shameful and dirty to be a transient laborer and ridiculous to be from North Dakota. I thought living in a tent was more fun than living in a house. I didn' t know that we were gypsies, really (how that thought would have excited me then! ), and that we were regarded with the suspicion felt by those who plant toward those who do not plant. It didn' t occur to me that we were all looked upon as one more of the untrustworthy natural phenomena, drifting here and there like mists or winds, I didn' t know that I was the only child who had camped on the Baumann' s land ever to get out of the C class. I didn' t know that school administrators and civic leaders held conferences to talk about the problem of transient laborers. I only knew that for two happy days I walked to school with Barbara and her friends, played hopscotch and jumped rope with them at class intervals, and was even invited into the house for some ginger ale--a strange drink I had never tasted before."

We can learn from the passage that businesses will _ .	"Businesses are witnessing a difficult time,which has in turn produced influence on consumers' desire to go green.However,shoppers are still laying stress on environmental concerns. Two thirds of customers say that environmental considerations _ their purchases to the same degree as they did a year ago,while more than a quarter say that they are now even better aware of the environmental effect on what they buy. This may help to influence how shops store goods on their shelves.And the companies should still make efforts to become more environmentally friendly.Two out of three people think it is important to buy from environmentally responsible companies,with about one in seven saying that they had even decided to take their custom elsewhere if they felt a company's environmental reputation was not good enough. Harry Morrison,chief executive of the Carbon Trust,sympathizes:""I understand this situation where survival is very important now.But from environmental considerations,the clock is ticking--we don't have much time.In addition,cutting carbon has an immediate effect as costs drop and a mediumterm benefit for the brand."" Larger companies have an extra motivation to look at reducing their carbon footprint,as new rules next year will require businesses to buy carbon allowances to make up for their emissions .Those that have taken early action will have a head start.More than two thirds of consumers are not clear about which companies are environmentally responsible.This suggests that firms that are able to relay clearly their message to the public will be in a pole position to attract shoppers. The Carbon Trust believes that it can help by informing customers about the good work companies are doing.""When companies are granted the standard,they can use a logo in all their marketing which makes it clear that they are working towards cutting emissions,"" Mr.Morrison said.

Dear Heli and Risto, You are on my mind tonight because we are using the candles you gave us when you visited us two years ago.There was a horrible summer thunderstorm this evening and the power went out,and your candles were just what we needed.They have lit our dinnertime,the bedrooms and now I am sitting by one in the kitchen... What I didn't say to Heli and Risto is that we never burned the candles before because they,well,smell like a campfire.And so they stood in iron candlesticks until we needed them. I'm so thankful that we had candles on hand that dark night.And I'm equally as thankful that I had a beautiful card on hand,too,or I would have let the opportunity to keep in touch with faraway family escape.It would have turned into another one of those moments when the thought of sending a card crossed my mind but never actually happened. The candle burned slowly.After I finished my card to Finland,I enjoyed looking through the rest of my ""Someone Cares"" greeting cards.The air was fresh and cool,and I had cards and enough light to write.I found a birthday card for my nephew's 10th birthday,a thinkingofyou card for my aunt,and a fun greeting card for an old friend and I began writing.Candles and cards--two things that make a thunderstorm into the perfect storm."

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	Salt plays an important role in our daily diet. Even a small reduction in salt in the diet can be a big help to the heart. A new study used a computer model to predict -how just three grams less a day would affect heart disease in the United States. The result: Thirteen percent fewer heart attacks. Eight percent fewer strokes. Four percent fewer deaths. Eleven percent fewer new cases of heart disease. And two hundred forty billion dollars in health care savings. Researchers found it could prevent one hundred thousand heart attacks and ninety-two thousand deaths every year. The study is in the New England Journal of Medicine. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo at the University of California San Francisco was the lead author. She says people would not even notice a difference in taste with three grams,or one-half teaspoon, less salt per day. The team also included researchers at Stanford and Columbia University. Each gram of salt contains four hundred milligrams of sodiu , which is how foods may list their salt content. The government says the average American man eats ten grams of salt a day. The American Heart Association advises no more than three grams for healthy people. It says salt in the American diet has increased fifty percent since the nineteen seventies, while blood pressures have also risen. Less salt can mean a lower blood pressure. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is leading an effort called the National Salt Reduction Initiative.The idea is to put pressure on food companies and restaurants. Critics call it government interference. Mayor Bloomberg has already succeeded in other areas, like requiring fast food places in the city to list calorie information. Now a study by the Seattle Children's Research Institute shows that the calorie information on the menu can influence what parents order for their children. Ninety-nine parents of three to six year olds took part. Half had calories between the two groups for foods that the parents would have chosen for themselves. McDonald's menus clearly showing how many calories were in each food. Parents given the counts chose an average of one hundred two fewer calories when asked what they would order for their children. Yet there was no difference in calories between the two groups for foods that the parents would have chosen for themselves. Study leader Pooja Tandon says even small calorie reductions on a regular basis can prevent weight gain over time.The study was published in the journal Pediatrics.

Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?	"What would you do if your pet cat died just before Christmas? Many cat lovers would go out and buy another cat. But one American woman was unable to bear life without her much loved pet cat Nicky. He had been with her for 17 years; and when she knew he was going to die, she had him cloned. Little Nicky was cloned by an American company, called GSC. But the new cat cost his owner $50,000. ""He is the same. His characteristics are the same,"" the woman told news reporters. The company, Sausalito-based Genetic Savings and Clone, made her available to speak to reporters only on condition that her name or hometown was not used. The woman said she feared being the target of groups against cloning. ""Nicky loved water, which is an unusual characteristic of cats. Little Nicky jumped into my bath. Most cats are afraid of water, but Little Nicky is different: he loves it, just like my old cat,"" said the woman, who said she was in her early 40s and worked in the airline industry. The company delivered Little Nicky two weeks ago and was expected to publicly announce the news on Thursday. However, the cat's creation has raised heated debate. Many people have said they felt disgusted at the amount of money spent on cloning a cat. They said that she should have chosen one of the many cats without a home -- cats like this are a common problem in many countries. The woman has only told news reporters her first name, Julia, but she has already received nearly 100 frightening letters from angry people, who say that cloning is against nature. Little Nicky was not only expensive, but also, like all cloned animals, may have more health problems than an animal which was born in the usual way. GSC said it had to try 80 times before it succeeded in producing a cloned cat. The company is now using new techniques and soon they hope to produce cloned dogs as well as cats. GSC said that if people were not happy with the cloned cats or dogs, they could have their money back. At the moment the cost of cloning is very high, but the manager of CSC said he hoped that eventually it would go down, and that in five years, the cost should be $20,000 for a dog or $10,000 for a cat."

According to the passage, who ought to get off the bus?	"Many years ago I lived in a western country. My very first job was in the city and I was excited to go to work by public transport! I had never been employed before and my chances of travelling on a bus by myself had always been very slim. So, I was very happy with my new lifestyle! I left home each morning in time to catch the 8.05 bus from the main road. One autumn morning I could see the bus approaching. I could also see an elderly lady walking with a lovely dog beside her. There were some youngsters behind her. The bus arrived and we got on. Only eight passengers were permitted to travel standing. I was inside the bus when the conductor called, ""Only eight standing passengers! Could the last one to get on please get off?"" I saw those youngsters inside, right in front of me, and it occurred that they had jumped the queue! I turned and saw the elderly lady with her dog about to get off. I moved quickly to get in front of her. I encouraged her to stay, knowing very well I would be late that morning, but it didn't bother me. It was only as I moved past her to get off the bus that I realized -- she was blind! Her dog was her guide dog! Well, I eventually got to the office. After the day's work I went to the bus stand in front of my office to make the return journey. What a pleasant surprise! The lady and her dog were there! I was really pleased because I would get a better chance to speak with her. I started the conversation and she recognized my Asian accent! She asked if I was the same person who helped her that morning. Amazing! From there onwards it was one long happy conversation. These beautiful memories are still fresh in my mind. By helping others, I feel content!"	['One of those youngsters']
The passage is chosen from _ .	"The United Nations is warning that the world is not prepared to deal with the fast growth of cities. The World Economic and Social Survey 2013 calls for new ways to meet the needs of city populations. More than 6.5 billion people are expected to be living in cities by 2050. Most new city dwellers will be in developing countries. The United Nations says the effect on limited resources in many countries will be huge. The World Economic and Social Survey points to the increasing demand for energy, water, sanitation, public services, education and health care. The world population is expected to rise to more than nine billion by 2050, two-thirds of all people are expected to live in cities. The United Nations says about 80 percent of this growing urban population will be found in Africa and Asia. The report says sustainable development of urban areas requires coordination and investments to deal with important issues, these include land-use, food security, job creation and transportation. Willem Van Der Geest is with the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, he says cities need to work closely with rural communities, so that food supplies can be secured, and the environment can be protected. ""We need enough integration(,) with cities... An integration between the rural and urban economies is absolutely vital for issues of nutrition, food security, and environmental sustainability."" The report says development in a sustainable way is important to end poverty. The report also examines the problem of food insecurity, which affects hundreds of millions of people around the world. One in eight people still severely lack nutrition. UN officials say some things are clear. The Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development, Shamshad Akhtar, says world food production will have to increase by 70%, that increase will be needed to feed the additional 2.3 billion people expected on the planet by the middle of the century. She says an important part of meeting that need is to waste less food. ""There has to be efforts to reduce food wastage. ."" Food and nutrition security are core elements of the sustainable development agenda."	['a newspaper']
After the improvement of the hospital environment, _ .	Bringing Art into Hospitals The medical world is gradually realizing that the quality of the environment in hospitals may play an important role in helping patients to get better. As part of nationwide effort in Britain to bring art out of the museums and into public places, some of the country's best artists have been called in to change older hospitals and to soften the hard edges of modern buildings. Of the 2500 national health service hospitals in Britain, almost 100 now have very valuable collections of present art in passages, waiting areas and treatment rooms. These recent movements first started by one artist, Peter Senior, who set up his studio at a Manchester hospital in northeastern England during the early 1970s.He felt the artist had lost his place in modern society, and that art should be enjoyed by a wider audience . A common hospital waiting room might have as many as 5 000 visitors each week. What a better place to hold regular exhibitions of art! Senior held the first exhibition of his own paintings in the out--patient's waiting area of the Manchester Royal Hospital in 1975.Believed to be Britain's first hospital artist. Senior was so much in demand that he was soon joined by a team of six young art school graduates. The effect is striking. Now in the passages and waiting rooms the visitor experiences a full view of fresh colours, playful images and restful courtyards. The quality of the environment may reduce the need for expensive drugs when a patient is recovering from an illness. A study has shown that patients who had a view onto gardens needed half the number of strong pain killers compared with patients who had no view at all or only a brick wall to look at.

Now you can see many paintings in tree holes on a road in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province. What's up? These paintings are painted by Wang Yue, 23, a college student at Dalian Polytechnic University. Wang describes her tree hole paintings as ""a beautiful journey"" through which she adds fun to her hometown.

But in the latest box office hit 2012 it is neither aliens nor a killer disease that threaten the human race, but climate change. Some say the film lacks good dialogue and its science is questionable, others believe German director Roland Emmerich makes up for these flaws in special effects. An earthquake destroys the White House and Yellow stone National Park ends up in flames. Emmerich borrows from the old Mayan story which says, that the world will end in 2012.He is being criticized for Internet rumors about doomsday ""There is no factual basis for these claims,'' NASA said on its website.

What is the attitude of Henkel towards taking photos?	"With parents flooding their camera phones with hundreds of photos -- from loose teeth to each step in the potty training process -- how might the photos affect our memories? Maryanne Garry, a psychology professor, has studied the effects of photography on our memories for years. ""I think the problem is that people are giving away being in the moment. Those parents at the park taking all those photos are actually paying less attention to the moment, because they're focusing on the act of taking the photo."" she says. Henkel, who researches human memory at Fairfield University in Connecticut, began an experiment by sending groups of students to the university's art museum. The students observed some objects and photographed others. Then, back at the lab, they were given a memory test. Henkel found what she called a ""photo-taking impairment effect."" ""The objects that they had taken photos of -- they actually remembered fewer of them, and remembered fewer details. Like, how was this statue's hands positioned, or what was this statue wearing on its head."" she says. Her students' memories were impaired because relying on an external memory aid meant they subconsciously counted on the camera to remember the details. ""As soon as you hit 'click' on that camera, it's as if you've outsourced your memory,"" she says. ""Any time we count on these external memory devices, we're taking away the kind of mental cognitive processing that might help us actually remember that stuff on our own."" Henkel says it's also a mistake to think of photographs as memories. The photo will remain the same to you each time you look at it, but memories change over time. ""Each time I remember what my high school graduation was like, I might be color1ing and changing that memory because of my current perspective -- because of new ideas that I have or things that I learned afterwards,"" she says. ""Human memory is much more dynamic than photographs."" But Henkel doesn't want people to stop taking photos. Instead, she'd like us to be more mindful when taking pictures in the first place. They're still valuable tools that can provide ""rich retrieval clues"" later on."	['Objective.']
The following features belong to night owls except that _ .	They are most likely to be healthy, wealthy and wise, according to the old saying. But those who are early to bed and early to rise do not always have the upper hand, researchers say. They have revealed that night owls are generally brighter and wealthier than those able to get up early in the morning. 1 Experts from the University of Madrid carried out tests on around 1,000 teenagers and found that those who preferred to stay up late demonstrated the kind of intelligence associated with honored jobs and higher incomes. 2 The researchers examined the habits and body clocks of the youngsters to determine whether they liked to stay up late and sleep in later in the morning, or preferred to go to bed early and were at their peak in the morning. 3 School performance and inductive intelligence, or problem solving, were measured and academic grades in the major subjects were also taken into account. The results showed that evening types scored higher than morning types on inductive reasoning, which has been shown to be a good estimate of general intelligence and a strong indicator of academic performance. 4 They also had a greater capacity to think conceptually as well as analytically. Such abilities have been linked to innovative thinking, more admired occupations and better incomes. Famous night owls include President Obama, Charles Darwin, Winston Churchill, Keith Richards and Elvis Presley. George W Bush, who is regularly in bed by 10pm, Thomas Edison, Napoleon, Condoleezza Rice, who wakes at 4.30am, and Ernest Hemingway are among those known as larks . Jim Horne, professor of psychophysiology at Loughborough University, said: 'Evening types tend to be the more active and creative types, the poets, artists and inventors, while the morning types are the deducers , as often seen with civil servants and accountants.' A previous study of US Air Force recruits found evening types were much better at thinking laterally to solve problems than larks.	['Night owls are much healthier, wealthier and wiser']

They look for new places that they have never been to and add new and exciting experiences to their journey. Some of them like to climb mountains,. others like to go to the sea or a lake to swim, because theses can make them get exercise and are good for their health. Many Polish people also like to do sports in their free time. They are usually crazy about football, and football is regarded as the Polish national sport. Many football fans may support a certain team ,so they go to watch every match of the team they support, and they buy many things that have any relation with the team. Watching sport and doing it are both good ways to relax In addition, doctors say that doing sports is very good for the health.

And they really enjoy their free time.	['relax themselves in their spare time']
Which of the following statements is true according to the text?	"Diamonds are no longer a girl's best friend, according to a new U.S. study that found three of four women would prefer a new plasma TV to a diamond necklace. The survey, specially by U.S. cable television's Oxygen Net-work that is operated by women found the technology gender gap has almost closed with most women buying new technology and using it easily. Women were found on average to own 6.6 technology devices while men own 6.9, and four out of every five women felt comfortable using technology with 46 percent doing their own computer trouble--shooting ""People have the thought that women are not as advanced as men when it comes to technology and I was surprised at the equivalence men and women now have in terms of technology,"" Geraldine Laybourne, chairman and chief executive of Oxygen Network said. The Girls Gone Wired survey of 1,400 women and 700 men aged 15 to 49, which was conducted by market researcher TRU, found that given the choice, women would choose tech items rather than luxury items like jewelry or vacations. The study found 77 percent of women surveyed would prefer a new plasma television to a diamond necklace and 56 percent would go for a new plasma TV over a weekend vacation in Florida. Even shoes lost out. The study found 86 percent would prefer a new digital video camera to a pair of designer shoes. The study found over the next five years women see themselves increasing their activities in six tech areas: digital cameras, cell phones, e-mail, camera phones, text-messaging and instant messaging. Laybourne said this increasing use of technology among women was expected to continue."	['Women used tech items less than men in the past.']
According to the passage, which statement is true?	"He has lived through various dangers but time may be running out for the Palestinian leader , Yasser Arafat . On September 11, Israel announced its decision to remove him , following several Palestinian suicide bomb attacks on Israel . ""He should be punished for the killings ,"" an Israeli official said , ""He has done nothing to stop the terrorist groups ."" But the decision has angered many other countries . China said that Arafat is the true leader , elected by the Palestinian people , and removing him would harm the peace in the Middle East . This idea is shared by other governments . Arafat himself said : ""They can kill me , but never get me out of my country ."" He has spent most of his life in danger as the most important aim of Israel .But , just like a cat with nine lives , Arafat escaped every time . For years he has made a practice of sleeping in a different bed each night , thinking a moving person is harder to hit . In 1985 , Israel sent fighter planes to kill Arafat . The wild bombing destroyed his office in Tunis but Arafat himself was unhurt . In 1992 , the aircraft in which he was flying over north Africa broke in two during a crash landing . The pilot was killed but he managed to remain alive . What is so unbelievable is that he always remains calm in great danger . Israeli tanks and planes attacked his office building in Ramallah in December , 2001 . When they saw the attackers coming , Arafat's bodyguards ignored his orders to stay still and carried him to safety underground . Seconds later , several bombs were dropped nearby . Though safe , his bodyguards were so frightened that they were wet in sweat . But , Arafat , with Israeli tanks only 200 meters away , showed no fear at all . He stayed in the damaged office , talking by phone with foreign leaders in hope of preventing further attacks from Israel . All these experiences have made him a beloved leader to his people and an enemy to some others . But has he used up the last of his nine lives ? Only time will tell ."

How did the couple's parents react to the wedding?	"Birmingham----The wedding took place in aprefix = st1 /Birminghamhotel. The bride and her father arrived in a new black American sports car. Her father looked nervous and uncomfortable in front of the cameras. The bride wore a silk wedding dress. She smiled nervously at the waiting photographers and went to a room on the first floor where she met her future husband for the very first time. Carla Germaine and Greg Cordell were the winners of a radio station's competition. The aim of the competition was to find two strangers prepared to marry without having met each other. Miss Germaine,23, is a model. Mr. Cordell, 27, is a TV salesman. They were among the two hundred people who entered for a peculiar ""experiment"" organized by BMRB radio in Birmingham,England. Greg and Carla were among eight finalists who were interviewed live on radio. They took a lie detector test and the station also spoke to their friends and family about their personalities. The competition judges included an astrologer who declared that they were suited. The couple celebrated their wedding with a wedding breakfast and a party for 100 guests in the evening, but not everyone shared their joy. Miss Germaine's mother looked anxious throughout the wedding and Mr. Cordell's parents are reported to be less than delighted. Organizations, including the marriage guidance service Relate, have criticized the marriage. As one person put it, ""We have enough problems getting young people to take marriage seriously without this. Marriage should always be about love."" The couple are now on a Caribbean honeymoon followed by journalists. Their other prizes include a year's free use of a wonderful apartment in the centre ofBirmingham, and a car. But will it last?"

Why are some names always in our phone books?	"TS said that everyone has a changing circle of friends. However, no matter how frequently we renew our phone books, some names always remain. These names remind us of the good times we spent together with our friends. Though we may not see them every day, they will always stay in our hearts. Tom was often called ""Big Head"" at school because of his extraordinarily large head. He was one of my close friends at primary school. But since graduation, we have been studying in different cities and haven't seen each other for a long time. Several days ago, I received an e-mail saying that my former classmates from primary school were holding a party to get together and chat about past memories. I was so excited because [ would get to see Tom again. What would he look like now? Would we still feel as close to each other as we had done back then? I was a little frightened about what I would find. When I arrived at the party, I did manage to recognize Tom. However, he was much taller than he had been before. What's more, his head was no longer big. ""Hi, Buddy. Do you recognize me?"" Tom walked towards me. ""Of course. How could I ever forget our ' Big Head' ,"" I said jokingly, ""But where has your big head gone?"" ""Haha, maybe it didn't keep up with the steps of time and stayed in the past,"" Tom patted his own head and answered with a laugh. All my _ suddenly disappeared. I realized that time had changed us outwardly, but our friendship hadn't changed at all. I chatted happily with Tom about our shared experiences in primary school. Then I looked around the small room and saw different faces, both familiar and unfamiliar, but none of them the faces of strangers. The whole party was filled with a warm atmosphere. Everyone was lost in the sweet memories of childhood. They forgot all their present-day stresses and pressures. ""Hey, what are you thinking about? Come and get some pizza!"" A call from a friend woke me up from my thoughts. I hurried towards the table. ""Wait! That biggest piece is mine!"""	"[""Because we'll never forget some of our friends.""]"

What is the meaning of doing the V gesture?	"Are you still doing the V for victory sign? It's out. The latest popular hand gesture is to curl both of your hands and put them together to make a heart shape. Known as ""Hand heart"", many young stars in the US including Justin Bieber, Blake Lively and Taylor Swift have done the gesture in recent photos. ""The heart hand gesture means something between I love you and thank you."" said the country singer Taylor Swift. It's a sweet, easy message which you can send without saying a word."" Taylor Swift often puts her hands above her head in the heart shape at her concerts. And she is believed to be the first to make the gesture popular. Last month during a charity show, Justin Bieber and his superstar friends did the hand heart and put the photo online. They did it to help three kids whose parents were killed in a car accident. The gesture became more popular after that. ""It used to take longer for nonverbal culture to move. But now, with smart phones and the Internet, it's much faster,"" said Patti Wood, an American language expert . In our neighbor country--South Korea, the hand heart has been popular for a long time. In a different way, people there like making a ""bigger heart"" by putting their hands above their heads and making a heart shape with their arms. It means ""I love you."""	['We have won.']
What should ideal cacao farming be like?	Most people today think of chocolate as something sweet to eat or drink and can be easily found in stores around the world. It might surprise you that chocolate was once highly treasured. The wealthy people of Spain first enjoyed a sweetened chocolate drink. Later, the popularity of the drink spread throughout Europe. Chocolate remained a drink that only wealthy people could afford to drink until the eighteenth century. During the period known as the Industrial Revolution, new technologies helped make chocolate less costly to produce. Farmers grow cacao trees in many countries in Africa, Central and South America, but these trees are difficult to grow. They require an exact amount of water, warmth, soil and protection. After about five years, cacao trees start producing large fruits called pods, which grow near the trunk of the tree. The seeds inside these pods are harvested to make chocolate. Growing cacao is very hard work for farmers. Today, chocolate industry officials, activists, and scientists are working with farmers. They are trying to make sure that cacao can be grown in a way that is easy for the farmers and safe for the environment. The market value of the yearly cacao crop around the world is more than five billion dollars. Chocolate is especially popular in Europe and the United States. Each year, Americans eat an average of more than 5 kilograms of chocolate per person. Specialty shops that sell costly chocolate are also very popular. Many offer chocolate lovers the chance to taste chocolate grown in different areas of the world.	['Easy and environment-friendly.']
What might be the title for the passage?	"Ask anybody out there, what is the most important thing in his life - Fame, Fortune and Money, and there is a chance that he is going to say, money, because with that, fame and fortune comes quite easily. On the other hand, if you add ""family"" to these three choices given above, there is a chance that 99% of the people are going to put their family first, especially if they happen to be ladies! The main reason is because nature has created a woman to be the cherisher and the nurturer of the family, while the man is the hunter and protector of his little family. That is the natural rule which has come down through thousands of years. Even if a person happens to be a comparatively worldly-wise person and has no idea of taking on the responsibility of a family, he has a picture of a tight little _ in his subconscious . They tell a story about a successful millionaire businessman who died and the whole city came to pay its respects. One of his business competitors, met the son and said, ""We are really going to miss your father. You see, I knew your father well."" And the son replied, ""You happen to be really lucky there, because I never did."" So, you might be an extremely successful person in your own right upon Wall Street, but if your little child fails to come running out to welcome his daddy at the end of the day to be swung up in his father's arms and held there lovingly and protectively, you come in the ""nothing"" category in the business of life. Many people are under the impression that taking on the responsibility of the family is quite tiresome, but they do not know what it takes to be a parent. It is very easy to be a biological father or a biological mother, but the real mother and the real father is that person who stays awake all night when the baby is teething, teaches him right from wrong, is there to hold him when he takes his first steps, and in every way shows that he is there to cherish and protect the little one from harm. There was a man who did not believe in family, because of an unhappy childhood. But he found a faithful woman to love him unconditionally. The moment he picked up his little baby, he said, ""Well son, welcome to the world! I am here to teach you what your mama has taught me, and we shall both protect you, when you need our help. I will teach you to be a good, just and fair man."""	['What More Could a Family Be About']
There is no pollution in Iceland mainly because _ .	"To American visitors, Iceland is a very interesting country, partly because it is different in so many ways from what he or she is used to seeing at home. There are quite a few things that are not done, or that do not exist on the island - quite a few ""No's"". There is no pollution, for instance. No dogs are permitted in Reykjavik, the capital. There is no television on Thursdays or during the entire month of July, and only three hours of black-and-white TV the rest of the time. There is no hard liquor on Wednesdays and no beer at any time. There are no handguns; only one jail of thirty-five cells in the entire land - an admirable figure, even for a small country of 313,376 people. There is no army, air force or navy. There is no tipping for anything. There are no large stores open on Saturdays or Sundays. Since Iceland is situated just under the Arctic Circle, there is no darkness in summer and do daylight in winter. But thanks to Gulf Stream, the climate is rather mild, with temperatures ranging from 34 degrees Fahrenheit to 52 degrees in July. The rules on television, liquor, and guns are the result of governmental decision. But the absence of pollution is due in great part to the fact that Iceland gets its power from the enormous geyser and the thousands of hot springs that come out of the ground. They provide all the energy needed by the country. In fact, Iceland uses only 3 percent of all its available power. Iceland has been described as a democratic independent country where more fish are caught and more books published per person than anywhere else in the world. The Icelanders have always felt a particular love for literature. They composed their first works in the ninth and tenth centuries AD. These works were poems and tales about the kings, heroes, and heroines of Iceland and Norway. At first the stories were memorized and passed from generation to generation. The Icelanders have never stopped writing ever since. ""Rather shoeless than bookless,"" they proudly say."	['the Icelanders use hot water from the ground below as their energy']
Home computers can be used for _ .	The home computer industry has been growing rapidly in the United States in the last ten years. Computers used to be large, expensive machines that were very difficult to use. But scientists and technicians have been making them smaller and cheaper while at the same time they have been made easier to use. As a result, their popularity has been increasing as more people have been buying computers for their homes and businesses. Computers have been designed to store information and compute problems that are difficult for human beings to work out. Some have voices that speak to their operators. Stores use computers to keep records of their inventories and to send bills to their customers. Offices use computers to copy letters, record business and keep in touch with other offices. People also use computers in their homes to keep track of the money they spend. One important new use of computers is for entertainment. Many new games have been designed to be played on computers. People of all ages play these games. People also buy home computers to watch movies and listen to concerts at home. They have become very popular indeed.	['all of the above']
According to Arun Mathews, the main purpose of HOPE is to _ .	"A lot of grown-ups worry that spending too much time playing video games isn't good for a kid's health. Now some doctors have noticed that kids who bring their hand-held game players to the hospital seem less worried about being there. These patients also seem to experience less pain when they are concentrating on a superhero adventure or a car race. At the Johns Hopkins Children's Center in Maryland, young patients are finding hospital visits easier to deal with, thanks to a test program called the Hospital-based On-line Pediatric Environment (HOPE). Patients in HOPE have a life-threatening condition where their kidneys no longer filter wastes from their blood. To get their blood cleaned, these kids must be hooked up to dialysis machines at the hospital three times a week, for at least three hours each time. HOPE allows kids to play online sports, racing, and adventure games with each other. Eventually they will be able to connect with kids in other hospitals who are suffering from the same problem. ""We want to use the power of the Internet to bring together kids who feel that they are separated by their illness, and let them know that they are not alone,"" said Arun Mathews, the doctor who heads the program. He loves video games himself and got the idea to connect kids all over the country. Many researchers elsewhere are testing video game programs that might help young patients. For example, nine-year-old Ben Duskin of San Francisco, who was struggling with cancer helped to design a video game where players get rid of cancer cells. That's all great news, because doctors already know that reducing pain and worry helps patients heal faster."	['help kids who are suffering from illness connect with each other']
What can be inferred from the text?	As the population of the planet increases, so does the number of homes, businesses, parking lots, schools, airports and roadways. All these structures use electricity and need to be lighted. Humans demand these lights. They want their homes more comfortable and they want their streets safe. The problem is that researchers are finding that all the light is having a negative effect on humans and wildlife as well. Less than 10 years ago I drove to a thinly populated section of my town, lay down in the middle of the road and watched an attractive meteor shower . The area was short of homes, street lights and traffic. If I did that today, I wouldn't be able to see the meteor shower as well. Due to the increase in street lights, I would surely be run over by a car. Nowadays scientists are finding light pollution can be almost as bad as carbon dioxide pollution. If you've ever taken a flight at night, the view is beautiful, but you must remember that all the light you see wastes electricity. The crew of the space shuttles see an even bigger picture of how extensive the wasted electricity is worldwide. One of the saddest parts of light pollution is that most of it is unnecessary and most of the outdoor light that we use is wasted. One only needs to look at a row of street lights to see how much of the light shines upwards and lights the sky; a total waste of electricity. Additionally, somewhere electricity needs to be produced, and the production of electricity creates pollution by releasing greenhouse gases. This affects the air we breathe and our quality of life. Scientists are also studying the effects of light pollution on wildlife. Thousands of birds die each year when they crash into highly lighted buildings, as they become puzzled by the light. It has been long known that tiny baby sea turtles become lost and follow lights on the shore instead of heading towards the sea. Fortunately, light pollution is one of the easiest sources of pollution that can be corrected without a negative effect. Following some guidelines and a little searching on Google can give you many ideas on how to reduce your contribution to light pollution.	['Some animals use natural light to direct their movements.']

Which of the following could be the best title for the passage?	"Some students, parents and teachers in Shanghai were surveyed last month. According to the result of the survey, the generation gap between students and parents as well as teachers is becoming wider. Here is what they said. Voice of the students: ""Our parents hold too high _ which put us under lots of pressure. They care too much about our lives and studies,"" one student said. ""It's impolite that some students' parents read their children's diaries without permission!"" one student said angrily. ""Some of our teachers are so serious that we can't make friends with them at all,"" another student said sadly. Voice of the parents: One mother said, ""After school, my daughter usually locks herself into her room and spends lots of time talking with others on the phone. And I can't stand her clothes and hairstyle!"" ""I thought my son was doing very well in his studies. I didn't realize I was being cheated by him until I got a call from his teacher,"" said a father. Voice of the teachers: An English teacher said, ""Today, the role of the teacher is to put knowledge into students' brains. The power of teachers has kept students away from them."" ""Some parents pay too much attention to their children's grades instead of creating a lively and colorful environment at home,"" another teacher said. ""In the past, teachers and students often played games together or talked with each other. Today, only studies and grades are talked about,"" said a teacher. ""A school should be a place where students can learn not only knowledge, but also how to face failure and frustration bravely enough."	['The generation gap']
What can we infer after reading the passage?	"Abby Subark is a mother of two from Boston. ""For my kids, I'm nervous. I don't know if they'll be able to achieve their American dream."" She may be right. More than hard work or education, the best way to get rich in America is to be born rich. It is the case that somebody who is in the upper third of income, poor scores, in the bottom on tests when they are in eighth grade, is more likely to go to college and finish college than a poor kid with the top scores. That's what the working persons' children are up against. The Economic Policy Institute finds it would take a poor couple with 2 children 9 or 10 generations to achieve middle class status. That's about 200 years. The hallmark of American opportunity has always been the ability to do better than your parents. But compared with similar developed countries, the United States ranks fifth out of six for so-called intergenerational mobility . If you look at the mechanisms for upward mobility that were so readily available 50 years ago, they are becoming out of reach, like plentiful factory jobs with good wages and affordable education and health care. White families are twice as likely as blacks to be upwardly mobile. For most people in America today, _ If you started in the middle-income class, about 40 to 45 percent of what you are making right now is due to the fact that your parents were in the middle-income class. The rest is up to you. But for the millions of people who find themselves below the poverty line and the millions more who are the working poor, their starting point for the American dream leaves them painfully far away from the middle class."	['Lower starting point makes it hard for people to realize their dream.']
Which sentence is right according to the passage?	"Climbing to the Top The year 2013 is the 60th anniversary of the first successful climb to Qomolangma. Do you know why so many people wanted to reach the top of the world? It was breathtaking. It was wonderful and a bit of frightening. It was Qomolangma, the highest mountain in the world. For many years, it has attracted tens of thousands of people who tried to climb its dangerous slopes. During May's 60th anniversary of the first successful climb, nearly 600 people from around the world, including a 5-year-old Italian boy, tried to reach the ""roof of the world"". China Central Television(CCTV) also sent a team to join the adventure. It broadcasted a special program, called ""Standing at the world's third pole in 2013"", from May 18 to 24 to cover the Chinese climbing Qomolangma. Over the last century, the 8848-metre-high peak has proven a great challenge for mountaineers. Those who try to stand on top of the world do so at great risk from extremely cold, avalanches , and falling ice. At 8,500 meters, the air contains just one-third of the oxygen at sea level, requiring most climbers to use oxygen tanks. Some of those who climbed the mountain paid the highest price---175 people have lost their lives on the slopes. On May29, 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal became the first men ever to reach the top of the mountain. Nearly half a century later, the sons of the two pioneers, Peter Hillary and Jaming Tenzing Norgay, followed in their fathers' footsteps. In 2002, they also successfully reached the roof of the world. Over the last 60 years, more than 10,000 men and women have tried to climb the mountain and more than 1,200 have succeeded. The first Chinese climbers reached the top of the mountain in 1960. Despite the dangers, many different people are drawn towards the challenge. But why do they suffer such hardship and take such risks to climb Qomolangma? ""I don't think climbing the mountain is blindly risky. Instead, it's a chance to challenge oneself,"" said Chen Qi, a reporter of CCTV. Com, who was among May's mountaineering team. ""Only when you are surrounded by the mountain can you understand the love of nature and the true meaning of life."""

What's the new trend in archaeology right now according to Toivari-Viitala?	"The first field season is now over at the hut village of the workmen who built the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. However, the archaeologists working on the excavation have found that they still have a great deal to do. The sun, the wind and tourists have left their mark on the village, originally discovered by Bernard Bruyere in 1935. ""From our modern perspective, it is upsetting to see how the village was first excavated and then left to be destroyed. Passers-by have used the huts as rubbish dumps and restrooms,"" says Jaana Toivari-Viitala, a teacher at the University of Helsinki. ""Fortunately, while we still have some surface cleaning to do, conservation are off to a good start."" The hut village offers rare insight into everyday life in ancient Egypt. ""In the early twentieth century, archaeologists were only interested in the tombs of kings. The workmen's huts they discovered were seen as a necessary evil in the quest for the real treasures."" ""Now several international research groups on different excavations are examining everyday life and work in the Valley of the Kings. This seems to be a trend in archaeology right now,"" Toivari-Viitala says. Her research group wants to find out why the hut village was built on the slope of a mountain, halfway between the construction site and Deir-el-Medina. They are also interested in how many workers lived in the village at a time, when they lived there, and what their role was in the construction work. ""Comparing the names found in the village and in Deir-el-Medina provides useful information. Judging from the construction methods, settlement in the village can be divided into two separate periods: the initial settlement and a later one."" For the time being, much is up to guessing, but Toivari-Viitala believes that the coming four field seasons, three months each, will see results. ""The working conditions are not nearly as difficult as I thought they would be. The cool winds in the mountains nicely _ the heat."" The research group working on the ""Workmen's huts in the Theban mountains"" project is planning to return to the Valley of the Kings in October."

Which of the following passwords is considered the safest?	"Better think twice before choosing a _ for email, online bank or shopping. Simple passwords are easy to be stolen. A password is like a key to your home. If someone steals it, he'll get chances to steal something else. We use passwords everywhere in our life. We are so used to passwords that we don't pay any attention to them until we lose or forget one. A study of 28,000 passwords recently stolen from a popular website showed that people often do the easy thing. It found that 16% took a first name as a password. Another 14% used the easiest keyboard combinations such as ""12345678""or ""QWERTY"". 5% of the stolen passwords were names of television shows or stars popular with young people. 3% of the passwords expressed feelings like ""I don't care"", ""Whatever"", ""I love you"" or their opposite, ""I hate you"". Robert Graham, who did the study, advises people to choose a password that is longer than eight characters with one capital letter and one symbol. Of course, safe passwords don't mean those hard to remember. Forgetting your password is sometimes a big headache for you. Maybe, the perfect password is easy for you and hard for others. ,,."

Electronic equipment causes all the following problems except that _ .	Dear Editor; Why do newspapers carry so many advertisements for electronic equipment? Last Sunday I counted ads for seven kinds of televisions and thirteen kinds of radios in the Atlanta Journal. Besides that, there were pages and pages of ads for Citizens' Band radios and tape recorders. Don't you realize what electronic equipment is doing to our daily life? Everywhere you go you may hear loud musician advertisements over radios; this continual noise is ruining our ears. Husbands don't talk to wives any more; they are always watching the news or a ball game. Children ruin their eyes (not to mention their minds) with endless hours of watching not only the programs for children but those for grown-ups as well. And worse, hidden microphones find out about our private lives, and computers keep records of personal information about us. Enough is enough! I think you should limit the amount of advertising of electronic equipment in the Atlanta journal. Otherwise it will make life unbearable for us all.	['News of the world is given to all citizens']
"According to the passage,why are the Chinese unwilling to say ""I love you"" to parents?"	"Despite great affection for their parents,many Chinese people remain ""too shy"" to express love for them,according to an online survey. The poll of around 6,000 people,conducted by Beijing--based recruitment website Zhaopin.com,was conducted as the nation gears up (......)for Mother's Day on Sunday. Although 74.6 percent of participants said they knew their mothers' birthday,only 25.5 percent would like to actually tell her ""I love you"". ""This figure suggests mothers occupy an important place in most participants' mind. Yet,many people still find it 'embarrassing' to express their affection,"" the survey's organizer said. As to the form of celebration on Mother's Day,67 percent of participants said they would prepare some gifts,with 70 percent saying that they would spend no more than 500 yuan (74 US dollars),while 51 percent said they planned to phone their mother because they would either be too busy at work or be away from home. ""I do love my mother deeply but I have never said 'I love you' that often. It just feels quite weird for me to say it to her in person,""said Stella Wang,a 27yearold office worker,noting that she prefers to express her feelings in writing on birthday or Christmas cards. ""I have to say that it's difficult for me to express my love for my mother. I think if I did say it out loud,it might confuse her,"" said Liang Hao,a 32yearold engineer. ""Very few Chinese,at least those I know,are used to saying 'I love you',they may never even say it once,"" said Mike Denver,an American working in Shanghai as an English teacher. Hu Shoujun,a sociology professor from Shanghai's Fudan University said,""The personality of the Chinese people is generally quiet,reserved and serious. For Chinese,it's unnecessary and even regarded as 'odd' to display their affection for s and friends."""	['Because the personality of the Chinese people makes them not do it.']
What does the bookA View from the Zootalk about?	"Bringing a giraffe into the world is _ . A baby giraffe is born 10 feet high and usually lands on its back. Within seconds it rolls over its legs under its body. Then the mother giraffe rudely introduces its children to the reality of life. In his book,A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson. The mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling . When it doesn't get up, the process is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time on its shaky legs. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off its feet again. Why? She wants it to remember how it got up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety. Another writer named Irving Stone understood this. He spent a lifetime studying greatness, writing stories about such men as Michelangelo, Vincent van Gogh, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Darwin. Stone was once asked if he had found something that runs through the lives of all these great people. He said, ""I write about people who sometime in their life have a dream of something. They're beaten over the head, knocked down and for years they get nowhere. But every time they stand up again. And at the end of their lives they've realized some small parts of what they set out to do ."""	"[""A new-born giraffe's first lesson.""]"
Why did the professor hold the glass?	"A professor began his class by holding up a glass with some water in it. He held it up for all to see and asked the students, "" How much do you think this glass weighs?"" ""50 grams ! "" ""100 grams ! "" ""125 grams ! "" the students answered. ""I really don't know unless I weigh it , "" said the professor, "" but , my question is : What would happen if I held it up like this for a few minutes?"" "" Nothing , "" the students said. ""OK, what would happen if I held it up like this for an hour?"" the professor asked. ""Your arm would begin to ache, "" said one of the students. ""You are right, now what would happen if I held it up for a day?"" ""Your arm could go numb , and you might have to go to hospital, "" another student said. ""Very good ! But during all this, did the weight of the glass change?"" asked the professor. ""NO"" ""Then what made the arm ache and the muscle( ) stress?"" The students were puzzled. "" Put the glass down"" said one of the students. ""Exactly ! "" said the professor. "" Life's problems are something like this. Hold them for minutes in your head and they seem OK. Think of them for a long time and they begin to ache. Hold them even longer and they begin to trouble you. You will not be able to do anything. It's important to think of the problems in your life, but even more important to ' put them down' at the end of every day before you go to sleep. That way, you are not stressed; you wake up every day fresh and strong and can handle any issue, any challenge that comes your way ! "" ,."	['Because he wanted to explain something about life.']

What can we learn about the author's father?	"Following Christmas dinner,my family was relaxing around the kitchen table.The goodcooking smells still stayed.My sister,our chef, was enjoying the compliments.""Delicious meal!""""Everything was wonderful.""Dad had risen from his chair and was contentedly standing nearby. My nephew,never one to sit still for too long,began playing his new basketball around the table and throughout the kitchen.Upon nearing Dad,he stopped----almost uncertainly.With shaking,wrinkled hands,Dad had reached out for the ball.He did not speak,and the boy,confused,looked up and over at us.It took some convincing,but the ball was lightly passedover. I watched my father closely to see what he would do.A playful smile appeared on his face.Holding the ball and reaching forward,Dad bounced it on the floor then caught it.This action was repeated.Nodding approvingly,he then turned towards our assembled group.Gently throwing the ball away,Dad began a game of catch. The ball continued to be passed though eager pairs of outstretched hands.Cries of""Over here!""rang through the warm kitchen.Dad's active participation in this game was remarkable to me,since he had advanced Alzheimer's disease.This disease had robbed him of many memories and the recognition of people,places mid points in time. In my younger years,playing with Dad was rare.To his credit,Dad worked hard and provided for us.He was very private and never showed nor shared much emotion.His game of choice was chess,which he did eventually teach me how to play.As an adult,I had become a caregiver and watched helplessly as Dad declined.Connecting moments between father and son had been few and far before he took the basketball. I'm not sure how long we played catch.What I do know is that our game ended all too soon,and it was time to face the reality of dirty dishes piled high on countertops.The moment,though,will certainly last forever.On this Christmas,Dad gave me a special memory--one that I will always treasure."

What made people regard Shakespeare as a Dick Whittington figure?	"The world shares him and London claims him, but Stratford-on-Avon intends to spend 2016 celebrating Shakespeare as their man: the bard of Avon, who was born there in 1564, and died there 400 years ago. Stratford remained hugely important throughout Shakespeare's life, argues Paul Edmondson, the head of learning and research at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. ""People have seen Shakespeare as a Dick Whittington figure, who turns his back on Stratford and his family, goes to London to earn his fortune and only comes back to die,"" he said. ""But Stratford is where he bought land and property, where he kept his library, where he lived and read and thought. We are going to spend the year re-emphasizing the importance of Shakespeare, the man of Stratford."" The anniversary of the death of the most famous and the most performed playwright in the world will be marked across Britain and the globe. Macbeth is about to open in Singapore, Romeo and Juliet in Brussels. Shakespeare's Globe is completing the first world tour, in which it has taken Hamlet to almost every country. North Korea is still holding out, though. The Globe director recently jokily claimed Shakespeare as a true Londoner. Stratford, however, will be insisting that the town made and educated Shakespeare. ""His old school room in Stratford-on-Avon where Shakespeare learned 'small Latin and less Greek' --as kindly laughed at by his friend Ben Johnson--will open its doors, scarred by centuries of naughty schoolboys, to mark 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death,"" said Paul Edmondson. Shakespeare bought the splendid New Place, the second best house in the town, when he had made his fortune on the London stage. ""You don't buy a house like New Place and not live there,"" Paul said. He believes that after Shakespeare bought it, all his thinking time was spent there, and that the late plays, including The Tempest, were at least planned in his library and probably written there."

Jenny's mum got the phone call from _ .	I'm Jenny. Nothing is cuter than my dog, Marley. He sleeps near my bed at night and gives me kisses every morning. He gets sad when I leave for school. But he's always there waiting when I get home., ready to go for a walk or play a game. On a Christmas Eve , Marley walked with my family to a store. My mum tied him up outside. When we came out of the store, Marley had gone. My mum called the police to report that he had been stolen. We couldn't find him anywhere. I was very sad. It was the worst Christmas Eve ever. That night, I didn't sleep well. My cat seemed to know I was sad and hugged me to make me feel better. On Christmas morning, I woke up and called for Marley. Then I remembered that he had gone. Even though it was Christmas, I didn't want presents. I didn't want anything, except my friend. Then my mum got a phone call. Someone found him!

The man chose to buy the red and long fruit only because _ .	"Long long ago a man went to India and he had never been there before. When he got there, he saw a lot of fruit, but much of it was expensive because they couldn't grow much because there was little water. Finally he saw a big basket of some very red and long fruit. And it was the cheapest in the shop. So he went up and asked, ""How much each kilo?""and the shop keeper said, ""Two rupees . ""Two rupees in India was nothing. So he bought a whole kilogram of the fruit and started eating it. But after he ate some of it:oh, my god!His eyes watered, his mouth watered and burnt, and his face became red. He jumped up and down, saying, ""Ah!Ah!Ah!"" But he still continued to eat the fruit!Some people who were looking at him shook their heads and said, ""You're crazy, man. Those are chilies !You can't eat so many!People use them as a _ , but only a little bit to put into food for taste. You can't just eat them like that. ""But the silly man said, ""No, I can't stop!I paid money for them, and now I'll eat them up. It's my money!"" And you think that man was silly, right?We sometimes do a lot of things like that. We spend money, time or effort doing something. And even though it's been a long time, hard experience tells us it won't work, and we know there's no more hope, we still continue just because we've put money, time, effort and love in to it. Just like the man who ate the chilies and felt so bad but couldn't stop because he didn't want to waste the money he'd paid. So even if you've lost something, let it go and move on. That's better than continuing to lose."	['it was cheap']
If you stay at a five-star hotel in Kuala Lumpur, how much will you pay the porter at least?	"The porter brings your bags to your room and helpfully explains all you want to know.Then he points to the phone and says:""If there's anything else you need, just call.""All this time you have been thinking of one thing:""How much should I tip him?"" To make your next trip a little easier, here's guide to tipping across some Asian countries. Bangkok In general, the more westernized the place is, the more likely you will be expected to leave a tip.Some top-end restaurants will add a 10% service charge to the bill.If not, waiters will appreciate your tacking on the 10% yourself.However, if you're eating at a lower-end restaurant, a tip is not necessary.If you're staying at one of Bangkok's many five-star hotels, expect to tip the porter 20 to 50 baht ,depending on how many bags you have.Taxis are now metered in Bangkok.Local custom is to round up the fare to the nearest five baht. Hong Kong Tipping is customary in this money-mad metropolis .Most restaurants add a 10% service charge to the bill, but the extra money often ends up in the pocket of the owner. If the service is good, add another 10% to the bill, up to HKMYMl00 in an especially nice restaurant.For HK MYM10 hotel porters should do it at all but the nicest hotels where a new HKMYM20 bill may be more acceptable.When in a taxi, round up to the nearest dollar. Kuala Lumpur Tipping in Malaysia is limited to the expensive westernized hotels, which often add a 10% service charge to your meal or hotel room.If you are at a hotel restaurant, expect a 10% service charge. But at local restaurants, there's no need to add a tip. At five-star hotels, one or two ringgit will satisfy a porter. At lower-end buildings don't feel you have to tip Like Bangkok, many taxis are now metered so you can just round up to the nearest ringgit. Seoul Tipping is not part of Korean culture, although it has become a matter of course in international hotels where a 10% service charge is often added.If you're at a Korean barbecue joint , there's no need to add anything extra.But a nice Italian restaurant may require a 10% contribution. If you're at a top-end hotel, so expect to pay 500~l,000 won per bag.Taxi drivers don't accept a tip.Keep the change for yourself."	['One ringgit']
What is this passage mainly about?	"""Everybody in this city wants a car, and I'm no exception. A car brings with it the freedom to travel"", said a friend of mine while reading a car magazine. I might not agree with him, but no doubt he was speaking for a rapidly growing number of middle-class Chinese. While it is true that all the waiting, walking, being part of a crowd, and sweating, are somewhat unpleasant, there are many problems which can arise when our lives rely too much on this invention. First of all, in terms of polluting the environment, driving a car is the worst act an average person can _ . Beijing now finds itself at the top of the list of the most polluted capital cities in the world with Mexico City in the second place. Research also shows that by 2010 around 90% of total pollutants in Shanghai have come from cars. These pollutions are extremely dangerous to our health. They can damage the lungs, cause cancer, and damage the brain. Apart from environmental problems, relying too much on cars also creates social problems such as traffic jams, road accidents, and noise pollution. The jeeps that proudly drive through the Hutongs in Beijing as if they are in a race often annoy me, and to make it worse, these drivers seldom respect cyclists. Of course, we cannot forget the convenience that cars bring us when we need to travel far, but I often find it faster to cycle from one place to another within the city of Beijing, especially with the growing traffic jams. Since people travel further and more frequently than before, cars will certainly be important in the future. At the same time, however, let us work hard to make sure that this invention brings us a more convenient lifestyle rather than trouble and disease. Let us make good use of cars."

The passage inicates that Mrs. Johnson was the best know for _	"Lady Bird Johnson was born Claudia Alta Taylor in nineteen twelve. The Taylor family lived in the small town of Karnack, Texas. Claudia's father, Thomas Jefferson Taylor, owned two stores as well as thousands of hectares for cotton production. Her mother, Minnie Taylor, died when Claudia was only five years old. A woman who worked for the Taylor family gave Claudia her nickname. Alice Tittle said the small child was ""as purty as a lady bird."" As first lady, Missus Johnson became an energetic activist for educational and environmental issues. She helped support Head Start, a public program aimed at giving educational and health services to young children from poor families. She started the Society for a More Beautiful National Capitol. Its aim was to improve the beauty of Washington by planting trees and flowers in public areas and parks. Missus Johnson understood that these improvements were also linked to important issues such as pollution, public transportation, mental health, and crime rates. Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson had a difficult four-year term. The president faced strong opposition about the United States involvement in the war in Vietnam. In nineteen sixty-eight, President Johnson surprised the nation by announcing that he would not seek reelection as president. The Johnsons left politics and returned home to Texas. Mister Johnson died of a heart attack in nineteen seventy-three. Lady Bird Johnson continued her tireless work to improve the country's natural environment. She created the National Wildflower Research Center in nineteen eighty-two. The center helps to educate people about the environmental importance and value of native plants. Missus Johnson died in two thousand seven at the age of ninety-four. Her memory lives in the many fields of wildflowers that color the roads of America."

She soon became a star. Her first albumOver the Rainbowsold very well. She won many awards. ""You wouldn't believe such a beautiful voice could come from such a small body,"" said one musician after hearing Chang sing. ""She has a special voice. You can't forget it."" But the 25-year-old girl has other talents too. Chang is also an actress. She has played a role in the popular TV plays, My MVP ValentineandAt Dolphin Bay. Many people remember her common-girl parts in the plays. But acting is difficult. Chang once acted so badly that she was nearly fired . Another time it took her 27 tries to get a scene right. ""I cried when I got back home,"" Chang said. ""But I knew that I wouldn't always fail. You only fail when you give up.""

The air in Guozijian is fragrant because _ .	Tranquility, relaxation and the scent of incense , this is Guozijian Street, a street combining Beijing's past and present. Housing the Confucian Temple in the east and the Imperial College in the west, the street gradually took shape some 700 years ago. Guozijian Street connects to the Lama Temple in the east. There are many sandalwood incense shops at the street entrance. The air is full of scent. Yet gradually, the scent of ancient books takes advantage as one explores further down the street and towards the Confucian Temple and Imperial College. The Confucian Temple is where the worships to Confucius were attended during the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties (1271-1911). Gnarled cypress trees outside the gate create thick shade from the sun. On each side of the gate stands a huge stone pole written in Mandarin and Mongolian ordering all horse riders, even the emperor, to get off their horses. The glazed yellow tiles on the roof show the temple's past dignity. Beside the Confucian Temple is the Imperial College, the highest educational institution during the Yuan, Ming and Qing Dynasties, which was once the dream destination for ancient scholars. The neighboring Guanshuyuan Hutong is no different than other Beijing hutongs, except for its unique color1s. The royal red of the Imperial College wall is a stark contrast with the typical grey of common people's residences. Serenity is very common over Guozijian Street. The occasional noise aroused by visitors is quickly absorbed by the quiet atmosphere. Even time slows down on this ancient street. The leafy and green cypress trees along the street protect it from the bother of the busy city. These tall and silent plants add to the dignity and elegance of the street. Living houses still preserve the ancient and attractive style of old Beijing, which is hardly seen elsewhere nowadays. Looking through the red gate where the paint has already started to come off, one may find some older people sitting leisurely in the sun in the courtyards. It seems that living next door to the sage has brought them the wisdom to dismiss all kinds of worries.	['incenses in the shop and ancient books give off lots of scent']
It is probably most difficult for Smarter Child to_.	"To what degree can a computer achieve intelligence?The answer to this question may lie in a newly-developed US computer program called Smarter Child and the Internet. If you ran into Smarter Child online, you would be surprised at this kid's huge memory. It can recite many facts. For example, Smarter Child knows every baseball player in every team this season. He knows every word in the dictionary and the weather in every major city areas across the US. However, if you ask Smarter Child other questions, you get strange answers. A question about Smarter Child's age returns, ""One year, 11 days, 16 hours, 7 minutes, and 47 seconds!"" Asking where he lives gets, ""In a clean room in a high-tech building in California."" Smarter Child uses the vast information on the World Wide Web as his memory bank. To answer questions about spelling, for instance, Smarter Child goes to American Heritage Dictionary online. For the weather, he visits www.intellicast.com. Some scientists believe that by joining the many systems of the Internet, an artificial being with the combined knowledge of, say, Albert Einstein, Richard Nixon and Britney Spears could be born. However, if Smarter Child wants to think and learn on his own like the boy-computer David in the movie A. I. Artificial Intelligence, he must solve two problems. The first is that computers find it difficult to read web pages because the files are sorted in different ways. That's why programmers need to tell Smarter Child where to look for the weather. It would be a much more difficult task to let him find it himself. Another problem is that while Smarter Child can process information more exactly and faster than any human, he lacks common sense--a basic grounding of knowledge that is obvious to any young child."

What will you do with mistakes when you speak?	Swimming and English Learning Can you swim? Do you like swimming? Yes? Well, how can you learn to swim? I think the best way is to go into the water and learn. I'm afraid you'll never learn to swim just by reading books about swimming or looking at others swimming. It's the same with the English study. We must practice, practice and practice. Listening and speaking are very important for beginners. The children in English-speaking countries first listen to others. Then they try to imitate and speak. We can listen to English programs on radio. You may just understand a few words. It doesn't matter. Just be relaxed, try to catch every word. Somebody may be a good listener. But he dare not speak. He's afraid of making mistakes. You know we sometimes make mistakes when we speak Chinese. Don't be afraid. We must be brave. If you really want to learn English well, you must try to speak with everyone so long as he knows English. Whether you know him or not is not important when there's nobody to talk with, you can talk to yourself in English. It's interesting and also a good way to practice your spoken English. Remember, the more you speak, the fewer mistakes you'll make. Reading and writing are more important for senior school students. First we must choose the books we're interested in. A lot of reading will improve your language sense. This is the most important. Keep writing English diaries. We can also write English articles. You may even post them to English magazines. Don't be afraid of failure. Failure is the mother of success. Easier said than done. Well, let's do more practice from now on. I'm sure you'll learn English well in this way.	"[""Don't be afraid.""]"
It can be inferred from the reading that Nicholas Clapp is _	"Before Nicholas Clapp got there, he had half hoped that he might run into some of Ubar's ruins sticking out of the sand. But finding the city wasn't that easy. During the summer, he and his 40 helpers dug at 35 different spots. The only things they found were ground spiders, giant ticks, and deadly snakes. Just before Thanksgiving says Clapp, _ But then Clapp's team looked at the high-tech maps again and saw something surprising. Many of the caravan routes on the high-tech maps came together on the same spot marked ""Omani Marketplace"" on Ptolomy's map. Two maps, made almost 2000 years apart, pointed the team toward the same area! In December 1991, Clapp arrived at the spot where, according to the maps, the caravans met. Clapp had a handheld instrument that could detect objects below the ground. It showed ruins under the sand! He and his team started digging. And then they found it! A tower buried in the sand. They slowly unearthed a giant, eight-sided fortress . It had nine towers and many rooms. People had lived in this fortress 2000 years ago. Outside its walls, they had found buried remains of nearly 40 campsites. They seemed to be camping areas for traders . More digging found shards, or pieces of pottery from ancient Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and Syria. Diggers and scientists agree that people were here for about 5000 years. Clapp and his team were excited as they continued to discover more pieces of the past that seemed to prove that it was the lost city of Ubar. ""We started with this hopeless myth ,"" says Clapp, ""and then finally found the truth behind the myth."" But is this unearthed site really the once-great Ubar? Experts aren't totally persuaded. Donald Whitcomb is an archeologist at the University of Chicago. He doubts that Clapp really discovered Ubar. ""There's probably some truth to this myth,"" he says. ""But Ubar is described as a place with walls all made of gold, and the rubies and emeralds ."" No gold or precious stones have been found by Clapp. ""I'm not sure whether they discovered Ubar because I'm not sure if Ubar really existed,"" Whitcomb says."	['a person of determination']

It can be inferred from the text that _ .	"On my first day of work at Moro Assurance, I arrived nervously, totally wet and nearly half an hour late. I had forgotten to take an umbrella, had missed the bus and was mow ready for a good scolding . It was then that I met Nicky Jonathan, the Managing Director. She was a small, birdlike woman. Her appearance gave others the impression of a nervous, easily-flustered person. I soon learnt, however, that her true character was calm, warm and kind, yet very professional. After reminding me that lateness would not be tolerated in the office, she laughingly admitted to me that she had been over an hour late in her first morning because she had lost her way, which was typical of her. After a wet, awful morning, this kind office manager led me to my seat; yet her kindness and super ability didn't stop surprising me there. During the years I worked with her, my admiration for Nicky steadily increased. Her ability to deal with several matters at once seemed almost miraculous . I remembered one occasion when nearly everyone in the office had gone down with the flu, yet Nicky managed to keep the office running smoothly without seeming stressed. The most striking thing about Nicky was her understanding towards others. _ If she sensed that something was wrong, she would call you into her office and encourage you to talk. Not only was she a good listener, but the advice she offered was always sound as well. All in all, Nicky is the most admirable person I've ever mer. I will always remember her as the ""guiding light"" in my working life."	['Nicky may have given the author many useful suggestions']
Which of the following is TRUE?	You can't see any object unless light from that object gets into your eyes.Some of the things you see give off light of their own. The sun,the stars,a lighted lamp are the examples that can be seen by their own light.But most of the things you see are not giving off light of their own.They are just reflecting light that falls on them from the sun or some other luminous bodies.The moon,for example,doesn't give off any light of its own.It is not 1uminous.You see it because sunlight falls on it and some of the sunlight reflects on the earth.So moonlight is only second--hand sunlight. When you look at a book,it sends some of the light which fails on it to your eyes,and you see the book.If light could be kept out from where you're so that there would be no light from the book to reflect.Then you couldn't see the book even with your eyes wide open.Light travels so fast that the time in which it travels from the book you're reading to your eyes is as short as if there were no time at time.Light reaches us from the moon,which is about 380,000 kilometres away,in only a little more than a second.

The passage mainly talks about _ .	Most people graduate from school and then get a job. Everyone wants a job that pays well. How much money can you make? Ask yourself these questions: What can I do? What skills do I have? Also ask yourself: How much education do I have? For most jobs, the higher your education, the higher your earning power. In the United States, high school graduates make about $18,600 a year. If you do not finish high school, you make only $10,800 a year. You can make $7,800 more each year by staying in high school! If you stay in school, then you can make more money. A person with a high school degree makes about $18,600 a year. If that person goes to college and gets a bachelor's degree , he can make $42,000. With a master's degree , he can make about $53,000. If the person gets a PhD , he can make almost $79,000 or more a year. We can learn a very important thing from this information. If you want to work and make more money, get a good education.	['how education and pay are connected']

Which of the following is NOT mentioned as a common element of theater and ritual?	"There are many theories about the beginning of drama in ancient Greece. The one most widely accepted today is based on the assumption that drama came from ritual . The argument for this view goes as follows. In the beginning, human beings viewed the natural forces of the world, even the seasonal changes, as unpredictable, and they sought through various means, to control these unknown and feared powers. Those measures which appeared to bring the desired results were then kept and repeated until they hardened into fixed rituals. Eventually stories arose which explained the mysteries of the rites. As time passed some rituals were abandoned, but the stories, later called myths , coutinued to exist and provided material for art and drama. Those who believe that drama came from ritual also argue that those rites contained the seed of theater because music, dance, masks, and costumes were almost always used. Furthermore, a suitable site had to be provided for performances and when the entire community did not participate, a clear division was usually made between the ""acting area"" and the ""watching area."" In addition, there were performers, and, since considerable importance was attached to avoiding mistakes in performing, religious leaders usually undertook that task. Wearing masks and costumes, they often imitated other people, animals, or supernatural beings, and used gestures about the desired effect, success in hunt or battle, the coming rain, the revival of the Sun. Eventually such dramatic representations were separated from religious activities. Another theory traces the theater's origin from the human interest in storytelling. According to this view, tales about the hunt, war, or other feats are gradually added in detail, at first through imitation, action, and dialogue by a narrator and then through the assumption of each of the roles by a different person. A closely-related theory traces theater to those dances that are primarily rhythmical and gymnastic or that are imitations of animal movements and sounds."	['Magic.']

The passage is mainly about _ .	"1826, a Frenchman named Niepce needed pictures for his business .But he was not a good artist.So he invented a very simple camera .He put it in a window of his house and took a picture of his garden .That was the first photo. The next important date in the history of photography was 1837. That year, Daguerre, another Frenchman, took a picture of his studio. He used a new kind of camera and a different processs. In his pictures, you could see everything very clearly, even the smallest details. This kind of photograph was called a daguerreotype. Soon, other people began to use Daguerre's process. Travellers brought back daguerreotypes from all around the world. People photographed famous buildings, cities and mountains. In about 1840, the process was improved. Now photographers could take pictures of people and moving things. The process was not simple. The photographers had to carry lots of film and processing equipment. But this did not stop the photographers, especially in the United States, where from the 1840s daguerreotype artists were popular in most cities. Mathew Brady was a well-known American photographer. He took many pictures of famous people. The pictures were unusual because they were very life-like and full of personality. Brady was also the first person to take pictures of war. His 1862 Civil War pictures showed dead soldiers and ruined cities. They made the war seem more real and more terrible In the 1880s, new inventions began to change photography. Photographers could buy film readymade in rolls. So they did not have to make the film immediately. They could bring it back to their studios and develop it later, meaning that they did not have to carry lots of equipment. And finally, the invention of the small handheld camera made photography less expensive. With the small camera, anyone could be a photographer. People began to use cameras just for fun. They took pictures of their families, friends and favourite places. They called these pictures ""snapshots"". Photographs became very popular in newspapers in the 1890s. Soon magazines and books also used documentary photographs. These pictures showed true events and people. They were much more real than drawings. Photography had turned into a form of art by the beginning of the 20th century. Some photographs were not just copies of the real world. They showed ideas and feelings, like other art forms."

What happened to John after getting in touch with Miss Hollis Maynell?	"John Blanchard was studying the crowd making their way through the station. He was looking for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn' t, the girl with the rose. When reading a book in a Florida library a year before, John became interested not in the contents of the book, but in the notes penciled in the margin . The handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and beautiful mind. He discovered the former owner' s name in the front of the book: Miss Hollis Maynell. He located her address and wrote a letter introducing himself. The next day he was shipped overseas to serve in the army. During the next year, they grew to know each other through the mail and their friendship developed. John requested a photograph, but she refused, saying if he really cared, it wouldn' t matter what she looked like. When the day finally came for him to return home, their first meeting was suggested--7:00 pm. at the Grand Central Station in New York. She wrote,"" You' ll recognize me by the red rose I wear on my coat. ""So now John was in the station to meet the girl with a rose. As a pretty and slim girl in green came over, John noticed her blue eyes like flowers in spring. He walked directly towards her , entirely forgetting she was not wearing a rose. As John came closer to her, he saw another woman with a red rose stood nearby. Well past 40, this woman had graying hair done under a worn hat. Seeing the girl in green walk quickly away, John felt as if he were split in two. He desired to follow that girl, but longed for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned and supported him. The woman looked gentle and sensible. John went to her, saying, ""1' m Captain John Blanchard. You must be Miss Maynell. I am glad to meet you here. May I take you to dinner?"" She replied with a smile, I don' t know what this is about. But the lady in green who just went by, begged me to wear this rose on my coat. She said if you asked me out to dinner, l' d tell you she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!"""	['He began to serve the army abroad.']

On that day, I hurried to my science class in the morning and found a seat in the back. I waited there for 15 minutes before the bell rang. The science teacher told us about some class rules. No one talked to me nor did I talk to anyone else. I was one of those very shy girls. After the science class, I had an English class. I thought it would be boring but it turned out to be very funny. When the classes of the morning ended I went to lunch. I sat outside the dining room with no one to talk to and no food because I was too nervous to join the lunch line. I kept looking around hoping to see someone I knew but I never saw anyone. Lunch ended and I went to have my art class. I was the first one there and not even my teacher was there yet. So I sat at my desk and started drawing some pictures. I didn't notice the rest of the class walking in or the girl that was standing behind me till I surprised by the voice, ""So what are you drawing?"" It was a girl who had really long hair. She ended up being my best friend and one of the kindest and liveliest girls I know. In the next class meeting, the teacher asked us to talk about the past holiday. I was glad to make some new friends in the class. The first day of high school was hard for me but I got through it."	['She learned some class rules.']

Which of the following can be the best title of the passage?	We know music is very important in our daily life. Today most stores, stations, restaurants and other places play music. Do you notice music playing at any of these places when you go somewhere? You might even hear music in an office or on a farm. Scientists believe that music influences the way people behave. They think that the sound of western classical music makes people feel richer. When a restaurant plays classical music, people spend more money on food and drinks. When the restaurant plays modern music, people spend less money. Without music, people spend even less. Scientists also believe that loud, fast music makes people eat faster. Some restaurants play fast music during meal time. This makes people eat faster and leave quickly. Restaurants can make more money in this way. Some scientists think that music makes you think and learn better. They say that music helps students to be more active. It is true that people learn better when they are relaxed. And listening to music can help you relax. Next time you hear music somewhere, be careful. It might influence the way you do things.	['Music and Behavior']
_ shows that you're not angry.	Anger is a kind of feeling. Many things can make you angry. When your teacher gives you too much homework, when your team loses an important game, when a friend borrows your favorite thing and then breaks it, you may get really angry. Usually, your body will tell you when you are angry. For example, you breathe faster, your face turns red, and you may want to break something or hit someone, but sometimes, you hide your anger. For example, you may hide it in your heart. The problem is that if you do this, you may get a headache or your stomach may hurt. In fact, it's not good to hide your anger, and it's normal for you to get angry sometimes. But anger must be let out in the right way, without hurting others or yourself. When you get angry, you can talk about it with other people. It's helpful to talk about your anger with an adult, such as parents, a teacher, etc. When you talk about anger, those bad feelings can start to go away. Here are some other things you can do when you start to feel angry: talk to a good friend; count from 1 to 100; give someone a hug ; go for a bike ride; think about good things, etc. Remember that how you act when you are angry can make everything better or worse. Don't let your anger you.	['Wanting to protect someone']
What is said about the children in the Albinas in the passage?	"The Albinas married when Mr. Albina was 30, and they spent the early marriage in Argentina. Then they decided to move to Chile, which meant they had to cross the Andes Mountains. They and their 20s sons made the difficult two-week journey on horses. One night there was a terrible snow storm in the mountains, during which Mrs Albina gave birth to triplets , a boy and two girls. Mrs Albina now has 30 more girls, including the twins who are 15 months old. The oldest Albina children are in their 30s and 40s. They are on their own now, but 18 of the kids still live with their parents in a two-room house. The house has electricity but no toilet or running water. Clearly, the Albinas don't have enough money and food for the big family. Why, then, do they continue to have children? The Albinas do not use birth control because it is against their religion. They can let other people take care of their kids, but Mrs Albina doesn't allow it. ""When we were babies,"" she said, ""our mother left us at an orphanage and never returned. Then a couple adopted my brothers, and I was left behind. I was heartbroken. I promised that when I became a mother I would never give my children away."" So the Albina family continues to grow. They have so many kids that they run out of names and have to give some children the same name. There are three Susannas, three Miriams, two Estrellas, and two Soledades. Will the family stop at 53 kids? Mr Albina is 77, and Mrs Albina is 59. ""I am getting old,"" she said with a smile, ""and I would like God to think of me and consider my age. But if God sends more children to me, yes, there will be more."""	['Most of the children are independent now.']

Which of the following can be inferred from the text?	"The teacher was leaving the village, and everybody seemed sorry. The miller lent him the small cart and horse to carry his goods to Christminster, the city of his destination. Such a vehicle proved of quite enough size of the teacher's belongings, for his only article, in addition to the packing-case of books, was a piano that he had bought when he thought of learning instrumental music. But the eagerness having faded, he had never acquired the skill of playing, and the purchased article had been a permanent trouble to him. The headmaster had gone away for the day, being a man who disliked the sight of changes. He didn't mean to return till the evening, when the new teacher would have arrived, and everything would be smooth again. The blacksmith, the carpenter and the teacher were standing in confused attitudes in the sitting room before the instrument. The teacher had remarked that even if he got it into the cart he should not know what to do with it on his arrival at Christminster, since he was only going into a temporary place just at first. A little boy of eleven, who had been assisting in the packing, joined the group of men, and said, ""Aunt has got a fuel-house, and it could be put there, perhaps, till you've found a place to settle in, sir."" ""Good idea,"" said the blacksmith. The smith and the carpenter started to see about possibility of the suggested shelter, and the boy and the teacher were left standing alone. ""Sorry I am going, Jude?"" asked the latter kindly. Tears rose into the boy's eyes. He admitted that he was sorry. ""So am I,"" said the teacher. He continued, ""Well---don't speak of this everywhere. You know what a university is, and a university degree? It is the necessary hallmark of a man who want to do anything in teaching. My plan, or dream, is to be a university graduate. By going to Christminster, I shall be at headquarters , so to speak, and if my plan is practical at all, I consider that being on the spot will afford me a better chance."" The smith and his companion returned. Old Miss Fawly's fuel-house was big enough, and she seemed willing to give the instrument standing-room there. So it was left in the school till the evening, when more hands would be available for removing it; and the teacher gave a final glance round."	['The teacher was torn between the eagerness to go to the city and his love for the village.']
Who is this speech probably given to?	Students who want to attend an American university must explain how they will pay for their education. They have to show that they will be able to pay for each year of study. Students have to consider not only the tuition, the cost of classes, but also meals and a place to live in, which is known as room-and-board. They also need money for books and supplies. And they need money to spend on social activities and other things. Educational advisers say foreign students should have enough money in a local bank to pay for at least two months of expenditure . So how much will a year at an American school cost? Generally speaking, the answer is: a lot. A leading state university in the Pacific Northwest will serve as an example. The University of Washington says foreign students are paying more than $36,000 this year. This major research university currently has 2,600 foreign students from more than 100 countries. There are many schools that cost less, but also others that cost more. Its web site says the University of Washington does not offer financial assistance to international students. This is generally true of American schools, especially at the undergraduate level. The international application for the university includes a Statement of Financial Responsibility that must be signed. Students must also provide a bank letter or statement from within the past six months. And they have to name someone who will help with payments. These people must send proof from a bank to show that they have the money. Your government or employer may be able to help you pay all or some of the college costs. A good idea is to ask at least eighteen months before you want to start classes in the United States. Our Foreign Student Services, including links to web sites discussed in our reports, can be found at www.unsv.com. To learn more about higher education in America, the State Department has a special web site: educationusa.state.gov.	['Students who are going to college in the US.']
How did Tim come to know Timothy Sykes?	While in college, Tim started to look for easy ways to make money. One of the opportunities he saw was gambling . He started learning about all forms of gambling. He got lucky enough to make $9,000, but sadly it didn't last long and over the next year he lost all of that money. It was at this point that Tim realized that he needed to stop gambling and focus on learning about finance. One day, he was talking to one of his friends about creating a business, and his friend turned him onto Quick Sprout. So he started reading every blog post on Quick Sprout in the hope that he could learn about how to become a successful businessman and meet some people through Quick Sprout that he could partner up with. A year ago Tim read a blog post on Quick Sprout about another businessman by the name of Timothy Sykes. Tim visited Timothysykes.com and learned about his Millionaire Challenge program that taught people how to buy and sell penny stocks . Tim thought it would be worth giving a try. Tim spent the next few months learning from Timothy Sykes on how to trade stocks. After he felt that he had learned enough, he wanted to start trading. Within the first 6 months of using what he learned in the Millionaire Challenge program, he made over $40,000. At one point he even made $11,000 in 15 minutes. Over the next 12 months Tim is on track to make even more money. So far things are looking good and he is already ahead of schedule. The Millionaire Challenge program has worked out so well for him and he is now starting to enjoy the finer things of life.	['By visiting a website by chance.']

When you meet a stop line while driving a car in the crossing without traffic lights,, _ .	In America: There are many more cars than in China. Maybe the number of cars in California is the same as the number in China. But there are fewer traffic jams and accidents in America than in China. We hardly see traffic police in the street, but all cars obey traffic rules strictly , and people hardly find that a car does not obey traffic rules in the street. About America traffic rules, there are many better terms , such as: 1. Stop line: There are stop line in all crossing without traffic lights(some have two stop lines and others have four stop lines); all cars must stop while meeting the stop lines. 2.Traffic lights: There are traffic lights in the crossing of the road .Cars may almost turn every direction. the traffic lights can give signals step by step including u-turn . There is a kind of middle lane of turning left. When a car wants to turn left in the road, he may enter into the middle lane of turning left and give a signal of turning left. When he thinks being safe he may turn left. 3. Specific item: Such as parking, there are three kinds of lines (its color are white, blue or red) in the roadside. Every line may park different kinds of cars. There are streets in some residential areas, and no car can park at any time or any period time. 4. About the priority of passengers and cars: At any case, passengers have the priority to cars. But only after passengers have passed the road and gotten the top of sidestep, cars may go ahead. In general, traffic rules of America are very specific, convenient and safe.	['you must stop']

What did Kate decide to do?	"Suddenly another thought went through Kate's mind like an electric shock. An express train was due to go past about thirty minutes later. If it were not stopped, that long train, full of passengers, would fall into the stream. ""Someone must go to the station and warn the station-master,"" Kate thought. But who was to go? She would have to go herself. There was no one else. In wind and rain she started on her difficult way. Soon she was at the bridge that crossed the Des Moines River, a bridge also built of wood, just like the bridge across Honey Creek. The storm had not washed this away, but there was no footpath across it. She would have to cross it by stepping from sleeper to sleeper. With great care she began the dangerous crossing, sometimes on her hands and knees, hardly daring to look down between the sleepers into the wild flood waters below. If she should slip, she would fall between the sleepers, into the rapidly flowing stream. At last -- she never knew how long it had taken her -- she felt solid ground under her feet. But there was no time to rest. She still had to run more than half a mile and had only a few minutes left. Unless she reached the station before the express did, many, many lives would be lost. She did reach the station just as the train came into sight. Fortunately the station-master was standing outside. ""The bridge is down! Stop the train! Oh, please stop it!"" Kate shouted breathlessly. The station-master went pale. He rushed into the station building and came back with a signal light. He waved the red light as the train came into the station.

She had written letters to the local paper, even to a national, protesting about a projected by-pass to her village, and, looking at a map, the route was nowhere near where she lived and it wasn't as if the area was attractive. I was more than puzzled, I was curious. The enquiry into the route of the new by-pass to the village was due to take place shortly, and I wanted to know what it was that motivated her. So it was that I found myself knocking on a cottage door, being received by Mary Smith and then being taken for a walk to the woods. ""I've always loved this place,"" she said, ""it has a lot of memories for me, and for others. We all used it. They called it 'Lovers lane'. It's not much of a lane, and it doesn't go anywhere important, but that's why we all came here. To be away from people, to be by ourselves. "" she added. It was indeed pleasant that day and the songs of many birds could be heard. Squirrels watched from the branches, quite bold in their movements, obviously few people passed this way and they had nothing to fear. I could imagine the noise of vehicles passing through these peaceful woods when the by-pass was built, so _ but as I hold strong opinions about the needs of the community over-riding the opinions of private individuals, I said nothing. The village was quite a dangerous place because of the traffic especially for old people and children, their safety was more important to me than an old woman's strange ideas. ""Take this tree,"" she said pausing after a short while. ""To you it is just that, a tree. Not unlike many others here."" She gently touched the bark, ""Look here, under this branch, what can you see?"" ""It looks as if someone has done a bit of carving with a knife."" I said after a cursory inspection. ""Yes, that's what it is!"" she said softly. She went on, ""He had a penknife with a spike for getting stones from a horse's hoof, and I helped him to carve them. We were very much in love, but he was going away, and could not tell me what he was involved in the army. I had guessed of course. It was the last evening we ever spent together, because he went away the next day, back to his Unit."" Mary Smith was quiet for a while, then she sobbed. ""His mother showed me the telegram. 'Sergeant R Holmes ...Killed in action in the invasion of France.'..."" ""I had hoped that you and Robin would one day get married."" she said, ""He was my only child, and I would have loved to be a Granny, they would have been such lovely babies'- she was like that! "" ""Two years later she too was dead. 'Pneumonia , following a chill on the chest' was what the doctor said, but I think it was an old fashioned broken heart. A child would have helped both of us."" There was a further pause. Mary Smith gently caressed the wounded tree, just as she would have caressed him. ""And now they want to take our tree away from me."" Another quiet sob, then she turned to me. ""I was young and pretty then, I could have had anybody, I wasn't always the old woman you see here now. I had everything I wanted in life, a lovely man, health and a future to look forward to."" She paused again and looked around. The breeze gently moved through the leaves with a sighing sound. ""There were others, of course, but no one can match my Robin!"" she said strongly. ""And now I have nothing - except the memories this tree holds. If only I could get my hands on that awful man who writes in the paper about the value of the road they are going to build where we are standing now, I would tell him. Has he never loved, has he never lived, does he not know anything about memories? We were not the only ones, you know, I still meet some who came here as Robin and I did. Yes, I would tell him!"" I turned away, sick at heart."	['Severe sorrow']
From the passage, we can tell that the taxi driver is _ .	"One day I got in a taxi, and we left for the airport. We were driving in the right lane when, suddenly, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. My taxi driver stopped his car at once. The tire made a very loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just one inch from the black of the other car. I was _ . But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head and started yelling at us. I couldn't believe it! But my taxi driver just smiled at the guy. So I asked, ""Why did you just do that? This guy almost sent us to hospital. "" This is when my taxi driver taught me what I now call ""The Law of the Rubbish Truck . "" He explained that many people are like rubbish trucks. They run around full of rubbish, full of anger and full of bad feelings. As their rubbish piles up, they look for a place to throw it away and sometimes they'll throw it at you. Don't take it personally. Just smile, wish them well, and move on. Don't take their rubbish and spread it to other people at work, at home or on the streets. Successful people never let rubbish trucks change their moods . Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets, so love those who love you and pray for those who don't."	['wise and friendly']
What is the best title of the passage?	"Suppose you become a leader in an organization. It's very likely that you'll want to have volunteers to help with the organization's activities. To do so, it should help to understand why people undertake volunteer work and what keeps their interest in the work. Let's begin with the question of why people volunteer. Researchers have identified several factors that motivate people to get involved. For example, people volunteer to express personal values related to unselfishness, to expand their range of experiences, and to strengthen social relationships. If volunteer positions do not meet these needs, people may not wish to participate. To select volunteers, you may need to understand the motivations of the people you wish to attract. People also volunteer because they are required to do so. To increase levels of community service, some schools have launched compulsory volunteer programs. Unfortunately, these programs can shift people's wish of participation from an internal factor (e.g., ""I volunteer because it's important to me"") to an external factor (e.g., ""I volunteer because I'm required to do so""). When that happens, people become less likely to volunteer in the future. People must be sensitive to this possibility when they make volunteer activities a must. Once people begin to volunteer, what leads them to remain in their positions over time? To answer this question, researchers have conducted follow-up studies in which they track volunteers over time. For instance, one study followed 238 volunteers in Florida over a year. One of the most important factors that influenced their satisfaction as volunteers was the amount of suffering they experienced in their volunteer positions. Although this result may not surprise you, it leads to important practical advice. The researchers note that attention should be given to ""training methods that would prepare volunteers for troublesome situations or provide them with strategies for coping with the problem they do experience"". Another study of 302 volunteers at hospitals in Chicago focused on individual differences in the degree to which people view ""volunteer"" as an important social role. It was assumed that those people for whom the role of volunteer was most part of their personal identity would also be most likely to continue volunteer work. Participants indicated the degree to which the social role mattered by responding to statements such as ""Volunteering in Hospital is an important part of who I am."" Consistent with the researchers' expectations, they found a positive correlation between the strength of role identity and the length of time people continued to volunteer. These results, once again, lead to concrete advice: ""Once an individual begins volunteering, continued efforts might focus on developing a volunteer role identity.... Items like T-shirts that allow volunteers to be recognized publicly for their contributions can help strengthen role identity""."	['How to Get People to Volunteer']
"By saying ""Make that your legacy"", the author means "" _ ""."	I was driving down the road the other day, listening to sweet music coming out of my car radio. My heart felt peaceful, my mind was clear, and my soul was full of love. Even with all its problem: life seemed good. Then the music stopped and the news came on. There was talk of another famous millionaire in drug rehab after an incident with the police. There was news on the murder of a poor man whose life was supposed to be changed after winning the lottery. There was even a discussion on how much greed and excess had damaged our world. Every story seemed to point once again to the old saying that money can't buy happiness. Hearing them made me think of a movie I saw many years ago on Mother Teresa's home for the dying in India. What struck me most when I watched it wasn't the unbearable poverty there. It wasn't the sickness and suffering that the people there were going through. It was rather the peaceful smiles of love, kindness, and happiness that they shared with the Sisters and with each other.. These people had nothing. Many were struggling at the end of death. Yet, they knew the simple truth that so many of us here are still learning: Joy is Free. We can have joy and spread joy everyday of our life here. Don't love or admire dollar signs and think that money will bring you happiness then. Joy can't be purchased. It can't be owned. It can only be chosen and then given freely to others. In the eyes of eternity money is only worthless paper. The only thing that matters is the love within you and the love that you give to the world. Make that your legacy and your life will forever be rich in joy.	['Have joy and spread joy to people around you']
Caleb Deng's story serves as an example to show _ .	"Most middle school students find it boring to learn English. But students in Yat Sen middle school in New York, US, don't think so. Why? Because they are in the school of One Program, which asks students to work on their own or in small groups on computers to have math lessons. ""The program gives the students a new learning style. No traditional classroom can compare with it. We give each lesson according to the students' interest and their strong and weak points,"" said JoelI. Klein, the school's head teacher, ""we're looking for a new way that interest students children."" Students enjoy these math lessons, especially lessons with video games. They must find out the answers to math problems to get through the game. One such game is Dimension M. As students move through mazes with their keyboards, some questions come up. Caleb Deng had to answer the question: What is 5+ (6x3)? He _ on paper quickly because there was just a minute left to play. "" I was right,"" said Deng, 14, as he ended the game with a high score . ""this really makes math lessons more exciting, since we are fighting to learn better."""	['how students learn math through video games']
Hearing her son's question, the author felt _ .	"One evening last summer, when I asked my 17-year-old son, Ray, for help with dinner, his response surprised me, ""What's a colander ?"" he asked. I could only blame myself. Nobody's hands went in the sauce except my own. But that night, as I explained with a touch of panic that a colander is the thing with holes in it, I wondered what else I hadn't prepared Ray for. As parents, while we focus on our child's confidence and character, we perhaps don't always consider that we are also raising someone's future roommate, boyfriend, husband, or father. I wanted to know that I'd raised a boy who would never ask the woman in his life, ""What's for dinner?"" So I came up with a plan: I would offer Ray a private home economics course. I was delighted to find that he didn't say no. For two hours, three days a week, Ray was all mine. One day, as his tomato sauce reduced on the stove, he washed and seasoned a chicken for roasting. Then he rolled out the piecrust and filled it with apples, all while listening to my explanation on the importance of preheating an oven. I knew that he would rather have been shooting hoops I the driveway than learning to mend socks with his mother -- he tried to beg off sewing lessons, even though I insisted that one day, someone would find the sight of him fixing his own shirt very attractive -- but it couldn't be denied that he was learning, and _ . ""I appreciate more what you do as a mom,"" he told me one day. Ray now understands the finer points of cooking, and more important, he realizes there's nothing masculine about being helpless. Not only can he make his own dinner, he can make it for his family, too. That's what I call a man."	['shocked']

The main purpose of writing the text is _ .	"TLike most big projects, learning to manage your mother well is what you should do. Here are what I believe the best steps towards a better relationship with her. They are not necessarily surprising or revolutionary, but they have worked for many people. Try them. Remember your mother's age. As children, we often do not think of our mother as having an age. Even when we become conscious of her as an individual, age does not change our view; she is still our mother. Knowing our mother's age, not just in numbers of years but in terms of her psychological and physical state, often helps us to understand her better. Listen to your mother. I have found that sometimes the things my mother told me long ago are remarkably useful. If your mother knows that you respect her point of view, even if you do not share it, it will help her feel close to you. Remember that your mother has a past. A key step in managing our relationship with our mother is to find out about her early life. Niclle's mother suffered much during the Second War World War. ""My parents are both Jewish-Turkish. They met in France and married young for love. They were in their twenties when war broke out and because they were Jews, they had to go into hiding. She does speak to me about the war, and I think it is important to know what she went through. It is a part of her life that must have affected her deeply. "" Sometimes, in learning about our mother's past, we know that it can encourage us to think about her whole life. Ask your mother about your childhood history. My grandparents died when I was young. If you are fortunate enough to have living family, think of your life as _ and ask as many questions as you can to put the picture together. Understanding your roots and your childhood can help you now more clearly who you are, as part of a family which you share with your mother. Keep a sense of humor about your mother. When we hear about someone else's misfortunes with their mothers and are amused by them, our laughter is one of recognition. I have often listened to stories of difficult mothers and I have also listened to the following piece of advice they have found most helpful is: ""Don't have a sense of humor failure about your mother. "" Remember that managing your mother is really about managing yourself. Taking any measure to managing our mother is the issue of how we manage ourselves. No matter how difficult we find her, it is important to remember that is not her behavior it self that is causing us discomfort, but the way we feel about her behavior. We should follow the way of her life. At the heart of managing your mother is being able to accept your flawed self. Only then are you able to accept your mother---with all her failings."

If you are fined thousands of dollars in Japan, you may have been _ .	There are some strange driving laws in different countries. Vietnam: If you're in Vietnam without a Vietnamese driver's license, you risk a prison sentence of up to 3years. Russia: In Moscow, if your car is dirty enough to draw dust art, you will be fined about 2,000 rubles. Worse yet, it's not legal to wash your car by hand in public places--forcing you to take it to one of the few car wash facilities. Thailand: Drivers--males or females--can't drive shirtless, whether it's a car, a bus or a tuk-tuk. France: France requires its drivers to carry a potable breathalyzer all the time when driving a car. The one-time breathalyzer cost around US $ 5, and if you don't have one, you will be fined US $ 15. Cyprus: Raising your hands in the car can get you fined of US $ 35. The law states a driver can be fined if the person is not in a regular position inside the car or raises his hands from the steering wheel unnecessarily. Japan: Politeness isn't just the culture in Japan; it's part of driving laws. Splashing a person by driving through a puddle with your car will cost you over US $ 60. The country is also strict with its DUI laws---riding with or lending your car to a driver who gets caught drinking can lead to a fine costing thousands of dollars.

To have extreme sports, you should _ .	"Nowadays more and more young athletes are taking part in the risky activities called ""extreme sports"" or ""X-sports"". In the past young athletes would play baseball. Today, they want risk and excitement -- the closer to the edge, the better. They snowboard over cliff and hike deep mountains. Extreme sports started as an alternative to more expensive sports such as golf. A city kid who couldn't afford expensive sports equipment could get a skateboard and have fun. But now it has become a whole new area of sports, with specialized equipment and high levels of skill. There is even an Olympics for extreme sports, called the winter x-game, which includes snow mountain hiking and ice climbing. What makes extreme sports so popular? Maybe it's because people love the risk. City people want to be outdoors on the weekends and do something challenging. The new equipment is so much better that people can take more risks without getting hurt. Sure there's a risk. Once you go mountain hiking or snowboarding, it's impossible to go back to have riding or skiing. It's just too boring. Now even the older crowd is starting to join in. Every weekend, groups of friends in their early 30s get together. On weekdays they work as computer programmers in the same office. On weekends they hike mountains together. Extreme sports are certainly not for everyone. Most people still prefer to play basketball or watch sports on TV. But it has been a fact that extreme sports are gaining popularity."

What wasn't included in the writer's second time plan?	In general, it's hard to spend enough time in both concentrating on lessons and taking part in social activities. But I wanted to succeed in both. I knew this would be a challenge but I didn't realize how difficult it was until my classes in the high school began. I got on well with other girls. After school, I often had ice cream with them first instead of finishing my homework before it was time to hand it in. I always finished it the next day between classes. I knew it wasn't very good and the grades that I get showed I was not hard-working enough. I realized that I needed to find some kind of balance. So I created a timetable that would divide my time between studying and relaxing. It was a good idea but I was only able to follow it for a few days because it made me under too much pressure. Later, I tried another plan. Each week I listed everything that I had to get done during the week and the time by which I had to get it done. Then under the things I had to do, I made another list of things that I could do if I had time. It worked really well. Ever since I have never missed any important things. At the same time, I enjoyed my spare time a lot. Planning my time has been challenging, but I continue to do it. I'm glad that I've learned to balance things and it has helped prepare for what is coming after graduation.	"[""The things she shouldn't do.""]"

Why does the writer compare the fish to trees?	Fish have ears. Really. They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths. As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree. Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements of each otolith ring. The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring. Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history. In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles. This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears.	['They both have growth rings.']
UNESCO encourages all the following EXCEPT _ of cultural and natural heritage around the world.	Heritage is our legacy from the past, what we live with today, and what we pass on to future generations. Our cultural and natural heritage are both irreplaceable sources of life and inspiration. Places as unique and diverse as the wilds of East Africa's Serengeti, the Pyramids of Egypt, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia and the Baroque cathedrals of Latin America make up our world's heritage. What makes the concept of World Heritage exceptional is its universal application. World Heritage sites belong to all the peoples of the world, regardless of the territory on which they are located. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) seeks to encourage the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity. This is _ in an international treaty called the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by UNESCO in 1972. UNESCO's World Heritage mission is to: encourage countries to sign the World Heritage Convention and to ensure the protection of their natural and cultural heritage; encourage States Parties to the Convention to nominate sites within their national territory for inclusion on the World Heritage List; encourage States Parties to establish management plans and set up reporting systems on the state of conservation of their World Heritage sites; help States Parties safeguard World Heritage properties by providing technical assistance and professional training; provide emergency assistance for World Heritage sites in immediate danger; support States Parties' public awareness-building activities for World Heritage conservation; encourage participation of the local population in the preservation of their cultural and natural heritage; encourage international cooperation in the conservation of our world's cultural and natural heritage.

What is Emily Blackwell's opinion on dogs' behavior?	lt's a dog's life for the nation's mutts - who are becoming anxious and aggressive through lack of play, experts fear. A study of 4,000 dog owners has found a clear link between limited playtime and behaviour problems, such as being nervous when left alone, disobedience and snapping at other animals. And while researchers can't be sure that playing less is directly to blame, they say that games provide vital intellectual stimulation and exercise. The Bristol University study showed that only one in five owners play with their dogs six times a day. Half play two or three times a day and 10 per cent have just one play session. Mark Evans, former chief vet for the RSPCA, said that dogs are one of the few animals to play into adulthood. He told the Sunday Times: 'There is a clear association in the results. Owners report more potential behaviour problems in dogs that play less.' Emily Blackwell -- who conducted the research uncovered tonight on Channel 4's Dogs: Their Secret Lives - said dogs often enjoy playing so much that they slow down or change strategy to make the fun last longer. The lecturer in canine welfare hopes that 10,000 people will eventually fill out the survey. This will enable her to firmly establish whether lack of play is affecting dogs' moods - or if their emotional problems put their owners off spending time with them. For instance,they may slow down when playing 'chase', allowing their owner to catch up with them and the game to continue. Favourite games include wrestling, chase and tugging at toys, and perhaps unsurprisingly,'fetch' topped the list. Tennis balls were the favourite toys, followed by soft, squeaky toys, rubber balls and rope toys. The research comes just days after an animal charity warned that millions of dogs are becoming fat. aggressive and destructive because their owners are clueless about basic animal care.The PDSA said that treats including beer, chips and leftover takeaways are making dogs fat and unwell - and wamed that almost a million are never taken for a walk.

According to the recent study, when birds migrate _ .	"Scientists have been puzzled by the phenomenon that migrating birds fly not just in groups all the time, but in ""V"" formations and they have tried to figure out what benefit birds get from this particular formation. Now, a research group from University of London may have found the answer -- migrating birds fly in a ""V"" to save energy, according to a study published in the journal Nature. When a bird flaps its wings, it stirs the air around it and causes it to move indifferent directions. Scientist found in the study that the air creates an upward-moving wave at the tips of the wings, which means that if a bird flies around the wingtips of another bird, it can get a boost from the rising air and therefore use less energy to stay in the air. Apart form the ""free ride"" strategy, scientists were also surprised to observe that migrating birds timed their wing beats and adjusted their positions in a very precise way to maximize the lifting effect while avoiding areas where the air move downward. ""They're able to sense what's going on from the bird in front, where this 'good air' is coming from and now how to position themselves perfectly in it,"" lead researcher Steven Portugal told BBC. In fact, the ""V"" formation has long thought to help birds fly more efficiently . A previous study showed that birds' heart rates went down when they were flying together in a ""V"" formation. Jet fighters were also found to be able reduce their energy use by up to 18% by staying near the wingtips of other jet fighters. Both of these findings led scientists to suspect that the ""V"" formation had an efficiency purpose, but until now they still lack proof. ""For scientists, the new study provides an insight into an interesting natural phenomenon. But it could mean even more for aircraft companies -- helping them understand how they can _ that with their plane formations to save fuel, said Portugal."""

Sign language _ .	Why should you learn Sign Language? Do you want to improve your communication with a family member or friend who is deaf? Do you want to be able to communicate with deaf people in general? Would you like to advance in your career by being able to communicate in ASL? Do you want to be a Sign Language interpreter? Sign language is not just a random collection of gestures but a full-blown language in its own right, complete with its own grammatical rules. Each country or region has its own sign language, as different from each other as English is from Spanish. Each version of sign language is somewhat linked to the spoken language in its region. For example, American sign language does share similarities with English, even though it is its own language. The advantages of knowing sign language in addition to a spoken language are many. Communication becomes possible on many levels with the deaf community, with other people either hearing or not in any of the above situations, as well as many more. While other languages take years to learn, American Sign Language can be taught in a much shorter time period. It is one of the easiest languages to learn because most of the signs were developed to mimic the actual word or phrase it is representing. Even the alphabet signs look like the letters of the English alphabet. American Sign Language, or ASL, is the third most used language in the United States. Used by the deaf community, interpreters, and friends and family of the deaf. There are a lot of sites on the internet that not only shows you the sign with video, but will help you practice reading signs as well. Teaching even hearing babies sign language seems to be the fashion in recent years and for good reason. Communicating in sign language is fun and natural as babies naturally use body gestures in early communication. Teaching baby sign language actually appears to enhance the learning of verbal skills and brain development of the children involved.	['is a collection of gestures']
In what way is Ricci quite different from other artists?	"If you're in Florence, Italy, and see a man on a ladder wiping the dust off statues and buildings, don't worry.It's just Alessandro Ricci gathering material for his famous smog paintings. Ricci is not a common artist, because he used smog as the main medium of his artworks. Unlike other painters seeking fast recognition of their talent, he doesn't really care about ""being this big artist"".Instead he is more concerned about bringing attention to how much smog there really is in his home town and how it's destroying both its monuments and people. Although he did take a couple of art classes a few years back, he is mainly self-taught, doesn't work in a studio, donates most of his work, and refuses to play by the rules of the Florentine Art Gallery, which he considers corrupt.Alessandro Ricci believes selling his smog paintings will not only compromise his principles, but also contradict the very thing he's trying to do-raise awareness about smog pollution in this city. Alessandro lives with his parents nearby Florence, but almost every day he visits the streets of the city, and collects smog for his paintings.He gets it from several meters above ground, from clean surfaces like marble, plastic and stone, using damp pieces of cotton.Then he applies the smog directly onto a cloth and creates street scenes and reproductions of the very buildings from which he got the dangerous material.Finally, he seals his paintings with a natural resin . His actions helped win a small victory for the people of Florence, as in October 25, 2012 the Duomo area of the city was made pedestrian-only.But there is still a long way to go, the artist believes, and only cleaning the thick layer of smog that has accumulated throughout Florence would take several years.Still, he continues to paint his unique smog artworks and let the people know how polluted the environment they live in really is."

The writer himself felt surprised at _ .	"""Long time no see"" is a very interesting sentence. When I first read this sentence from an American friend's email, I laughed. I thought it was a perfect example of Chinglish. Obviously, it is a word-by-word literal translation of the Chinese greetings with a ruled English grammar and structure! Later on, my friend told me that it is a standard American greeting. I was too thrilled to believe her. Her words could not convince me at all. So I did a research on google.com. To my surprise, there are over 60 thousand web pages containing ""Long time no see."" This sentence has been widely used in emails, letters, newspapers, movies, books, or any other possible places. Though it is sort of informal, it is part of the language that Americans use daily. Ironically, if you type this phrase in Microsoft Word, the software will tell you that the grammar needs to be corrected. Nobody knows the origin of this Chinglish sentence. Some people believe that it came from Charlie Chan's movies. In the 1930s, Hollywood moviemakers successfully created a world wide famous Chinese detective named ""Charlie Chan"" on wide screens. Detective Chan likes to teach Americans some Chinese wisdom by quoting Confucius. ""Long time no see"" was his trademark. Soon after Charlie Chan, ""Long time no see"" became a popular phrase in the real world with thanks to the popularity of these movies. Some scholars refer to America as a huge pot of stew. All kinds of culture are mixed in the stew together, and they change the color and taste of each other. American Chinese, though a minority ethnic group in the United States, is also contributing some changes to the stew! Language is usually the first thing to be influenced in the mixed stew. You can have some other examples than adoptions from Chinese, such as pizza from Italian, susi from Japanese, and deja vu from French etc. There is a long list! Americans do not just simply borrow something from others. They will modify it and make it their own, so you would not be surprised to find a tofu and peanut butter hamburger in a restaurant, or to buy a bottle of iced Chinese green tea with honey in a grocery store. Since Americans appreciate Chinese culture more and more nowadays, I believe more Chinese words will become American English in the future. In this way the American stew keeps adding richness and flavor."	"['""Long time no see"" used as standard American English']"
Which is the right colour for different rooms?	In general, people talk about two groups of colours warm colours and cool colours. Researchers in psychology think that there are also two groups of people people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red. The cool colours are green, blue and violet. These colours, unlike warm colours , are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggests that a warm colour, such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly. Researchers do not know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that red, orange, and yellow are warm and that green, blue and violet are cool. Perhaps warm colours remind people of warm days and the cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow.

How does the author feel about his repetitive work by the water ?	There seems to be a general assumption that brilliant people cannot stand routine ; that they need a varied , exciting life in order to do their best . It is also assumed that dull people are particularly suited for dull work . We are told that the reason the present-day young complain so loudly about the dullness of jobs is that they are better educated and brighter than the young of the past . Actually , there is no evidence that people who achieve a lot desire , let alone live , colorful lives . The opposite is nearer the truth . Einstein worked out his theory of relativity while serving as a clerk in a Swiss patent office . Immanuel Kant's daily life was a dull routine . The housewives of Konigsberg set their clocks when they saw him pass , on his way to the university . He took the same walk each morning , rain or shine . The greatest distance Kant ever traveled was sixty miles from Konigsberg . It may be true that work on the assembly line dulls the abilities and empties the mind , and the cure is only fewer hours of work at higher pay . But during fifty years as a workingman , I have found dull routine coexisting with an active mind . While doing dull , repetitive work by the water , I could talk with my partners and compose sentences in my mind , all at the same time . Chances are that had my work been too interesting I could not have done any thinking and composing at work or even on my own time after returning from work . People who find dull jobs unbearable are often dull people who do not know what to do with themselves at leisure . Children and mature people will get used to dull routine , while the adolescent , who has lost the child's ability for concentration and is without the inner resources of the mature , needs excitement and novelty to get rid of boredom .

This 1,200-mile race is unusual because _ .	"Each year on the first Saturday in March, a group of middle-aged men and a few women gather at sunrise on a beach near prefix = st1 /St. Petersburg,Fla.Above the high-water line are more than 50 small boats. At exactly 7 a.m., Steve Isaac stands at the water's edge with his arm raised and yells: ""Go!"" Most of the boats are part of the Everglades Challenge. They head for a finish line many days and 300 miles to the south, at Key Largo. But this Saturday, for the first time, 10 of the brave mariners--including a journalist, whose progress will be available online--will compete in the world's toughest small boat race, called the Ultimate Florida Challenge. Instead of finishing at Key Largo, the 10 boaters will continue around the state, heading north past Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, and Jacksonville, then down the Suwannee River, eventually passing most of Florida before arriving back at the beach near St. Petersburg. It will be 1,200 miles of head winds and burning sun. But it will also take the challengers through some of the most impressive scenery in North America. The rules are no-nonsense: First one back to the beach wins. The voyage must be completed within a month. Human power or sails, only. No motors. No rides in cars or tows from power boats. No help from family or friends. And at least once a day, participants are required to acknowledge by cell phone or radio that they are still alive. The race will be a replay of the tale of the tortoise and the rabbit. The trick, if there is one, is to be a tortoise and just keep moving forward. But the one-month deadline means that being too much of a tortoise may result in failure. So challengers have to be a little bit of a rabbit, as well."	['it will be more challenging']

If you want to visit the museum, when can you go?	The Winter Palace was built between 1754 and 1762 for Empress Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great. Unfortunately, Elizabeth died before the palace was completed and only Catherine the Great and her successors were able to enjoy the great interior of Elizabeth's home. Many parts of the palace's impressive interior have been remodeled since then, particularly after 1837, when a huge fire destroyed most of the building. Today the Winter Palace, together with four more buildings arranged side by side along the river embankment, houses the extensive collections of the Hermitage. The Hermitage Museum is the largest art gallery in Russia and is among the largest and most respected art museums in the world. The museum was founded in 1764 when Catherine the Great bought a collection of 255 paintings from the German city of Berlin. Today, the Hermitage boasts over 2.7 million exhibits and displays, a diverse range of art and artifacts from all over the world and throughout history (from Ancient Egypt to the early 20th century Europe). The Hermitage's collections include works by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian, a collection of Rembrandts and Rubens, many French Impressionist works by Renoir, Cezanne, Monet and Pissarro, and several works by Rodin. The collection is really worth a stop for all those interested in art and history. The experts say that if you were to spend a minute looking at each exhibit on show in the Hermitage, you would need 11 years before you'd seen them all.

How did the dog react to the command to track?	"""Track!"" said my master. Like any good tracker-dog who has received the command he most loves, I gave a bark of excitement, put my nose down to the ground and sniffed. The ground was rich with smells. Even in the high-class housing area where we were working, the stones held traces of many sole and confusing scents (smells). As I searched for the scent that would give me a clue to the tail of the guilty man, my tail wagged slowly, thoughtfully, delightedly. Work was like play to me; I enjoyed it. A small group of people gathered behind us. Among these onlookers was the old caretaker of the building next door to ours. He spoke in a scornful voice, ""You actually think your dog might catch a thief three days after the event?"" My master said nothing, but I'm sure he must have smiled. I did not turn to look. I knew he would not speak unless it was to give me a new command. I needed to concentrate. My task was difficult. I had to pick out one scent among the many that lay about and then tracked it to its source. ""You're wasting your time,"" said the caretaker. I looked at him without raising my head. He was running his hand over his fat stomach. His rough palm and smooth shirt combined to make a slight noise. It was part of my training to be aware--often it is only a little whisper of a noise that alerts you to be drawing of a weapon. But of course the aging caretaker was going to do no such thing. There was no smell of fear or nervousness about him. He was merely being clever and talkative. ""I've seen many tracker-dogs in my time,"" said the caretaker to the onlookers. I served with the police years ago. We would never have thought of using a tracker-dog to find a car thief. Impossible. Everyone knows that dogs are useless in such matters. In a sense he was right. I'm sure there's no need to tell you that, just as a dog's hearing is much better than a human being's, so his sense of smell tells one thing from another far better than a great detective. If Sherlock Holmes could work out that a man had had an egg for breakfast by seeing the yellow stain on his mouth, a trained dog could tell you whether the hen that laid the egg was healthy or not. I know it sounds funny and I mean it to be. But I'm not exaggerating. A dog can tell you--if you understand a dog's way of communicating--all this and more without even setting eyes on the man he is investigating."

Hard training before a marathon can _ .	Running a marathon Have you ever taken part in a marathon? A marathon is 42km long. It is the longest race in the world. To make the runner's body work, harder training is quite necessary. A runner should start to prepare for a marathon at least three months before. Preparation may have races, many hours of running at different speeds and changes in diet . During the training time the runner must eat a fit diet. The diet should have lots of things needed in training the players. In the early days of training, runners run 80km per week. The running is increased every two or three weeks and at least two long runs per week are needed. Two weeks before the marathon, the training programme becomes less, from 100km per week down to 60km and then to 30km in the final week. On the last two days they may not run at all. Breakfast should be eaten at least three hours before the race. Easily digested food such as cereal , toast and scrambled egg is best, with as much fluid as possible. Runners should drink water about half an hour before the race to keep up the body fluid.	['help the players to make more progress']
What is conveyed in this passage?	"Golden sunlight danced in the treetops, and children's laughter filled the park. The smell of popcorn played on the breeze, and life seemed good. It was one of the happiest Saturday mornings I had spent with my little daughter, Gigi. That is, until two strangers threw her into their car and sped away. It seemed like a bad dream. I could barely whisper when the police questioned me. For hours we waited,but there was no word on the whereabouts of the car. Tears would start to come. Then nothing. I was numb with fear. ""Go home, Ma'am,"" the police officer said. ""I'll have someone drive you. We'll also want to monitor your telephone. The kidnappers might call, and we'll want to keep track. Trust me, these guys can't get far. "" After what had just happened, it was hard for me to trust anything. My friend Gloria came over that afternoon. ""I heard about Gigi on the radio,"" she said. ""Everyone is looking for the car. The interstates are all blocked."" She took my hand. ""Look here,"" Gloria said. "" I want you to have this picture, and I want you to pray with me."" It was a picture of a little girl sound asleep in her bed. Standing by the bed was a tall, blond angel. His hand was touching the girl's shoulder as he smiled down at her. My nerves were frazzled. ""You know I don't believe in that kind of thing!"" I snapped. ""I'm too exhausted for any hocus-pocus right now, Gloria!I want my daughter home!"" I started to shake, and then I began sobbing. Gloria placed the photo on our mantle and knelt down beside me. ""Just pray with me,"" she said, holding my hand. I had no strength left, so we prayed and waited what seemed an eternity. Together, we waited by the phone until sunset. The phone never rang. Suddenly, the front door swung open. I looked up and screamed. There stood Gigi. ""Gigi! Thank God!"" I cried, throwing my arms around her, ""Where did those men take you? How did you get home? Did the police find you?"" ""No Mommy!"" said Gigi. ""I was really scared because those men said they were taking me far away. We were going really fast on an old rock road never seen before. But then a tall man walked out in front of the car, and they ran off the road and hit a tree."" Then the tall man ran up and opened the car door and pulled me out. He was really nice, and said I would be okay now, and that those men couldn't hurt me. I must have gone to sleep, because then I woke up here in front of our house. He must have brought me home,"" ""But who... how did he know... where to bring you?"" My voice broke and trailed to a whisper. ""I don't know, Mommy,"" Gigi said. ""But he was really friendly, and I wasn't scared of him at all."" Just then Gigi noticed Gloria's picture on the mantle. ""That's him!"" She gave a loud cry, pointing at the picture. ""Mommy, the tail blond man dressed like an angel. That's the man that pulled me out of the car!"" I felt chill-bumps across my neck and arms. Gloria turned pale. ""Are you sure that's the man?"" Gloria asked. ""Yeah, that's him. Except he didn't have wings, and he was wearing blue jeans and a tee shirt. But that's him exactly. I'd remember him anywhere!"" Later that night, the police found the injured kidnappers in their damaged car fifty miles from our home. When questioned-the driver remembered making a sharp turn to avoid hitting a tall blond man and the backseat door that Gigi sat by had been completely torn off its hinges. Twenty years have gone by. We have never heard from anyone claiming to have rescued Gigi and there have been no logical explanations for Gigi's miraculous escape and return home from a wreck so far away. There have always been things that people can't explain. But, from that day forward, I believe that all experiences, positive and negative, are given to us for our strengthening and learning. Gigi now takes her little girl to the park on Saturdays. They enjoy the sunlight as it dances in the treetops, the smell of popcorn, and the laughter of children. She keeps Gloria's picture on her mantle, and she remembers her angelic friend. And, like my daughter, I have a faith that has carried me through many trials since that day many years ago."

How would you treat temporary loneliness according to the passage?	"Most people feel lonely sometimes, but it usually lasts only a few minutes or a few hours.This kind of loneliness is not serious.In fact, it is quite normal.For some people, though, loneliness can last for years.Now researchers say there are three different kinds of loneliness. The first kind of loneliness is temporary.This is the most common type.It usually disappears quickly and does not need any special attention. The second kind, situational loneliness, is a natural result of a certain situation, for example, a family problem, the death of a loved one, or moving to a new place.Although this kind of loneliness can cause physical problems, such as headaches and sleeplessness, _ usually does not last for more than a year. The third kind of loneliness is the most severe.Unlike the second type, chronic loneliness usually lasts more than two years and has no specific cause.People who experience habitual loneliness have problems socializing and being close to others.Unfortunately, many chronically lonely people think there is little or nothing they can do to improve their condition. Psychologists agree that one important factor in loneliness is a person's social contacts, such as friends, family members, co-workers, etc.We depend on various people for different reasons.For instance, our families give us emotional support, our parents and teachers give us guidance, and our friends share interests and activities.However, psychologists have found that, though lonely people have many social contacts, they sometimes feel they should have more.They question then"" own popularity. Psychologists are trying to find ways to help habitually lonely people for two reasons: they are unhappy and unable to socialize and there is a connection between chronic loneliness and serious illness such as heart disease.While temporary and situational loneliness can be a normal and healthy part of life, chronic loneliness can be a very sad and sometimes dangerous condition."	['Just ignore it.']
What is the main idea of this passage?	"I had an experience once which taught me something about the ways people made a bad situation worse by blaming themselves. One January, I officiated at two funerals for two elderly women. Both died a natural death. At the first home, the son of the deceased woman said, ""If only I had sent my mother to Florida and gotten her out of this cold and snow, she would be alive today. It's my fault that she died."" At the second home, the son said, ""If only I had not insisted her going to Florida, she would be alive today. That long airplane ride was more than she could take. It is my fault."" When things don't turn out as we would like them to, we tend to assume that had we done things differently, the story would have had a happier ending. Any time there is a death, the survivors will feel guilty. Because the course of action they took turned out bad, they believe that the opposite course, for example, keeping mother at home, would have turned out better. After all, how could it have turned out any worse? There seem to be elements involved in our readiness to feel guilty. The first lies in our belief that the world makes sense----there is a reason for everything that happens. The second is the thought that we are the cause of what happens, especially the bad things that happen. The roots of this feeling may lie in our childhood. A baby comes to think that the world exists to meet his needs, and that he makes everything happen in it. He wakes up in the morning and calls the rest of the world to its tasks. He cries, and someone comes to attend to him. When he is hungry, people feed him, and when he is wet, people change him. Very often, we do not completely abandon that childish thought that our wishes cause things to happen."	['Two factors account for guilty sense.']
What did the cat look like when it came to the writer's home?	Something was crying outside. So I went out to see what was happening. A big cat sat by the door. It must run for a long time as it looked tired and dirty. I let it in my house and took out some food; this poor cat ate all, but still looked starving..., so I got my own cats' fish, and the cat ate that too! My five-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter were interested in the cat. They bathed (......) it and fed it more food. They wanted to keep it. But I didn't agree. It was not because I didn't love it. We already had 2 cats and 2 dogs and our house was not big enough to keep more. Another reason was that I thought maybe it got lost. And its owner must be worried about it. Then I posted notices all over the town in the hope of finding its home. I also bought an ad time on a radio station. Three weeks passed, but there was no response . Finally, I decided to keep the cat. Our house was small, but I would take good care of it as possible as I could.	['Tired and dirty.']
Cuckoos arrived in the UK much earlier than normal probably because of _ .	"Their beautiful call suggests the arrival of spring,but the routes taken by cuckoos during their annual migration have remained a mystery.Now,though,scientists from the British Trust for Omithology(BTO)have revealed the details of their remarkable 10,000-mile journey,with the help of tracking devices. Five male birds were caught in Norfolk last May and fitted with satellite-tagged ""backpacks'' before being released.The scientists then monitored their progress over 12 months as they flew to Africa in the autumn,and returned in the spring. The project was carried out to discover why every year fewer of the birds return to Britain.Between 1995 and 2010,the population of cuckoos spending sumnler here fell by almost half,and the number is continuing to decline.Previously,the lack of information about the cuckoos'long migration has hamoered the understanding of how to help conserve the birds. Earlier this year,it was reported that cuckoos arrived in the UK much earlier than normal.Their call was recorded by ornithologists as early as February,a month ahead of their usual arrival. Like all migrating animals,cuckoos respond to the changing seasons.They depend on lush plants to provide the fruit and food for insects that they feed on.This reliance on seasonal patternsmeans that a changing climate could make an already challenging journey impossible for them."

How is the passage developed?	"Best friends may be priceless but the cost of keeping the relationship alive is PS23,870. According to a study, a BFF (best friends forever) does not come cheap with devoted friends spending PS4,679 on birthday presents alone over a lifetime. And while it costs nothing to be a shoulder to cry on, _ Britons go the extra mile and spend PS168 on pick-me-ups to get their mate through a rocky patch like the breakup of a relationship. There's a further PS242 spent on presents to show how much they mean from gifts bought on holiday to treats for no reason. And distance does not break up a close friendship as BFFs spend a whopping PS18,000 on travel to see each other despite being miles apart because of university, jobs and marriage. The study by cashback site TopCashBack found on average BEFs who marry can expect PS431 spent on them and a further PS283 on gifts when they have children. And they can rely on their pals to help out when they move houses as they will obtain PS127 worth of housewarming presents and takeaways(a kind of food). The survey based on a friendship lasting 40 years found more than eight in ten adults with a BFF felt their friendships were worth every penny. TopCashback spokesperson Natasha Smith said: ""Those friendships which stand the test of time are often the most important in our lives. However, they come at a cost. From train tickets once a month to flights and a new dress for a wedding on the Italian coast, the price paid for having a best mate can soon add up. But when we asked people to compare their friendship with the financial investment , only 14% thought their friendship was equal to their investment with the vast majority thinking it was worth more."""

Julia Butterfly Hill traveled to California _ .	"At the age of 16, Julia Butterfly Hill quit school and worked at a restaurant. For many years, she was only interested in making money and material things. Then one day she had a serious car accident, which changed her life. Hill said: ""I realized I wanted to find a more powerful purpose for being here on this planet."" As soon as she recovered, Hill traveled to California. There she saw ancient redwood trees, which are the largest trees in the whole world. The wood from redwood trunks is very hard. So the Pacific Lumber Company cut down many of the huge redwoods to use for construction. There are not many forests of these trees left. Many environmental activists want to protect the remaining trees. The redwoods are very important to the environment. In 1997 Hill learned a group called Earth First was working to protect a particular group of trees. They decided to send someone up into a redwood tree, hoping this would stop the company from cutting the trees down. Julia Butterfly Hill volunteered. Hill lived in the tree for over two years without ever coming down. Her home was a 6-by-8-foot tree house, 180 feet up. It is always cold and wet in a redwood tree. There were even very serious winter storms while Hill was in the tree. The wind and cold almost knocked Hill out of the tree. But she did not fall -- she survived. Finally, after years of arguing, the company decided to protect Luna, the tree Hill lived in. They signed an agreement to never cut down this huge redwood tree or the trees around it. When Hill put her feet on the earth again, she began to cry. But from that moment on Hill hasn't stopped working to protect the environment."	['in expectation of doing something meaningful']
Which of the following can be the best title of the passage?	"A Swedish man was dug out alive after being snowed in his car on a forest track for two months with no food, police and local media reported on Saturday. The 45-year-old from southern Sweden was found on Friday, February17, too weak to say more than a few words. He was found not far from the city of Umea in the north of Sweden by snowmobilers who thought they had come across a ruined car until they dug their way to a window and saw movement inside. The man, who was lying in the back seat in a sleeping bag, said he had been in the car since December 19. ""Just incredible that he's alive considering that he had no food, but also since it's been really cold for some time after Christmas."" a rescue team member told regional daily Vasterbottens- Kuriren, which broke the news. Ebbe Nyberg, duty officer at the Umea police, said police saw no reason to doubt that the man had been stuck in the car for a very long time. ""We would not make up something like this. The rescue services were on site too and saw the same as us."" he told Vasterbottens-Kuriren. Umea University Hospital, where the man is recovering after being rescued by police and a rescue team, said in a statement he was doing well considering the circumstances. Doctors at the hospital said humans would normally be able to survive for about four weeks without food. Besides eating snow, the man probably survived by going into a dormant-like state, physician Stefan Branth told Vasterbottens-Kuriren. ""A bit like a bear that hibernates. Humans can do that."" he said. ""He probably had a body temperature of around 31 degrees which the body adjusted to. Due to the low temperature, not much energy was used up."" ""Why the man ended up under the snow in the forest remains unknown,"" police said."	['An Incredible Survival']

The writer presents the second example in order to _ .	"In a cab, a woman seemed in such a hurry. She constantly rushed the cab driver to drive quickly. She was so absorbed in her own thoughts of getting to the airport as soon as possible that she was not aware they were going by a different route. All of a sudden, a young man got inside the cab. He took her handbag in which she had put her visa, passport, and all the money for the trip. The cab driver, who was _ the robber, left her in the exactly middle of a dark street. She thought that she was rather unfortunate in the very situation. During the very night, she was told a piece of shocking news. Tears came down her cheek. Flight 360, the plane that she should have got on board, had crashed. Had she not lost her important belongings, she could surely have lost the thing far more precious----her life. Sometimes bad things really happen. There are times when nothing seems to go our way. So what should we do about it? We must get rid of all these frustrations and start all over again in the faith that we will get what we deserve. Don't waste your time and energy on things that can't be changed. Continuous worrying will only affect your health and you'll be doing much more damage than what was previously done. What if it was the other way round? What if we never ran out of good luck? There was a man who won the lottery. He became greedy and wasted all his money on everything he could get his hands on. But when he one day made it to the front page of the newspaper again, it was a different story. He had been killed because of his riches. If you attain good luck, you can never be too secure about it. Life is so unpredictable. You never know what will happen next. Live one day at a time. We sometimes subject ourselves to unnecessary emotional trouble. But please don't forget: sometimes misfortune can be the source of happiness. Live for the moment. Do what must be done for the present and the future will turn out just fine. Believe me. And believe in yourself. As Captain Planet always says, ""The power is yours!"""

In the four children's ideal schools, we can know _ .	We spend hours, days and years of our lives in studying. But what do you think of your school? What is your ideal school like? Here is some designing from four children in different countries. I'm Ma from China. My dream school has a swimming pool and two football fields. It also has a cinema, a restaurant and a shopping centre. Now my school has none of these and I think there should be more enjoyable things for pupils to do while they are studying. I am Sonia from Italy. I'd like a room. We can go and play computer games and chat with friends there. Some older pupils in the school have this but I think there should be a place for everyone to go when they want to switch from the lessons. I am Richard from the USA. I think it would be great to have a three days' holiday every week. We could have a long holiday. What fun! I also think school should start at ten o'clock, and finish at three o'clock in the afternoon. I am Rebecca from Australia. My dream school would be big and roomy with a computer for every person in the school. I'd also like to have a music room. We can go and play instruments when we want.

The author mainly intends to tell us to _ .	"Sometimes people call each other "" scared cat"" , but have you ever thought about this expression? When a cat is frightened, its heart starts beating faster, its muscles get tense, and there are changes in the chemicals in its blood-stream. If the danger continues, this animal will do one of the two things. It will defend itself, or it will run away as fast as it can. Something like this also happens to people. When we are excited, angry, scared, or aroused by other emotions, our bodies go through many physical changes. Our hearts beat faster, and our muscles get tense. All of these changes make us more alert and ready to react. We, too, get ready to defend ourselves or run. Human beings, however, have a problem. If we give way to our feelings and let them take over, we can get into trouble. Have you ever said something in anger - and regretted later? Have you ever shouted at a teacher or told somebody you were lonely and then wished later you had kept your mouth shut? It isn't always wise to express your feelings freely. Does this mean that it's always smarter to hide our feelings? No! If you keep feelings like anger hidden away or bottled up inside, your body stays tense. Physical illnesses can develop, and you can feel disturbed badly inside. _ can actually be bad for your health. Feelings that you keep all bottled up inside don't just go away. It's as if you bought some bananas and stuck them in a cupboard. You might not be able to see them, but before long you'd smell them. And if you opened the cupboard, chances are you'd see little fruit flies hovering all over them. They'd be rotten. You can try to treat emotions as if they were bananas in the cupboard. You can hide them and you can pretend they don't exit, but they'll still be around. And at last you'll have to deal with them, just like those bananas."

Which of the following is the best title for the passage?	"When you get in your car, you reach for it. When you're at work, you take a break to have a moment alone with it. When you get into a lift, you play with it. Cigarette? Cup of coffee? No, it's the third most addictive thing in modem life, the cell phone. And experts say it is becoming more difficult for many people to _ their longing to hug it more tightly than most of their personal relationships. The costs are becoming more and more evident, and I don't mean just the monthly bill. Dr. Chris Knippers, a counselor at the Betty ford Center in Southern California, reports that the overuse of cell phones has become a social problem not much different from other harmful addictions: a barrier to one-on-one personal contact, and an escape from reality. Sounds extreme, but we' ve all witnessed the evidence: The person at a restaurant who talks on the phone through an entire meal, ignoring his kids around the table; the woman who talks on the phone in the car, ignoring her husband; the teen who texts messages all the way home from school, avoiding contact with kids all around him. Jim Williams, an industrial sociologist based in Massachusetts, notes that cell - phone addiction is part of a set of symptoms in a widening gulf of personal separation. He points to a study by Duke University researchers that found one-quarter of Americans say they have no one to discuss their most important personal business with. Despite the growing use of phones, e - mail and instant messaging, in other words, Williams says studies show that we don't have as many friends as our parents. "" Just as more information has led to less wisdom, more acquaintances via the Internet and cell phones have produced fewer friends,"" he says. If the cell phone has truly had these effects, it's because it has become very widespread. Consider that in 1987, there were only l million cell phones in use. Today, something like 300 million Americans carry them. They far outnumber wired phones in the United States."	['Cell phones Are the New Cigarettes']
Why did Sarah write home?	Sarah Williams went to a boarding school. Here is one of the letters she wrote to her parents from the school. Wentworth Girls' School Beachside July 20th Dearest Mom and Dad, I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you. I have been very naughty and the school principal is very angry with me. She is going to write to you. You must come and take me away from here. She does not want me in the school any longer. The trouble started last night when I was smoking in bed. This is against the rules, of course. We are not supposed to smoke at all. As I was smoking, I heard footsteps coming towards the room. I did not want a teacher to catch me smoking, so I threw the cigarette away. Unfortunately, the cigarette fell into the waste-paper basket, which caught fire. There was a curtain near the waste-paper basket which caught fire, too. Soon the whole room was burning. The principal phoned for the fire department. The school is a long way from the town and by the time the fire department arrived, the whole school was in flames. Many of the girls are in the hospital. The principal says that the fire was all my fault and you must pay for the damage. She will send you a bill for about a million dollars. I'm very sorry about this. Much love, Sarah P. S. None of the above is true, but I have failed my exams. I just want you to know how bad things could have been!	['To tell her parents she had failed her exams.']

When was China's aircraft carrier born?	"Six days before the 63rd birthday of New China, our country received a great gift. The country's first aircraft carrier , Liaoning, has made China become the l0th country in the world to have an aircraft camer. An aircraft carrier is a kind of ship that planes can fly from and land on--like an airport on the sea. It stands for a country's military strength . It plays an important role in modern wars. In August last year, the air craft carrier began its trial run at Dalian Port in Liaoning. The carrier was at first called the Varyag. It was built in the former Soviet Union. However, the Soviets failed to finish the ship. China bought the Varyag in 1998. Now after 10 trial runs, the aircraft carrier, renamed Liaoning, is in active service. Liaoning is about 300 meters long and 70 meters wide. It can take 30 planes and hold 2,000 soldiers. According to Xinhua News, Liaoning will be used for scientific research and military training. The aircraft carrier will help protect our country and promote world peace. The BBC said that Liaoning coming into service "" marks China as a rising power"". ,."	['September 25th.']

Which of the following can be the best title of the news text?	"BERLIN (AP)----A tiger escaped its enclosure at Cologne Zoo in western Germany on Saturday and killed a female keeper before being shot dead by the zoo's director, police said. The tiger slipped through a passage between the enclosure and a neighboring storage building, where it fatally attacked the 43-year-old keeper, said police spokesman Stefan Kirchner. ""It appears the gate wasn't properly shut,"" Kirchner told The Associated Press. The zoo was evacuated and a SWAT team was called in, police said.But before it arrived, the zoo's director managed to kill the tiger by climbing onto the storage building and shooting it through a skylight using a rifle. Kirchner said it was unlikely that members of the public had witnessed the incident. ""This is the darkest day of my life,"" the zoo's director, Theo Pagel, was quoted as saying by Cologne newspaper Express. The paper said on its website that the Siberian tiger was a 4-year-old male called Tltai that came to Cologne Zoo from an animal park in England.In November it fathered three cubs with a 7-year-old Siberian tiger called Hanya, according to the zoo's website. Police said the zoo reopened after Saturday's incident, which occurred around noon.However, a planned late-night opening of the zoo has been canceled. Cologne Zoo is one of the oldest in Germany.It was founded in 1860 and houses some 10,000 animals consisting of more than 700 different species."	['Tiger Escapes, Kills Keeper in German Zoo']
How many presidents are printed on the American money?	"Producing money requires both artistic and technological skills. Dollar bills are made so that they are interesting to look at but very hard to copy. In total, there are sixty-five separate steps required to make a dollar bill. The money making process begins when. a yearly order is sent by the Federal Reserve Board. That order will then be divided in half. Half will be done here in Washington, D. C.and the other half will be done in Fort Worth, Texas. Next, the Bureau orders special paper which is actually cloth since it is 75% cotton and 25% linen. This paper is made so that it can last a long time. And, it is made with details that make it hard to copy. For example, bills contain security threads. These narrow pieces of plastic are inside the paper and run along the width of the bill. This special paper is also made with very small blue and red fibers. Once the money is printed, guillotine cutters separate the sheets into two notes, then into individual notes. The notes are organized in ""bricks,"" each of which contains forty one-hundred-note packages. The bricks then go to one of twelve Federal Reserve Districts, which then give the money to local banks. Ninety-five percent of the bills printed each year are used to replace money that is in circulation, or that has already been removed from circulation. You may know that America's first president, George Washington, is pictured on the one- dollar bill. But do you know whose face is on the two, five, ten, twenty, fifty and one hundred-dollar bills? They are, in order. President Thomas Jefferson, President Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, President Andrew Jackson, President Ulysses Grant and statesman Benjamin Franklin. The average life span of a one-dollar bill is twenty-one months. But a ten-dollar bill lasts only about eighteen months. The one hundred-dollar bill lasts the longest, eighty-nine months. One popular question is about the two-dollar bill. This bill is not printed very often. This is because many Americans believe two-dollar bills are lucky, so they keep them."	['Five']
The author wrote the passage to _ .	"Barack Obama has never been shy about comparing himself with Abraham Lincoln. He did so when he announced his presidential election in Illinois, where both he and Lincoln served in the legislature . ""The life of a tall, thin, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible."" Obama said. ""He tells us that there is power in words and that there is power in hope."" Such comparisons have continued on big and small occasions, but the most important similarity, in Obama's mind, is how he plans to govern if elected. Obama says he admires Doris Kearns Goodwin' s wonderful Lincoln biography, Team of Rivals. ""He talks about it all the time."" says a top assistant. ""He is particularly interested in the idea that Lincoln successfully won the hearts of many people who had run against him for President, some of them even disagree with him firmly."" ""The lesson is that you shouldn't let your hatred get in the way of hiring ly the best people."" says Obama. ""I think American people are practical and so I have an interest in casting a wide net, seeking out people with a wide range of expert knowledge, including Republicans, for the highest positions in the government."" ""I don't want to have people who just agree with me."" He says. ""I want people who are continually pushing me forward and I'd be very interested in having those sorts of Republicans in my government, especially people who can speed up a responsible and logical conclusion to the Iraq war."""

The heroes in Varsity Blues and John Tucker Must Die are likely to be those who _ .	"Barack Obama, Lady Gaga and Steve Jobs--what do they have in common? They are, of course, all Americans. And according to a survey by social networking site badoo. com, they all best illustrate the word ""cool"". But just what does it mean to say someone is ""cool""? Most would answer that it is something to do with being independent-minded and not following the crowd. Yale University art professor Robert Farris Thompson says that the term ""cool"" goes back to 15th century West African philosophy . ""Cool"" relates to ideas of grace under pressure. ""In Africa, "" he writes, ""coolness is a positive quality which combines calmness, silence, and life. "" The modern idea of ""cool"" developed largely in the US in the period after World War II. ""Post-war 'cool' was in part an expression of war-weariness . . . it went against the strict social rules of the time, "" write sociologists Dick Pountain and David Robins in Cool Rules: Anatomy of an Attitude. But it was the American actor James Dean who became the symbol for ""cool"" in the hugely successful 1955 movie Rebel without a Cause. Dean plays a tough guy who disobeys his parents and the authorities . He always gets the girl, smokes cigarettes, wears a leather jacket and beats up bullies . In the movie, Dean showed what ""cool"" would mean to American young people for the next 60 years. Today the focus of ""cool"" has changed to athletics stars. Often in movies about schools, students gain popularity on the athletics field more than in the classroom. This can be seen quite clearly in movies like Varsity Blues and John Tucker Must Die. But many teenagers also think being smart is cool. Chess and other thinking games have been becoming more popular in schools. ""Call it the Harry Potterization of America --a time when being smart is the new cool, "" writes journalist Joe Sunnen."	['are very skilled at sports']
According to the author, the greatest mistake of our forefathers was that _ .	"The word ""conservation"" has a thrifty meaning. To conserve is to save and protect, to leave what we ourselves enjoy in such a good condition that others may also share the enjoyment. Our forefathers had no idea that human population would increase faster than the supplies of raw materials: most of them, even until very recently, had the foolish idea that the treasures were ""limitless"" and could ""last forever"". Most of the citizens of earlier generations knew little or nothing about the complicated and delicate system that runs all through nature, and which means that, as in a living body, an unhealthy condition of one part will sooner or later be harmful to all the others. Fifty years ago, nature study was not part of school work; scientific forestry was a new idea; wood was still cheap because it could be brought in any quantity from distant woodlands; soil destruction and river floods were not national problems; nobody had yet studied long-term climatic cycles in relation to proper land use; even the word ""conservation"" had nothing of the meaning that it has for us today. For the sake of ourselves and those who will come after us, we must now set about correcting the mistakes of our forefathers. Conservation should be made part of everybody's daily life. To know about the water table in ground is just as important to us as a knowledge of the basic math formulas . We need to know why all watersheds need the protection of plant life and why the running current of streams and rivers must be made to give their full benefit to the soil before they finally escape to the sea. We need to be taught the duty of planting trees as well as of cutting them. We need to know the importance of big, grown trees, because _ In a word, it should be our goal to restore as much of the original beauty of nature as we can."

Which statement can best describe the life of Nelson Mandela?	"His first fight was for the equal rights of black people in South Africa. Then, as the first black president he fought to unite the country and organize the government. Now Nelson Mandela has set his sights on a new enemy, AIDS. On March 19 the 82-year-old, former president, hosted his second AIDS-awareness concert. He warned that 25 million people in Africa were already infected with the fatal disease. Mandela was born in a small village in South Africa in 1918. He was adopted by the chief of his tribe and could have been a chief himself and lived a happy country life. But he refused to be a chief when his people lived under racial discrimination ( ). He decided to fight for equal rights for all the people in South Africa. Before 1990, under the country's Racial Segregation Law , colored and white people lived separately. Black people were treated unfairly even when taking a bus. Blacks had to stand at the back of the bus to make room for white people even when there were only a few of them on board. For his opposition to the system Mandela was arrested and spent 27 years in prison. He was freed in 1990 and become the president of the country after the first elections were held in which everyone could vote. Mandela was not only a political fighter who attacked with speeches. He was also a trained boxer and fought in the ring when he was young. "" Although I did not enjoy the violence of boxing, I was interested in how one moved one's body to protect oneself, how one used a strategy both to attack and retreat ,"" he wrote in his autobiography. As a skilful fighter, he chose music as his weapon against AIDS. He hopes to win another victory against AIDS."	['Struggle is his life.']
Which is the best title of the passage?	"Do you have any foreign friends? Do you know their characteristics ? The Germans are very quiet and they always keep calm.

They are really polite, so we often hear they say ""Thank you."" Or ""Sorry."" The gentlemen are also the Englishmen. The French's holidays are very long. They like traveling and usually spend their long time staying in other countries. The Frenchmen are more outgoing than the Germans. It is very easy to make friends with them. Compared to the Frenchmen, the Americans are more outgoing. And they are even opener than all of the Europeans. They don't like to depend on others.

According to the author,you are fortunate if you are not_.	"Do you feel lucky? You probably don't. You may think you've got where you are today through willpower and hard work. We tend to overlook luck's role,and this seems to get worse the richer we get; surveys show that the wealthiest are least likely to owe their fortunes to good fortune. Many such people oppose taxation and government spending: why should others get a handout if they don't need one? More often than not,they vote against the very policies that helped them get lucky to begin with. In a recent Atlantic essay,Robert Frank,an economist who has studied attitudes to chance,quoted EB White: ""Luck is not something you can mention in the presence of self-made men."" However, if we see this just as a problem of the super-rich people,we may let the rest of us off too easily. Anyone living in a highly developed economy in 2016 is already the one who benefits from luck--for example,not living in the modern-day Central African Republic, where few people can live a long life. In fact,we are lucky to have been born human. You might have been a battery hen,or a mayfly with only one day to live. Our blindness to such truths isn't only because we're self-absorbed but also we attach more significance to things that are easier to call to mind. It's not hard to recall countless times when you put in the effort to succeed: struggling through university finals,preparing for job interviews,tolerating a long-distance travel to work. On the other hand,it's rather difficult to realize you're privileged--like not being born in a war zone,or before antibiotics ,and so forth."	['living in a war zone']
The author presents this passage by _ .	My parents always raised me to have strong values and hold firm to my confidence in life, and this was never more proved than when a situation arose when it would be easy for most people to ignore it. A gentleman at my father's work smelled awful and neglected his behavior, and as the months went by, he showed signs of confusion. After being told to pick up papers at another building, he would be found sitting at his desk staring at his shoes; after being reminded (to which he would completely believe he hadn't been told the first time), he would be found once again sitting at his desk in the same position. This happened to worsening degrees over a few months and his coworkers either ignored it or were ignorant to this due to a lack of social association with the man. My father began to mentally record all of this and finally sat down with him one day when he was found two hours after work was out, sitting in his car, looking like he didn't know where to go. Apparently the gentleman was in the beginning/middle stages of Alzheimer's and there was someone who used his forgetfulness as a reason to ask him for money every few days. My father took this man to a hospital (for the first time in years) to be properly treated, and then got a caretaker to watch over his condition. He then went to the man's house and helped him sort out all of his financial matters and get his retirement set up; they went to the bank and had a government worker ensure that his bills would be paid for and his children would no longer get to treat him like a personal ATM. That my father took his much personal time to help another man that so many had forgotten or would choose to neglect, or even make fun of, truly shows his character.	['telling an instructive story']
Which of the following is TRUE about Talia?	"Each year, prizes are presented to adults who make great achievements in art, writing, science, and economics. So why not give awards to kids?

So what grabs your attention when seeing this particular piece of art? Well let's think...what gets your attention in any circumstance? Why is a stop sign bright red? That's right...Abstract Art, in most circumstances, is filled with color1s of all sorts that are meant to turn heads. These characteristics, along with others such as the paintings texture and other elements, are what make this form of art one of the most popular styles collected today. The creativity involved with these pieces of art brings upon a new imagination that some viewers didn't know existed within them. This art is from the heart and soul, instead of what you see is what you get. With that being said, you can now see that Abstract Art is more than just a thoughtless mess put on a canvas. _ 4 _ . While viewing the work of a very talented artist, Osnat Tzadok, I came across a quote of hers that states ""Every time I pass near a blank canvas I feel something explode inside of me. It is not something I can explain or pass on to someone else...but it is, always, a beginning of a new creation"". This quote of Osnat's perfectly portrays what we, the viewers, should feel when viewing an artist's abstract creation. Just as an artist gets this ""explosion"" that Osnat speaks of, we receive the same feeling when looking at their piece if we truly appreciate Abstract Art. The beauty of non-representational art is that we can create the story within the painting. We can ask ourselves, ""Why do these color1s interact with each other?"" or ""What does this symbolize?"".... and with those questions our imagination brings about answers."	['In most cases, Abstract Art is filled with color1s of all sorts that are meant to turn heads.']
What do you think would most probably happen next?	"Once upon a time a man became a great archer .He asked the king to _ him as the greatest archer of the country.The king was about to do so when an old servant of the king said,""Wait,sir.I know an old man who lives in the forest.He is a much greater archer.Let this young man go to him and learn from him for at least three years."" The man could not believe that there could be a greater archer than him,but he went and found the old man and he was! For three years he learned from him.Then one day, when he thought he had learned everything,the thought arose in him:""If I kill this old man,then 1 will be the greatest archer."" The old man had gone to cut wood and he was coming back carrying wood On his shoulder.The young man hid behind a tree,waiting to kill him.He shot an arrow.The old man took a small piece of wood and threw it.It struck the arrow and the arrow turned back and wounded the young man very deeply.The old man came,took Out the arrow and said. ""I knew that some day or other you were going to do this.That's why I have not taught you this secret.There is no need to kill me.My Master is still alive, and I'm nothing before him.You must be with him for at least thirty years.And he is very old, so go fast!

What is suggested in the report?	"Up to two-fifths of a food crop is often wasted because it is ""ugly"", a report on food waste has shown. Produce grown in the UK that does not meet retailer standards on appearance is often given to animals or thrown out even though it is healthy to eat. The report from the UK's global food security program also showed that the average household throws away more than 5kg of food a week, and nearly two-thirds of that waste is avoidable. The waste costs PS 480 a year per household on average, and PS 680 per family. Households throw away a fifth of the food they buy, wasting it for reasons ranging from cooking too much to not using it before it goes bad, the study showed. Consumption is the top area where food is wasted in the UK, the study said. Farmers respond to consumer demands for high-quality food with standards that can lead to the crop being wasted. Some supermarkets have started marketing ""odd shapes and sizes"" of fruit and vegetables, though. Also, more UK consumers are prepared to accept ""ugly"" fruit and vegetables, amid concerns over sustainability and food prices, the research said. In developing countries, much of the loss of food occurs during post-harvesting storage, processing and packaging. Tackling waste globally is necessary to feed a growing world population sustainably. One in eight people worldwide doesn't have enough food, the report said. Around a third of food produced globally is lost or wasted. Professor Tim Benton, an expert on food security at the University of Leeds, said: ""Over 5 million people in the UK live in poverty, where basic food provision is a daily challenge."" Nearly 400,000 people used food banks last year, according to the Trussell Trust. ""At the same time, 15 million tons of food is wasted annually, with nearly half thrown away within UK households. Reducing the scale of losses and waste throughout the food system is a crucial step."" The report highlights priorities for research to help reduce food waste, including improving harvesting and packaging technologies and seasonal weather prediction."

What is Nick's best quality?	Nick is a student. He has four friends. They are Ben, Eric, Peter and Andy. But they are all very different. Nick is confident and kind. He is also a good listener.

Which of the following statements do you think is true about the writer?	Contrary to many people believe, highly intelligent children are not necessarily certain to achieve academic success. In fact, so-called gifted students may fail to do well because they are unusually smart. Ensuring that a gifted child reaches his or her potential requires an understanding of what can go wrong and how to satisfy the unusual learning requirements of extremely bright young people. One common problem gifted kids face is that they, and those around them, place too much importance on being smart. Such an emphasis can encourage a belief that bright people do not have to work hard to do well. Although smart kids may not need to work hard in the lower grades, when the work is easy, they may struggle and perform poorly when the work gets harder because they do not make the effort to learn. If the academic achievement of highly intelligent children remains below average for an extended period, many teachers will fail to recognize their potential. As a result, such students may not get the encouragement they need, further depressing their desire to learn. They may fall far behind in their schoolwork and even develop behavior problems. IQ is just one element among many in the recipe for success--Children develop well or struggle in school for a host of reasons apart from IQ. These include motivation and persistence, social competence, and the support of family, educators and friends. Because highly gifted children solve the most varied thought problems faster and more thoroughly than those with more average talents do, they need additional intellectual stimulation while they wait for the rest of the kids to learn the basics. Two central approaches are used to satisfy the educational needs of such children: acceleration and enrichment. Acceleration means studying material that is part of the standard subjects for older students. Enrichment involves learning information that falls outside the usual subjects. A child might skip one or more grades as a way of accelerating in school. But being with older children for the entire school day--and perhaps for grade-based extracurricular activities such as sports--can make a child feel inferior in every filed outside of academics. One very bright fourth-grader who had skipped two grades remained far ahead of his classmates intellectually, but as his classmates reached adolescence, his social and other shortcomings became painfully apparent. While acceleration is not an option, or not a good one, enrichment can be. After all, school is not a race but an adventure in learning. As such, the goal is not finishing first but absorbing as much knowledge as possible in the time assigned. Thus, providing opportunities for a child to study topics outside the regular subjects can be at least as valuable as pushing him or her through the required material faster.	['He is in favor of enrichment rather than acceleration.']
Which of the following is True about Peter Garden?	"The largest campaign of killing rats in history is set to poison millions of rats on the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. Scientists say the campaign planned for 2013 and 2014 will restore beautiful South Georgia to the position it once held as the world's most important nesting sites for seabirds. It was sailors in the late 18th century who unintentionally introduced rats to what had been a fresh environment. ""If we can destroy the rats, at least 100 million birds will return to their home on South Georgia,"" says Tony Martin, a biology professor at the University of Dundee who was invited to lead the project. South Georgia is by far the largest island to get rid of animals that destroy native wildlife after being introduced deliberately or accidentally by people. Though rats and mice have done the most damage, cats, foxes, goats, deer, rabbits and other species have been targeted in the campaigns around the world. South Georgia is seven times the size of New Zealand's Campbell Island, currently the largest area ever killing rats. The successful war against Campbell Island rats was carried out in 2001 with 132 tons of poison dropped from five helicopters. ""New Zealand pioneered the techniques for ridding islands of rats and in fact our operation on South Georgia is based on New Zealand's technology."" Says Martin. ""Some New Zealanders will be helping our campaign, including our chief pilot, Peter Garden, who was also chief pilot for the projects at Campbell Island and Rat Island, in the Aleutian chain of the north Pacific."" The second and third stages in 2013 and 2014 will involve dropping as much as 300 tons of poison from the air onto every part of the island where rats might live. It is a huge operation, carried out during the stormy southern autumn when the rats are hungry and the risks of poisoning native wildlife are less than in the spring and summer months. ""Ideally we'd do in winter but the weather makes that too risky,"" Martin says. The ecological payback will be priceless. But Martin says, ""The full benefits will take decades to arrive, because some of these birds are slow to hatch."""	['He made great contributions to the project at Campbell Island and Rat Island.']
The main reason for one's poor memory is that _ .	If you do not use your arm or your legs for some time, they become weak; when you start using them again, they slowly become strong again. Everybody knows that. Yet many people do not seem to know that memory works in the same way. When someone says that he has a good memory, he really means that he keeps his memory in practice by using it. When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he does not give it enough chance to become strong. If a friend says that his arms and legs are weak, we know that it is his own fault . But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think that his parents are to blame , and few of us know that it is just his own fault. Have you ever found that some people can't read or write but usually they have better memories? This is because they cannot read or write and they have to remember things they cannot write down in a little notebook. They have to remember days, names, songs and stories; so their memory is the whole time being exercised. So if you want to have a good memory, learn from the people: Practice remembering.	['his memory is not often used']
If a man wearing suit and a tie is climbing a mountain, what can we say to him according to the passage?	"You must have a favorite line or _ you repeat often in your conversations. Studies say that pet phrases can reflect our changing society and reveal information about a person's personality. Here are some of the most popular pet phrases among young people. ---nuts I love the word and use it whenever I think a person is stupid, or a behavior is crazy. I learned the term from one of my classmates. Once, we saw two high school girls wearing miniskirts on a very cold winter day and my classmate called the two girls ""nuts"". I don't think the word reflects my personality. I use it because it sounds cool. Diao Yujie, 22, computer science major at Nanjing University. ---stunning I use this word very often. Once, my classmates and I were discussing how amusing QQ is. One guy suddenly burst out, ""I have MSN too"". This comment had no relation with the topic we were discussing. I used this word and everybody laughed. I think it is a fantastic word that can change awkwardness to amusement. Mu Li, 20, journalism major at Beijing Normal University. ---I'm giddy! I use this word a lot---more often than my classmates. It has became a symbol of me, as my friends sometimes refer to me as the guy who often says the word. I am a person who wants to be different and this word gives me that feeling. Chen Zhou, 21, Nanjing University. ---stunning I only use this word with my friends. My parents don't understand it. The word, which is only used among people of my age, is intimate. I think it stands for being young and energetic. And I want to be young forever, so I like the word. Chen Jianjun, 23, senior at Nanjing University."	['nuts']
In France, if you raise your hand and make a circle with the thumb and the second finger, it means _ .	"We always use body language in our daily life. When we have a talk with someone, we may use more body language than words. However, the same body language may mean different things in different countries. That's why people sometimes do not understand each other correctly. Pointing to one part of the body can mean differently in different cultures. For example, in the USA people point to their heads when they think someone is clever. However, in Europe it means ""He or she is stupid or something is wrong with his or her head"" .In China, nodding heads means ""Yes"" and shaking heads means ""No"". However, in parts of Greece and Turkey, they mean just the opposite. In England or the USA, when you raise your hand and make a circle with the thumb and the second finger, it means ""Everything is OK."" However, if you do this in France or Belgium, it means ""You're worth zero."" In Greece or Turkey, you should not make this gesture, or you are thought to be very rude. The meaning of gestures can also change over time. In the 1960s, the V sign meant ""peace"". However, during World War II, it meant ""victory"". In Greece, it is a very insulting sign. Though the meaning of body language is different, there are some expressions having the same meaning throughout the world."	['you are worth nothing']
Kao zha is a good dish that is made with _ .	My parents taught me not to waste food. My mum always found ways to make leftovers taste good. I went to YiLan to learn about some of their special food. As I was there, I learned about the food and the history of the area. I learned that they don't waste food, either, and they use leftovers! Many years ago, there was not enough food for everyone. People learned to cook and eat almost everything. They had to think of ways to make special dishes. One of these dishes is kao zha.It made with leftovers like meat, soup, oil and fat. That might not sound very good, but it does taste good. Today, kao zha is a special dish at big banquets . Another famous dish is called zao bing. It's made with fruit, meat and other things. I really liked it! But I didn't want to eat too much. It has a lot of fat in it. I smelled something burning and I saw smoke, so I found another special food of the YiLan area duck meat. The duck meat is put in a big oven to cook it. Smoke keeps the meat fresh. I don't usually eat meat, but this duck meat was delicious! It tasted sweet. YiLan is a great place with delicious food. I hope I can come back again!	['somedifferentleftovers']
The writer thinks _ .	Many kids go to day camp during the summer. They can have a lot of fun, but the _ is almost the same. You start camp in the morning and go home in the afternoon. Sometimes, a bus takes you there or you might get a ride there. It might take you some time to like the place, the camp teacher, and the kids. But you go home every night, just like what you do during the school year. Sleepaway camp makes you feel more excited because you'll be there all day. It's a kind of holiday, but without your parents. You'll sleep in adormitory with other kids of the camp. You'll eat together in a large dining hall and you'll share the bathroom with other kids. Some sleepaway camps are coed. That means there are both boys and girls at the camp. Some camps are just for girls or just for boys, but often these all-girl and all-boy camps meet up for dances and parties.	['sleepaway camp is more exciting']
The purpose of the campaign is to _ .	"Getting in touch with nature can help keep people fit, reducing the burden of sickness on the health service, conservation experts say. Natural England is starting a campaign to get people to spend more time outside among the country's wildlife and natural environment. The aim of the campaign is to get people to have more contact with nature by promoting green spaces and encouraging health professionals to incorporate (......) the thought into the advice and care plans that they give to patients. Being close to nature can cut stress and increase physical activity. Dr. William Bird from Natural England said: ""Increasing evidence suggests that both physical and mental health are improved through contact with nature. Yet people are having less contact with nature than at any time in the past. This has to change. Children with attention disorders have been shown to improve when they have contact with nature. People recovering from operations have been shown to need fewer painkillers if they look out at green fields."" He also said people were more likely to keep up with their regular exercise in natural settings, rather than in a gym or leisure centre. Natural England is working with the BBC and more than 300 partners to promote its campaign, which will be the first of four campaigns to get people more involved in nature. Liz Cleaver, from the BBC, said: ""These campaigns now provide the public with the opportunity to get outside and to get actively involved in nature close to where they live. That's great for wildlife --but it's also fantastic for everyone's health and well-being."" The campaign has also received support from the government. Dr. Fiona Adshead, England's deputy chief medical officer, said: ""I welcome Natural England's commitment to encourage and enable people to make use of the country's outdoor space for physical activity."""

Inspiration to solve a difficult problem will most probably come to us _ .	"Our body clock,or natural body rhythm,influences our energy and alertness.Paying attention to it can help us choose the suitable time of day when we best perform specific tasks. The reality,however,is that most of us organize their time around work demands,school deadlines,commuting or social events.Doing whatever your body feels like doing is a luxury in today's fast-paced modem society. But that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying.Obeying our body clock has significant health benefits.Disrupting our natural body rhythm,on the other hand,has been linked to problems such as depression,obesity,or headache,says Steve Key,a biology professor. When the body clock can synchronize(......)the rhythms of its natural processes,it ""gives us an advantage in daily life"",says Key. According to him,when it comes to cognitive work,most adults perform best in the late morning.As our body temperature starts to rise just before awakening in the morning and continues to increase until midday,our memory,alertness and concentration gradually improve. However,he adds,our ability to concentrate typically starts to decrease soon thereafter.Most of us are more easily distracted between noon and 4 pm. Alertness also tends to fall after eating a meal and sleepiness tends to peak around 2 pm,making that a good time for a nap. Surprisingly, tiredness may increase our creative powers.For most adults,problems that require open ended thinking are often best dealt with in the evening when they are tired, according to a study in the journal Thinking & Reasoning. When choosing a time of day to exercise,paying attention to your body clock can improve results.Physical performance is usually best from about 3 to 6 pm,says Michael Smolensky,a professor of biomedical engineering. Of course, not everyone's body clock is the same,making it even harder to synchronize natural rhythms with daily plans."	['when we are tired in the evening']
Dr. Cleiman did not explain in the passage _ .	"Recently Dr. Cleiman has proved that everyone has a daily energy cycle. During the hours when you labor (work) through your work, you may say that you are ""hot"". That is true, the time of day when you feel most energetic is when your cycle of body temperature is at its peak . For some people the peak comes during the forenoon . For others it comes in the afternoon or evening. No one has discovered why this is so. Much family quarrelling ends when husbands and wives realize what this energy cycle means and which cycle each member of the family has. You cannot change your cycle, but you can learn to make your life fit it better. ""Habits can help,"" Dr. Cleiman believes. If your energy cycle is low in the morning but you have an important job early in the day, rise before your usual hour, and then you will work better at your low point. Get off to a slow start which saves your energy. Get up with a lazy yawn and stretch . Sit on the edge of bed before putting your feet on the floor. Avoid the troublesome searching for clean clothes by laying them out the night before."	['why people have their energy cycle at different times']
Which of the following descriptions about Yves Gomes is true?	"Yves Gomes is now a university student in Maryland, but he may soon have to leave the country. ""I still want to continue with my college education and I want to be able to study here and go to medical school,"" he said. Gomes is one of thousands of young illegal immigrants who grew up in the United States and are now studying at American colleges and universities. He is doing well in his studies, but he is fighting deportation to India, a country he left with his parents when he was just 14 months old. They were deported more than a year ago. ""If I was to go back to India I would just feel like all of that would have gone to waste because here at least I am still able to go to college,"" he said. Immigration is a divisive political issue in the United States with some 11 million people in the country illegally. One element of the debate is the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16. Pending legislation know as the DREAMAct would give them a chance to become legal residents if they complete two years of college or join the military. Milanie Schwartz, a politically conservative student at the University of Texas, explains why some Americans oppose the legislation. ""We think it's unfair that students who are illegal immigrants would get a fast track to citizenship, while people who did come here legally wouldn't have those same opportunities,"" she said. ""The question is legalization or not, "" said Jon Feere, who also opposes the DREAM Act. He is a policy analyst with the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington and is concerned about the act's effect on the economy. ""There's a lot of unemployment in the United States right now. And there are already many legal immigrants who are already here who are desperate for those jobs,"" he said. But supporters of the DREAMAct say well-educated immigrants would help the economy. Raul Hinojosa is an immigration research analyst at UCLA."" Not letting them contribute to the economy would not only lose all the financial investment we have already made in these youths, but we would lose literally trillions of dollars of potential value because they want and are ready to contribute to the US economy,"" he said. That's exactly what Yves Gomes wants to do -- finish school and become a doctor. He says without the DREAMAct, many students' dreams will be lost. ""They are studying at Harvard, they are studying at UCLA--the top universities -- and they all have bright futures and because of the system they are going to be told to go home, go back to a country they don't even know, "" he said. The DREAMAct has failed to win passage in Congress since it was first introduced 10 years ago. Now time is running out for passage this year, and opposition Republicans have threatened to block it. Yves Gomes hopes that won't happen. He wants to finish school and eventually become a US citizen."	['He was born in India before his parents immigrated to America illegally.']

We can infer from the story that the author	"It was six or seyen years ago that I first witnessed a ginger cat break into my house.His name was Samson and, while""cat''was one description you might have applied to him, another more accurate one was""ginger beach ball that just happened to have a cat's head on top"".He belonged to Ruby,a lady in her 80s living across the road.Soon the two of us became friends:me allowing him to steal my cat's biscuits,him allowing me to stroke him while staring up at me in a relaxed way.If he had been able to speak,the maj ority of his sentences would have ended in the word""dude"" .

In the past two and a half years,I've been visited by a succession of ginger cats,all of whom have been lovable,and all of whom have proved costly in either an emotional or financial sense. I'm moving out soon and facing up to the fact that I might never see them again.I've told the buver of my house about the essential information of it,especially the visiting cats.The chances are that one day if a cat,whether it is from one of the neighbours or just a stray one,turns up by his doorway,he can at least feed it."

Mauritiusis _ .	"Any mistake, which is made in the printing of a stamp, raises its value to stamp collectors. A mistake on a two-penny stamp has made it worth a million and a half times its face value. Do you think it possible? However, it is true. The mistake was made more than 100 years ago in Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean, which was a British colony at that time. In 1847, an order for stamps was sent to London. Thus prefix = st1 /Mauritiusbecame the fourth country in the world which had the stamps made in other countries. Before the order was filled ,that is, the stamps arrived from England, a big dance party was planned by the commander-in-chief of all the armed forces on the island. The party would be held in his house and letters of invitation would be sent to all the important people in Mauritius. So stamps were badly needed to post the letters. Therefore, an islander, who was a good printer, was told to copy the pattern of the stamps. He carelessly put the words ""Post Office"" instead of ""Post Paid"", two words seen on the stamps at that time, on several hundred that he printed. Today, there are only 26 of these misprinted stamps left: fourteen One-penny Reds and twelve Two-penny Blues. Because of so few Two-penny Blues and because of their age, collectors have paid as much as $16,800 for each of them."	['the name of a country in the Indian Ocean']
The purpose of the passage is to _ .	"Many parents have learned the hard way that what sounds like open communication is often the very thing that closes a youngster`s ears and mouth. One common mistake is the The Lecture, the long _ that often starts with ""When I was your age...."" Eighteen-year-old Kelly calls lectures ""long, one-side discussions in which I don`t say much."" Kids reflexively shut down in the face of a lecture. Their eyes glaze over, and they don`t register any incoming information. Listen to 13-year-old Sarah describe her least favorite times with her mom and dad. ""First, they scream. Then comes the 'We`re so disappointed' speech. Then the 'I never did that to my parents' lecture begins. After that, even if they realize how ridiculous they sound, they never take it back."" Lines like ""When you have children of your own, you`ll understand"" have been seriously said by parents since time immemorial. But many of our expert parents, like Bobby, a registered nurse and mother of three, feel that by falling back on cliches to justify our actions, we weaken our position. Since kids are creatures of the here and now, the far-off future has no relevance to them. Therefore, good communicators like Bobby suggest, ""Give specific reasons for your actions in present language: 'I`m not letting you go to the party because I don`t think there will be enough adult supervisions .'"" Betty, who lives in Missiouri, uses an indirect approach. ""I find that warnings are accepted more readily if I discuss a news article on a subject I am concerned about. My husband and I talk about it while our children absorb the information. Then they never think I`m preaching."" This really helped when Betty`s kids began driving. Instead of constantly repeating ""Don`t drink; don`t speed,"" she would talk about articles in the paper and express sympathy for the victims of a car crash. Betty made no special effort to draw her kids into the conversation. She depended on a teen-ager`s strong desire to put in his opinions---especially if he thinks he isn`t being asked for them."

The best title for the passage would be _ .	"Recently, a young man saw a beggar at a street in Chongqing. ""I know you. Let me take a picture of you."" With the words, the young man took a picture and then gave him ten yuan. The beggar is named Xia Haibo, born in Hubei Province.

As a beggar, he has opened his blog on the Internet and his blog has been clicked more than 500,000 times now. He likes reading---he has read a lot of poems written by Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore. He has also read many old Chinese poems. He has kept writing and recently, he planned to publicize his writings. As a beggar, he is so special that many people call him ""the greatest beggar in history"".

Form the passage we can infer that .	English is a language spoken all around the world. There are more than 42 countries where the majority of the people speak English. Most native speakers of English are found in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Ireland and New Zealand. In total, for more than 375 million people, English is their mother tongue. An equal number of people learn English as a second language. These people will perhaps speak the language of their own country at home with their family, but the language of the government, schools, newspapers and TV is English. However, the number of people who learn English as a foreign language is more than 750 million. Everywhere in the world children go to school to learn English. In China, students learn English at school as a foreign language, except for those in hong Kong, where many people speak English as a first or a second language. In only fifty years, English has developed into the language most widely spoken and used in the world. English is the working language of most international organizations, international trade and tourism. English is also the language of global culture, such as popular music and the Internet. You can listen to English songs on the radio or use English to communicate with people around the world through the Internet. With so many people communicating in English every day, it will become more and more important to have a good knowledge of English.	['to master English will become more and more important']
What did the author decide to treat himself to?	"I decided a few months ago that l was going to treat myself to a 4-day getaway from Los Angeles and visit Chicago. I turned in some long-saved frequent flier miles for the airplane ticket, but had to shell out cash I really couldn't afford for the hotel. I found a travel website where a discounted promotional 3-night stay was purchased from a recently opened hotel. About three weeks before the trip, I had to regretfully cancel and only then realized the room, while transferable to another person, couldn't be changed to a later date and wasn't refundable .For the next two weeks, I tried selling it on Craig's list with no success. Five days before the ""big weekend"" I gave up trying to spend any money and decided I'd contact some friends who live in Chicago and offer someone a free ""staycation"". After trying a handful of people all of whom already had their own plans, I was determined to have the room not go to waste. That's when it suddenly occurred to me that I was looking at the rooms in the wrong way. Instead of viewing them for vacation purposes, surely there must be a way to put them to good use, and that was when the idea that some sort of shelter might be able to use it hit me. I finally found one whose focus is aiding victims of domestic violence. This particular one was willing to listen to my out-of-left-field story and facilitated the transfer of the rooms. The shelter was working with a desperate woman and her young daughter, who were fortunately able to make use of the room."	['A 4-day travel.']
Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"If you had only three years left to live, how would you spend your time? It's a hard question and few of us would even like to think about it. But 18-year-old Huang Ge has to answer this question and he says, ""I want to thank the people who have helped me."" At the age of one, Huang's mother left the family. Six years later, he was badly ill. He has been using a wheelchair since 9 years old. Doctors said he would only live to 18.After Huang's story went on TV, hundreds of people sent money to help him. The boy was so moved that he decided to thank every one of them. But he has to be tied to his wheelchair. And the family can only afford a three-wheeled motorcycle . Since 2003, the father and son have traveled 14,000 kilometers, to 10 provinces, and thanked more than 30 helpers. ""I am moved by the story of the boy. We need the courage to face death, and we should also show our gratefulness to those who help us,"" says an online post on CCTV. com."	['Huang Ge was badly ill at the age of one.']
According to Paragraph One, which of the following is TRUE?	Liu Xiang, a 21-year-old Chinese athlete, got the gold medal of the fascinating men's 110m hurdles before a crowd of 70,000 at the Olympic Stadium in the 28th Olympics in Athens late Friday local time. He clocked an excellent 12.91 seconds to equal the world record set by Britain's Collin Jackson in 1993. It is the first gold Chinese men's athlete has ever won from the track and field in the Olympics history. China has won over 100 gold medals from the summer Olympic Games since 1984 but its male athletes only got one medal from Olympics' most popular sport, the track and field. The Shanghai native, with his father a truck driver and mother an out-of-work housewife, loved sports when he was very little. Liu was selected to the Junior Sports School of Putuo District of Shanghai to practice jumping as a fourth grader in the primary school. But after a bone test showing that he will not be able to become a tall man, Liu was asked to give up sports one year later, although he had won the national champion at that level. In 1998 when he attracted coach Sun Haiping's attention as a 15-year-old jumper, Sun was a well-known hurdle coach and he believed a star was born at the first sight of Liu. He visited Liu's parents several times and finally persuaded them to let Liu transfer to the 110m hurdles. After only three years, Liu launched his career in style in the IAAF Grand Prix in Lausanne in 2001 by breaking the world youth and Asian record with a time of 13.12. But the first warning he sent to the world was his bronze-winning feat at the world indoor championships in Birmingham, England, last year. In 2004, Liu won the silver in the world indoor championships in Budapest in March. Two months later, he proved the winner in a race against American great Allen Johnson in the IAAF Grand Prix in Osaka, Japan, where he clocked a new Asian record and world's season best time of 13.06 seconds. He went on to win two Johnson-absent races in Lille, France, on June 26 and Zagreb, Croatia, three days later. He put up an exciting show at the Golden Gala meet in Rome on July 3, when he and Johnson clocked an identical time of 13.11. Race officials had to examine a photo finish to declare Johnson the winner. Liu did a better job of clearing the hurdles than Johnson, but Johnson's stronger start ended up making the difference. The race boosted Liu's optimism for the Olympics, although Johnson bettered his season best time by 0.01 second in Lausanne, Switzerland, on July 6. The world has put the Olympics a Johnson-Liu but surprisingly Johnson crashed out of the Games after falling at the ninth hurdle at round 2. Johnson's early exit paved the way for Liu's win. He finally took the gold medal and put a Chinese man's name on the record book.

When a consumer finds that his or her purchase has a fault in it, the first thing he or she should do is to _ .	"When a consumer finds that an item she or he bought is faulty or in some other way does not live up to the manufacturer's claims, the first step is to present the warranty, or any other records which might help at the store of purchase. In most cases, this action will produce results. However, if it does not, there are various means the consumer may use to gain satisfaction. A simple and common method used by many consumers is to complain directly to the store manager. In general, the ""higher up"" his or her complaint, the faster he or she can expect it to be settled. In such a case, it is usually settled in the consumer's favor, assuming he or she has a just claim. Consumers should complain in person whenever possible, but if they cannot get to the place of purchase, it is acceptable to phone or write the complaint in a letter. Complaining is usually most effective when it is done politely but firmly, and especially when the consumer can demonstrate what is wrong with the item in question. If this cannot be done, the consumer will succeed best by presenting specific information as to what is wrong, rather than by making general statements. For example, ""The left speaker does not work at all and the sound coming out of the right one is unclear"" is better than ""This stereo does not work"". The store manager may advise the consumer to write to the manufacturer. If so, the consumer should do this, stating the complaint as politely and firmly as possible. If a polite complaint does not achieve the desired result, the consumer can go to a step further. She or he can threaten to take the seller to court or report the seller to a private or public organization responsible for protecting consumer's rights."

Which of the statements is true of my uncle?	"My aunt died back in about 2003. She was eighty-four and so was my uncle. When she passed he felt miserable. They had been married for over 60 years. After my aunt's death, he attended his church more frequently and his mourning was nearly unbearable to witness. His only daughter lived clear across the country in the south so he had only himself to make a comfort. My cousin talked him into selling the house that he and my aunt had built together about twenty-five years before. It was very hard to part with the home they built together. One day he called my cousin who was living in Texas and told her that he reconnected with a lady from a church that he and my aunt went to forty years previously. She played the piano and his church was looking for new music. Her husband had died about seven years previously. He said he just wanted someone to go out to dinner with and spend time with. We were happy for them but had no idea how it would turn out. They were both almost eighty-seven years old. They were like lovebirds and spent as much time together as they could. They both had one child each, she a son, he a daughter. The conflict in their relationship came one day when they neither wanted to leave their respective churches. Before too long they realized that they did not want to be apart. They would find a new church together. They planned to marry. When he took her to a jewelry store and bought her a diamond, the employees were so impressed that they had a big write up in our own local paper, ""The 'Truth for Valentines' Day. "" They prepared for their wedding. They moved the wedding date up because neither wanted to wait any longer to ""be together"". They got married in her house, where her first marriage took place. It was such a beautiful refreshing thing to see, two people who you would have thought had pretty much lived their lives, were beginning a new one together."	['His conflict with the lady arose in that they were both attached to their own churches.']
Where can this passage most probably be found?	"For medical students, real experience begins not in a classroom but at a teaching hospital. These doctors in training are guided. But sometimes accidents happen and the students get injured. For example, they might stick themselves with a needle while treating patients. Such needle sticks are common. But a recent study found that medical students often fail to report them. Failing to report an injury like this can be dangerous if a patient, or a medical worker, has an infectious disease. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, did the study, which involved a survey answered by almost 700 surgeons in training in the United States. Almost 60% said they had suffered needle stick injuries when they were in medical school. Many said they were stuck more than once. Yet nearly half of those whose most recent incident happened in school did not report it to a health office. If they had, they would have been tested to see if they needed treatment to prevent an infection like HIV or hepatitis. Most known cases of HIV or hepatitis are reported, but other possible infections often are not. Martin Makary, the lead author of the study, says medical students who are stuck put themselves and others in danger from infectious diseases. Doctor Makary said, ""A needle that goes through the skin needs to be as sharp as possible."" Doctors in training may have to do hundreds of stitches in some cases to close the skin after an operation. Doctor Makary said, ""I support using _ tip needles which are considered safer. This needle is still sharp enough to go through body tissue, but it does have a blunt tip, so that if it accidentally goes into my finger, it's much less likely to hurt me."" How common are needle sticks among health care workers? An estimated 600,000 to 800,000 of these and similar injuries are reported each year in the United States. But Doctor Makary says the real number may be much higher. The study advises doctors to protect their hands by wearing two sets of gloves. It also urges hospitals to establish a special telephone number for medical workers and students to call if they are injured. The idea is for hospitals to send a clear message that there is no reason not to report this kind of accident."	['In a science magazine']
The writer suggests giving a call to parents on Christmas mainly to _ .	When I spent Christmas away from home in Europe for the first time, I was only 14 and it was absolutely terrible. I am now married and live in the US. So there is little possibility for me to go home for Christmas. Now I am able to get through Christmas with some moments of joy: First, you are advised to search your area for stores that carry items from your home country or town. Buy food, candles and some other things that mean something to you. Hold on to the traditions from your home that you think are important even if other people think they are stupid. But keep in mind to be open for new traditions from wherever you might be, because those traditions are as important to those people around you as yours are to you. For me that includes celebrating Christmas on the 24th. Call, write Christmas cards, buy gifts and mail them to loved ones, just as if you were there. If you try to pretend as if the holiday doesn't exist, you are just going to make it worse. Introduce your traditions to your loved ones, especially your kids. It will only enrich their celebration of the holiday to have some unique traditions in their home. Little by little it will become their tradition and it's fun for them to try something new. Find clubs, churches or organizations that are from your home country. Chances are that they will have some celebration with some of your traditions which you can join in. Food is one of the most important factors in any kind of tradition. Find the recipe of that cake your grandmother used and make it your tradition to bake that particular cake. Call up your parents and get them to send you some of your favorite childhood ornaments for your tree. Pay attention to new traditions, talk to your family about which ones you want to make your own and stick with them. If you are far away from home, Christmas can never be the same as you experienced it before, but it is important to remember these traditions while appreciating the new ones. Keep an open mind and find a compromise between old and new traditions.	['ask for some ornaments']

It may be less important to sleep than to _ .	""" Dreams may be more important than sleep. We all need to dream."" some scientists say. Dreams take up about one quarter of our sleeping time. People have several dreams each night. Dreams are like short films. They are usually in color. Some dreams are like old films. They come up over and over again. That may be the dreamer worrying about something. Dreaming may be a way of trying to find an answer. Some people get new ideas about their work from dreams. They may have been thinking about their work all day. These thoughts can carry over into dreams. Too much dreaming can be harmful. The more we sleep,the longer we dream. The mind is still at work when we dream. That is why we may have a long sleep and still wake up tired."	['dream']
Which of the following statement is NOT TRUE?	Football The game is played by two teams. There must be eleven players in each team. The field must be about 100m long and 73m wide. There are two goals , 7.32m long and 2.44m high. To score a goal, a player must put the ball into the other team's goal.

What could a driver do in America when turning left?	"Driving In America Keep Right The traffic follows the ""keep right rule"". While driving, drive on the right side of the road. On one-way, multiple lanes road, the right-most lane would be slowest and left-most lane is fastest. Hand Signals Though indicators are used for the purpose of showing which direction you are going, knowing some hand signals is very important and are usually always asked in a driving test. When you want to turn right, you can put your left hand out of the window and point upward. When you want to make a left turn, you can reach your left arm out of the window and point to the left. If you want to slow down or stop, you can just point downward. School Buses Yellow school buses have flashing red lights and stop signs that reach out from the driver's side. The drivers use these warning signals when letting pupils on and off. No matter which side of the road you are traveling on, if you come upon a school bus with its lights flashing and a stop sign used, you must stop. It's the law. Remain stopped until the lights stop flashing or the stop sign is removed. Using the Horn Using horns is not common in America. Actually they are very rarely used. You may use your horn to warn walkers or other drivers of possible trouble or to avoid accidents. Do not use your horn to express anger or complain about other drivers' mistakes or to try to get a slow driver to move faster."	['Reach left arm out of the window pointing to the left.']

What does the passage mainly discuss?	"My house is made of wood, glass and stone. It is also made of software. If you come to visit, you'll probably be surprised when you come in: Someone will give you an electronic PIN to wear. The PIN tells the house who you are and where you are. The house uses this information to give you what you need. When it's dark outside, the PIN turns on the lights near you, and then turns them off as you walk away from them. Music moves with you, too. If the house knows your favorite music, it plays it for you. The music seems to be everywhere, but in fact other people in the house hear different music or no music. If you get a telephone call, only the nearest telephone rings. Of course, you are also able to want something. There is a home control console which is a small machine that turns things on and off around you. The PIN and the console are new ideas, but they are in fact like many things we have today. If you want to go to a movie, you need a ticket. If I give you the key to my car, you can use my car. The car works for you because you have the key. My house works for you because you wear the PIN or hold the console. I believe that in ten years from now, most new houses will have the systems that I've put in my house. The systems will probably be even bigger and better than the ones I've got. I like to try new ideas. I know that some of my ideas will work better than others'. But I hope that one day I will stop thinking of these systems as new, and ask myself instead, ""How did I live without them?"""	['Easy life in the future.']

"A new word is becoming more and more popular on the Internet in China - but no one knows quite what it means.The word ""duang"" is so new that you can't even find it in the Chinese dictionary. But it has already spread like fire on the Chinese Internet , appearing more than 8,000,000 times on Weibo, where 15,000 users had more than 312,000 discussions. On Baidu, it has been looked up almost 600,000 times. But what does it mean? ""Everyone's duang-ing and I still don't know what it means! Looks like I'd better go back to school now,"" said Weibo user Fahmida. Another user asked: ""Have you duang-ed today? My mind is full of duang duang duang."" ""To duang or not to duang, that is the question,"" wrote user Beatrice. ""Duang"" seems to be imitating a sound. It all seems to have started with Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan, who in 2004 appeared in a shampoo ad where he used the sound ""duang"" to describe his soft and black hair. The word came to people again recently after Chan posted it on his Weibo page. Thousands of users then began to visit Chan's Weibo page with comments . The word seems to have many different meanings, and there's no perfect Chinese meaning for it, but you could use it to give emphasis to the word that follows it.

Only _ of the land is fit for farming because of the cold northern climate.	Canada, the second largest country in the world, lies in the north of America. The population of Canada is about 29 million and the capital is Ottawa. The country covers about 9,980,000 square kilometers and six of the world's 24 time areas as well. There are two official languages spoken in Canada: French and English. Many people can speak both English and French. More than 60% of Canadians speak English as their language. About 25% of the Canadians speak French. In one province of Canada where French is the common language, the programmes on TV and radios as well as the teaching in schools are all in French. Today, Chinese has become the first inofficial language in Canada. Canada's climate is not as cold all year around as some may believe. In winter, temperatures fall below freezing point throughout most of Canada. In summer, the southern provinces often experience high levels of temperatures that can reach over 30degC regularly. The weather in Canada is just like the weather in China. It is rather cold in the north while it is fairly warm in the south. Winters in the north last long with snow for half a year. As the cold northern climate, only one-fifth of the land is suitable for farming. As it is known to all, Canada has one-third of the world's supply of fresh water. It has many great lakes. There are five great lakes in the south. And there are many others, especially in the north. It is also rich in natural resources, such as coal, oil, natural gas of which Canadians make use to produce energy. People of northern Canada are called Inuit , who came from Asia and settled in Canada about 4,000 years ago. They used to travel around from place to place with teams of dogs which pulled their baggage. Now, they seldom move. There are about 2,500 Inuit in all. The government has started a new school project in which Inuit teach their own young children. So it is hoped that the way of Inuit life will be kept alive for more centuries.	['20%']
t's very clear that the writer did _ .	Hearing the front door open, I ran down to the kitchen and waited. I saw my dad come in, with the white envelope in his hand. I had waited all day for this, so I reached over him for it as soon as he set foot into the house. Angrily, he threw the envelope on the table and said it was nothing to get excited about, and that it was just a piece of paper. I took it and ran upstairs. I wondered why my dad did not understand how anxious I was to see my mid-year report card for my first year in middle school. I was really hurt by how he refused to consider all my hard work. I saw my class grade: No. 1. I did not believe what I was. I smiled and wanted to run downstairs to tell everyone. Then I remembered what my dad had said--it was nothing to get excited about. I wanted to share my happiness with someone, but felt lonely. I realized that I stayed away from my family we used to stay up late watching Disney movies, and my brothers, sisters and I would play tennis in the backyard all the time. I wondered when all that stopped. I just no longer took part in them. I spent all my time on my school work. While I had been busy with my study, I had also built a wall between me and my family. I was only trying to become a person everyone could be proud of. I wanted to go downstairs, say sorry for my rude behavior and for every refused movie and tennis game, and be part of my family again. I knew I had to do something--because without their support, my achievement meant nothing.	['a lot better in his study than she had expected']

Why did most people return the phones?	"Worldwide, the most people willing to return your mobile phone if you've lost it are to be found in Slovenia, and the fewest in Malaysia. This finding is the result of an interesting study in 32 of the world's largest cities. Altogether, researchers ""lost"" 960 new mobile phones. They got back 654 of them, or 68 percent. Prague came in at number eight. There, 23 out of 30 people who were willing to return the mobile phone. It wasn't a traditional study. Two researchers carefully chose different places, such as areas with high crime and busy downtown shopping areas, to ""lose"" the phones. When one of the researchers dropped a phone, the other would keep watching from a distance. The honest finders tried their best to find the owner with the help of the address book in the phone. They were told why the study was done and asked why they acted the way they did. It was found that the busier the place where the researchers dropped the phone, the greater the chance of it being returned. Another interesting finding was that women were generally more likely than men to return the phone. Researchers also found that most people still have a sense of honesty. ""Crime is simply not good behaviour ,"" said an expert. ""People want to trust others, and want to be trusted."""	['They wanted to be trusted.']

We were looking for a waterfall .We didn't have much time to get to the waterfall and back, so we were running. We were wearing flip-flops to prevent our shoes getting dirty.

We followed red arrows and crossed that stream several times, walking on toward the promised waterfall. Time was not on our side, however, and we were forced to turn around. As we started back, we looked at the shallow stream we had just crossed. Where did this rushing river come from? That was when we realized a flash flood was around! In the few minutes the water rose at a fast speed. Now there were no big stones to be seen-only what looked like lumps covered with rushing water. We had no choice but to move our way back carefully in the rushing water -in flip-flops. We had crossed the stream not once or twice, but six times in search of a waterfall that we never even reached! With most of the crossings, we needed each other's help if we didn't want to be washed away by water. Wet all over, we felt relaxed after we made the last crossing. ""My dad always told me to keep off a river when travelling in the rain."" Josh said as we hurried back down the path. ""Why didn't you tell us that earlier?"" I laughed. ""Would it have made a difference?"" came the reply. He had a point."	['had much experience in travelling in the rain']
It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Last year, on report card day, my son and a group of his 13-year-old friends piled into the back seat of my car, ready for the last-day-of-school party at McDonald's. ""Jack got a laptop for getting straight A's, and Laurie got a cell-phone,"" one boy said. ""Oh, yeah, and Sarah got an iPod Nano, and she's only in third grade,"" said another. ""And how about Brian? He got $10 for each A."" I suddenly became concerned. These payoffs might get parents through grammar school, but what about high school and beyond? What would be left after the electric guitar, the cell-phone, and the DVD player? I saw the road ahead: _ I saw my comfortable lifestyle disappear before my eyes---no more of those $5 bags of already-peeled organic carrots. No more organic anything! I started to feel surprised and nervous. Would every goal achieved by my two children fetch a reward? A high grade point average? A good class ranking? Would sports achievements be included in this reward system: soccer goals, touchdowns ? What about the orchestra ? Would first chair pay more than second? I'd be penniless by eighth-grade graduation. ""We never paid anything for good grades,"" said my neighbor across the street, whose son was recently accepted at MIT. ""He just did it on his own. Maybe once in a while we went out for pizza, but that's about it."" Don't you just hate that? We're all running around looking for the MP3 player with the most updates, and she's spending a few dollars on pizza. She gets motivation; we get negotiation. And what about the primary grades? What do these students get? ""When the teacher asked if anyone got rewards for good grades, everyone in my class raised their hands and said they got ice cream cones ,"" said one third-grader."

Which title best gives the main idea of the passage?	We are often asked to make a speech in life. Most of us are afraid of it and don't do a good job. Here are some simple steps to make your speech a successful one. First of all, find out everything you can about your subject and at the same time find out as much as you can about your audience. Who are they? What do they know about your subject? Put yourself in their shoes as you prepare your speech. Then try to arrange your material so that your speech is clear and easy to follow. Use as many examples as possible. Never forget your audience. Don't talk over their heads or talk down to them. When you are giving your speech, speak slowly and clearly, look at your audience and for a few seconds from time to time to give your audience chances to think over what you've said. Just remember: be prepared, know your subject and your audience, say what you have to say and be yourself so that your ideas will bring you and your audience together.	['How to Improve Your Speech']
How many people are there in Laura's family?	"Laura Brent is a manager in an important company. She has three children--the eldest is 10, and youngest is three. ""My job was only possible because my husband David was prepared to take my place and become a house husband,"" she says. More and more couples are finding this arrangement suits them better in today's world, where women are rising to the top of their careers faster and more easily than they did in the past. Many men, on the other hand, like the idea of staying at home and looking after the children. ""My children see a lot more of me than I saw of my father when I was young, and I think it's better for them, especially for the boys,"" says David. ""It works just as well for Laura."" ""Now I can come home from a hard day at work, and immediately relax with the children, instead of having to do the housework and the cooking,"" she says. Is there anything David misses about going out to work? ""Not really. I suppose the worst thing about looking after children and doing the housework is not having a lunch break! It's a lot harder than most men think."""	['5']
Rose made herself known to the author in a _ manner.	"The first day our professor challenged us to get to know someone we didn't know. I looked around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady smiling at me. She said, ""Hi, handsome. My name is Rose. I'm 87. Can I give you a hug?"" I laughed, ""Of course you may!"" and she gave me a giant squeeze. ""Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?"" I asked. She jokingly replied, ""I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, and have a couple of children."" ""No seriously,"" I said. ""I want to realize my dream!"" she told me. Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and everyone liked to listen to this ""time machine"". At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football banquet and I'll never forget what she taught us. ""There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are 19 and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one productive thing, you will turn 20. If I am 87 and stay in bed for a year and never do anything I will turn 88. We have less time to live on. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability. The idea is to grow up by always finding opportunity in change. The elderly usually don't have regrets for what we did, but rather for things we did not do."" At the year's end, Rose finished the college degree she had dreamed about all those years. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep. Over 2,000 students attended her funeral honoring the wonderful woman who taught us such an important message."	['humorous']
Why does the author write the passage?	"Showering typically sends water down the drain, but a new space-age shower could change that. The design, inspired by NASA, saves water and money. Astronauts have no choice but to recycle the water they use in space. _ This futuristic shower comes from Orbital Systems, a Swedish advanced technology company. Its CEO, Mehrdad Mahdjoubi, invented the product. ""The shower of the future is a water-recycling shower, thus enabling water savings up to 90 percent, energy savings up to 80 percent, at the same time increasing comfort and hygiene. The water is being collected in the drain, it's being analyzed, purified and then pumped back up to the shower head. So what is so special about the purification technology? Well, it's based on a patented purification capsule system that makes sure that the water is always crystal clear,"" he explained. Mahdjoubi was inspired by a project between NASA and Sweden's Lund University to come up with designs for a mission to Mars. He adapted the closed-loop system that allows astronauts to re-use shower water again and again. The product already has been tested in Sweden, where it saved up to 100,000 liters of water over four months. Based on those results, Mahdjoubi is confident his company can distribute the shower system worldwide. ""Our market is anyone who takes a shower, actually, and the biggest benefit it gives is to the market segment where the water consumption is the highest, such as bathing establishments, gyms, sports centers. Also, private households where the water consumption and the prices are high,"" said Mahdjoubi. The ""out of this world"" design has won several business and innovation"	['To promote a new product']
This passage mainly tells us _ .	"To wash yourself, you take a bath or a shower. Animals need to keep clean, too. How do animals clean themselves? Cats themselves to keep their fur clean. Have you ever watched a pet cat clean itself? Elephants take baths much as you do. But instead of jumping into the , they walk into a river or lake. Pigs also like to roll around in water. This keeps them clean and cool. If there is no clean water, they will roll in on a hot day. They do this to cool off. Pigs do not really like mud. They are happier in a nice, clean pond . Bats have a funny way to keep clean. They lick their thumbs to clean their ears! Guess how polar bears clean themselves. They use snow, of course! Some animals take baths in dust instead of water! The wombat is an Australian animal with lots of fur. To get clean, it lies down. Then it covers itself with sand! Birds clean themselves in many ways. Sometimes they wash in water. That's why some people put birdbaths in their yard. At other times birds take dust baths, just like wombats. Birds also use their to keep their feathers clean. They use their beaks the way you use a comb. Sometimes a bird has in its feathers. Birds may use ants to help them clean off the bugs. A bird will lie down on an ant nest. Then the ants will crawl on the bird. The ants make a kind of bug on the feathers;. Then the itchy bugs die! Birds take baths in something else besides dust and ants! Some birds take ""smoke baths"" They sit on chimneys. They wave their wings in the smoke!"	['how some animals keep clean']
According to the passage, a student who is in a sleep debt _ .	"Let's face it -- you're going to get a lot of well-intentioned advice from friends, parents and grandparents about your sleep. Some of this advice is going to be just wrong. Myth 1: Sleeping late on the weekends will make up for lost sleep during the week. Fact: Getting less than the amount of sleep that you need night after night accumulates over time and starts to create a ""sleep debt"". And like all debts, eventually you need to pay the price. The problem with waiting until the weekend to meet sleep needs is that in the meantime, you are paying the price of being less alert, feeling more moody, thinking slower and having less stimulation. Myth 2: A boring teacher (or warm room, full stomach, etc.) can put teens to sleep. Fact: If you are getting enough sleep on a regular basis, there is no teacher, math book or reading assignment in the world boring enough to make you fall asleep in class. There are basically two things that make people sleepy -- not getting enough sleep and not getting good quality sleep. The environment kids are in, including the room temperature, light level and entertainment value, may unmask underlying sleepiness, but the environment does not cause it! So if you are dozing off in class, don't blame it on bad teaching. Myth 3: Teenagers can pull an all-nighter to study and still be ready for the big test in the morning. Fact: Teenagers are much better off studying less and getting a good night's sleep. Research clearly shows that the ability to concentrate and learn new information, as well as to work efficiently, declines sharply after being awake for 15-16 hours, and continues to bottom out the longer you stay up. Plus, if the big test is at 8:00 am, the problem gets even worse. That's because morning time typically represents a low energy point in the body's normal 24-hour circadian rhythm, especially in teenagers."	['will become bad-tempered and upset']
From the passage we can conclude that _ .	Eye Facts There are many commonly held beliefs about eyesight that are not proven facts. For example, some people believe that wearing glasses too soon weakens the eyes. But there is no evidence to show that the structure of eyes is changed by wearing glasses at young age. Wearing the wrong glasses, however, can prove harmful. Studies show that for adults there is no danger, but children can develop loss of sight if they have glasses unsuitable for their eyes. We have all heard some of the common myths about how eyesight gets bad. Most people believe that reading in weak light causes poor eyesight, but that is untrue. Too little light makes the eyes work harder, so they do get tired and strained. Eyestrain also results from reading a lot, reading in bed, and watching too much television. However, although eyestrain may cause some pain or headaches, it does not damage eyesight in the long term. Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced, or transplanted from one person to another. There are close to one million nerve fibers that connect the eyeball to the brain; as of yet, it is impossible to connect them all in a new person. Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced. But if we keep clearing up the myths and learning more about the eyes, someday a full transplant may be possible!	['doctors are still learning things about eyesight']
Why does the author mention the U.S. presidential election campaign?	"Are extraverts really better leaders? Can an introvert be a good leader? Research has shown a consistent positive relationship between extraversion and leadership. In groups of strangers,such as a jury , extraversion predicts who will be selected foreperson of the jury. It's actually likely to be the person who talks the most,and that person is probably an extravert. So, extraverts are more likely to be chosen for leadership positions (what we call leader ""emergence""). There is also a positive relationship (although a weaker one) between extraversion and leader effectiveness, particularly evaluated effectiveness of leaders. So it appears that extraverts have _ an _ edge, _ but does this mean that introverts can't be good leaders? Of course not ! Many successful leaders are introverted, for example Abraham Lincoln, Gandhi, and in business, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. One of the best company presidents that I've known was easily the most introverted person among his executive team, but he was very successful and his colleagues admired his ""quiet reserve and confidence"". So what is the critical factor that both extraverts and introverts need to emerge as a leader and to be effective? Our research has suggested that the key element is good interpersonal, or social, skills. In one study,we looked at the relationship of extraversion to leadership emergence and effectiveness and found that the advantage that extraverts had disappeared when we put social skills into the equation . In other words,only extraverts who possessed social skills were effective leaders. Good interpersonal skills are critical whether the leader is an extravert or an introvert. In addition,we know that we are more likely to choose leaders who look like their prototypes of leaders--they speak well, interact well with others, and just look ""leader-like"". Extraverts just naturally look more like a prototypical leader, particularly political leaders, than do introverts. Think of the U.S. presidential campaign where presidential hopefuls were evaluated for how much each looked like he or she could be the Commander-in-Chief. The key to leadership success then is to develop the people skills needed to look like a leader, but to also develop the good leader-follower relationships that are necessary for success. If you possess these skills,introversion and extraversion don't matter very much."	['To indicate the importance of developing people skills.']
Elena went to Greece in order to visit_.	"Christine and Elena grew up in the same suburb of Sydney and first met at kindergarten. They took to each other immediately and became inseparable friends throughout their school lives. Elena's parents had moved from Greece to Australia, and her grandparents still lived on the small Greek island of Santorini, When she was 16, Elena visited her grandparents for the first time. On returning to Australia, she talked endlessly about her grandmother's next-door neighbor, Mara. When Christine expressed puzzlement at Elena's obsession with people next door, Elena admitted that Maria had a handsome son called Nicos. She showed Christine a photo of him, standing next to his prize possession, a motorbike. Elena and Nicos exchanged emails for a while, but suddenly Nicos stopped writing. While not heartbroken, Elena was nevertheless hurt. A year later, when Christine announced that she was going to visit Greece, Elena begged her to visit Santorini and say hello to Maria and Nicos. Christine agreed to do so. When she flew into Athens on an unseasonably cold day in September, she quickly realized that she hadn't brought enough warm clothes. Walking through the streets of the Greek capital, she happened to see a nice coat in a shop window and went in to ask about the price. The coat was too expensive, but as Christine was about to leave the shop, the woman asked her where she was from. When Christine answered Australia, the woman agreed to reduce the price because she knew a nice girl from Australia called Elena. Christine then noticed a photo of a young man standing next to a motorbike. Her eyes opened wide with astonishment. It was Nicos! Indeed the young man was Nicos, and the woman in the shop was Maria. She had come to Athens from Santorini to look after the shop for a friend. Sadly, the story has a tragic ending. Nicos had been killed in a motorcycle accident. ""I wanted to tell Elena,"" said Maria. ""But I didn't know how. Now that I have met you, I know that it's time to tell her."""	['her grandparents']
Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage?	"Hiring a self-drive car really adds to the enjoyment of your holiday. There are so many interesting places to visit, and if you enjoy seeing more than just the city center, there's no better way to explore than by car. HIRE CHARGES: What's included (a)Unlimited mileage. (b)Expenses on oil, maintenance and repairs, which will be repaid on production of receipts. (c)Full insurance cover but exclusive of personal accident(see below)and contents. What's not included (a)Personal accident insurance. (b)Garaging, petrol, parking One bitterly cold day, a snowstorm blew into our area. Needing firewood, quickly set out with my best friend, Bruce, to look for a tree to cut down. I was glad to have Bruce along. Cutting down a tree in a snowstorm can be dangerous. So it was important to have a friend who could warn me of dangers. When I chose a big 23-meter-tall tree and prepared to cut it down, my best friend suddenly warned me,""Don't cut down that tree! It's too close to the power line!""I wasn't sure about it. So I becided to _ his warning. I wanted to finish the job quickly and go home. So I began cutting down the tree. When the tree fell, there was no longer any doubt whether my friend was right. The tree caught the power line, bringing it to the ground. I considered cutting the tree off the line. After all, electricity can't travel through wood, so I could safely remove the tree. As I reached out my finger to touch the tree, pain ran up my arm and through my head. I had been shocked! After I returned home and told my mother what happened, she quickly called the power company. Workers from the power company soon arrived on the scene. One of them asked if I had touched the tree, and when I told him I had, his face turned pale. ""You should have been killed,""he said. So why am I still alive? It was my boots that saved my life. Within two hours, the workers removed the tree. Soon _ --but not my mother. Even though she was glad I wasn't hurt, my mother was still serious with me. After all, I shouldn't have brushed off my friend's warning. Through this experience, I learned it's important to listen to people who offer a different perspective. Taking the time to listen might actually save a lot of time and trouble. It certainly would have kept me from getting the""shock of my life."""	['The writer knew nothing about electricity.']
When he first met the author,David _ .	"(2013*,C)One day,when I was working as a psychologist in England,an adolescent boy showed up in my office.It was David.He kept walking up and down restlessly,his face pale,and his hands shaking slightly.His head teacher had referred him to me.""This boy has lost his family,""he wrote.""He is understandably very sad and refuses to talk to others,and I'm very worried about him.Can you help?"" I looked at David and showed him to a chair.How could I help him? There are problems psychology doesn't have the answer to,and which no words can describe.Sometimes the best thing one can do is to listen openly and sympathetically. The first two times we met,David didn't say a word.He sat there,only looking up to look at the children's drawings on the wall behind me.I suggested we play a game of chess.He nodded.After that he played chess with me every Wednesday afternoon--in complete silence and without looking at me.It's not easy to cheat in chess,but I admit I made sure David won once or twice. Usually,he arrived earlier than agreed,took the chess board and pieces from the shelf and began setting them up before I even got a chance to sit down.It seemed as if he enjoyed my company.But why did he never look at me? ""Perhaps he simply needs someone to share his pain with,""I thought.""Perhaps he senses that I respect his suffering.""Some months later,when we were playing chess,he looked up at me suddenly. ""It's your turn,""he said. After that day,David started talking.He got friends in school and joined a bicycle club.He wrote to me a few times,about his biking with some friends,and about his plan to get into university.Now he had really started to live his own life. Maybe I gave David something.But I also learned that one--without any words--can reach out to another person.All it takes is a hug,a shoulder to cry on,a friendly touch,and an ear that listens."

From the passage, we can infer that .	"In my mind, there is a moving story about a skinny young boy who loved football with all his heart. Practice after practice, he eagerly gave everything he had. But being half the size of the other boys,he got ly nowhere. Despite his hard training at all the games, this hopeful athlete sat on the bench and hardly ever played. This teenager lived alone with his father, and the relationship between the two of them was very special. Even though the son was always on the bench, his father was always in the stands cheering. He never missed a game. This young man was still the smallest of the class when he entered high school. But his father continued to encourage him. The young man loved football and was determined to try his best at every practice, and perhaps he'd get to play when he became a senior. All through high school he never missed a practice nor a game but remained a benchwarmer. Besides, his faithful father was always in the stands, always with words of encouragement for him. When the young man went to college, he decided to try out for the football team as a""walk-on"". Everyone firmly believed that he could never make the cut, but he did. The news that he had survived the cut thrilled him so much that he rushed to the nearest phone and called his father. His father shared his excitement and was sent season tickets for all the college games. This persistent young athlete never missed practice during his four years at college, butactually he never got the real chance to play in a game. It was at the end of his senior football season that the coach met him with a telegram. The young man read the telegram and he became totally silent. Swallowing hard, he mumbled to the coach,""My father died this morning. Is it all right if I miss practice today?""The coach put his arm gently around his shoulder and said,""Take the rest of the week off, son. And don't even plan to come back to the game on Saturday."" Saturday arrived, and the game was not going well. In the third quarter, when the team was ten points behind, a silent young man quietly slipped into the empty locker room and put on his football gear. As he ran onto the sidelines , the coach and his players were surprised to see their faithful teammate back so soon.""Coach, please let me play. I've just got to play today,""said the young man. The coach pretended not to hear him. There was no way he wanted his worst player in this close play-off game. But the young man insisted, and finally feeling sorry for the kid, the coach gave in.""All right,""he said.""You can go in.""Before long, the coach, the players and everyone in the stands could not believe their eyes. This little unknown, who had never played before, was doing everything right. The opposing team could not stop him. He ran, passed, blocked, and tackled like a star. His team began to succeed. The score was soon tied. In the closing seconds of the game, this kid got a pass and ran all the way for the winning touchdown. Finally, after the stands had emptied, the coach noticed that this young man was sitting quietly in the corner all alone. The coach came to him and said,""Kid, you were unbelievably fantastic! Tell me what got into you? How did you do it?"" He looked at the coach, tears in his eyes, and said,""Well, you knew my dad died, but did you know that my dad was blind?""The young man swallowed hard and forced a smile,""Dad came to all my games, but today was the first time he could see me play, and I wanted to show him I could make it!"""

Why did William Faulkner write about the southern states of America?	"The centenary of the birth of William Faulkner, one of the great modern novelists, was celebrated in September 1997. Faulkner wrote about the southern states of the United States of America where he grew up, and where his family had an important part to play in the history of that region. His work became a touchstone for insights into the troubled issues of southern American identity, race relations, and the family interrelationships of the old time southern gentry . Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi on September 25, 1897. Despite his interest in writing, he left Oxford High School, Mississippi, without graduating. After World War I, he entered the University of Mississippi as a special student, a right to study which was granted to retired soldiers, although Faulkner had only finished training with the Air Force in Canada, and not entered combat . Faulkner began to write poems, a verse play, short stories and finished his first novel Sartoris in 1928. His fiction was centered for 14 of the 19 novels published during his lifetime in a fictional region called Yoknapatawpha County. The name is said to come from the Indian Chickasaw word meaning split land. In December 1950, Faulkner was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. When he accepted it in Stockholm, his speech emphasized that he wished to continue writing, but in a positive way that affirmed the power of humanity to prevail over adverse circumstances. As he said in his speech, he still felt that, despite the threat of nuclear war then hanging over the world, the central concern of the writer should be ""the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself"". He wanted the tensions and problems that he had cast the spotlight on in the southern states of America to be resolved by the life-affirming attitudes and action of his characters. Like playwright Tennessee Williams, Faulkner was a major voice who spoke for the troubled heart of the southern states of America. His achievement is all the more remarkable because, as a schoolboy, he was not only a frequent absentee but also reportedly failed to reach pass grades in English class. His collected short stories, novels, poems, and other writings form a legacy( ) of literature which casts profound illumination on the special culture of the South, a culture which developed from a history and social circumstances that were always unique. From the focus on a fictional county, and by remaining true to his view of a close-knit but real society that reflected the greater world around him, Faulkner in the end fashioned a legend of the Deep South that is one of the major achievements of the 20th century literature."

Why did the writer go to Hawaii?	When I was eight, I saw a movie about an island that had an erupting volcano and jungles filled with wild animals. The island was ruled by a beautiful woman called Tondalaya, the Fire Goddess of the Volcano. It was a low-budget movie, but to me, it represented the perfect life. But through the years, Tondalaya was forgotten. The week I turned 50, my marriage came to a sudden end. My house, furniture and everything I'd owned was sold to pay debts that I didn't even know existed. In a week I had lost my husband, my home and my parents who had refused to accept a divorce in the family. I'd lost everything except my four teenage children. I used every penny I had to buy five plane tickets from Missouri to Hawaii. Everyone said I was crazy to think I could just run off to an island and survive. I was afraid they were right. I worked 18 hours a day and lost 30 pounds because I lived on one meal a day. One night as I walked alone on the beach, I saw the red orange lava pouring out of Kilauea Volcano in the distance. It was time to live my imagination! The next day, I quit my job, bought some art supplies and began doing what I loved. I hadn't painted a picture in 15 years. I wondered if I could still paint. My hands trembled the first time I picked up a brush. But before an hour had passed, I was lost in the colors spreading across the canvas in front of me. And as soon as I started believing in myself, other people started believing in me, too. The first painting sold for $1,500. The past six years have been filled with adventures. My children and I have gone swimming with dolphins, watched whales and hiked around the crater rim of the volcano. We wake up every morning with the ocean in front of us and the volcano behind us. The dream I had more than 40 years is now reality. I'm living freely and happily ever after.	['To make a living.']
The best title for this passage is _ .	Hoorah!I have escaped the Czech Republic! I am now wearing light clothing and sunglasses, although the _ today,as it is cool and overcast with cloud and it has rained slightly. The city of Qatar is flat and sandy with few trees -- mostly palms. You can see construction everywhere, new streets with hotels and apartment blocks in prefix = st1 /Venicetheme. It's a mix of super modern and traditional building styles. Everything looks new including the vehicles. There are many huge roundabouts; no traffic rules or at least no one obeys any. The huge 4-storey shopping mall in fantastic style has an ice rink on the ground floor. Thousands of people walk round the waterfront after dark. Qataris are very religious and there are calls to prayers regularly. Qatari men are dressed in all sorts of traditional clothing plus western dresses. You can easily find imported labour from South Asian countries, poorly paid and discriminated against. I am told that Qataris don't hide their racist attitudes. Women are always wonderful sights. Some are in all sorts of black clothing with face uncovered; some totally enveloped; lots wearing western dresses. Best sight so far: a woman in a mall completely wrapped in black including gloves, not even an eye shown -- wearing glasses on the outside of her veil , using a cell phone while fingering a dress. I am living with my employers -- a New Zealandcouple, and another teacher namedWayne, all about my age. We share one apartment. I have a large room with a bathroom attached: it is a little run-down but very comfortable. The only rather annoying thing is that I have to use the laptop on my bed as there is no desk and chair in here. As soon as it is clear that I will be staying I will make a change to all this. I haven't lived with other people for many years and have been used to living alone so it will be interesting to see how this works.	['My First Impressions ofQatar']

Then Mayer slowly got her cow more adapted to human contact and riding equipment. About six months later, it was time to see how Luna would respond to a rider on her back in a competition for horses. Mayer sat in the saddle ,and all went as planned. ""She was really well behaved and walked normally, but after a couple of meters, she wanted to get me off her back!

A coral island looks like _ .	In the sea there are many islands. In its warm waters there are some little ones. We call them coral islands. A coral island is very nice to look at. It looks like a ring of land with trees, grass, and flowers on it. One part of the ring is open to the water. There is a little round lake inside the island. If you look into this lake, you will see beautiful coral. You may think they are flowers. If you look at a piece of coral, you will see many little holes in it. In each of these holes a very small sea animal has lived. These sea animals make the coral. They began to build under the water. Year after year, the coral grew higher and higher. At last it grew out of the water. Then the sea brought to it small trees and something else. After some years, these things changed into earth. Sometimes the wind brought seeds to this earth. Sometimes birds flew over it and brought seeds to the island. The little seeds grew. In a few years there were plants all over the island. In a few more years there were trees growing there. So you see, these islands were built little by little. The workers were very small. Don't they teach us a lesson? Can you think what the lesson is?	['a ring of land']

The world is thirsty for water because _ .	The world is not only hungry but also thirsty for water. This may seem strange to you, since nearly 70% of the earth's surface is covered with water. But about 97% of that is sea water or salt water. Man can only drink and use the other 3% of fresh water from rivers, lakes, underground and so on. And we can not even use all of that because some of it has been made dirty. Earth Day is April 22. But on all other days, we must also remember how important water is. The water that we use is the most important natural resource on the earth. Today we face serious water problems. One of them is water pollution. All kinds of things from cars, factories, farms and homes make our rivers, lakes and oceans dirty. Polluted water is very bad for people to drink. And dirty water is bad for fish, too. How do cars and factories make our water dirty? First they pollute the air. Then when it rains, the rain water makes our drinking water dirty. Dirty rain, called acid rain is also bad for plants, animals and buildings. Scientists say that in 30 years, more than half of the people in the world won't have enough clean water. We have to learn how to stop wasting water. One of the first steps is to develop ways of reusing it. Today in most large cities, water is used only once and then sent out into a sewer system . From there it returns to the sea or goes underground. But even though every large city reused its water, we would still not have enough. So we should make use of sea water by removing the salt in it. If we can take these steps, fresh water won't be used up.	"[""we don't have enough fresh water""]"
Which of the following statements is NOT mentioned by the author?	"Rich or poor, we all have problems: that unfaithful mate, that irritating colleague, that persistent disease, the investment that is turning into a huge loss. How do we remain calm, positive and even elegant in the face of all these difficulties of life? That following suggestions may help. It comes with the pay. I have a friend who used to complain about her dead-end job and unreasonable boss. Sound familiar? One day I told her, ""Look at it this way. You are getting paid for the annoyance as well as the work. It comes with the pay."" This has become my favorite saying for work-related frustrations. ""Take every day as a bonus."" When we learn to treasure every moment of what we have, we begin to see life in a whole new perspective. It's all in the mind. Sure, the psychologists tell us it is important we work at resolving problems. But they also say if you try to resolve a problem that would not go away, it would only compound the frustration. If you tell yourself there isn't a problem, there won't be one. It's all in the mind. Stop thinking about your own problem ---help others instead. A lady who is combating a life-threatening disease revealed she coped with her illness by making herself useful, by offering help to others in a similar situation. She has spoken to at least five other women with breast cancer. She says that the sharing has helped her to find fresh meaning in her own life. Never give up on your dream. Why do we give in and give up when meet difficulties? Is it because we have no confidence in our cause and no commitment for what we pursue? It was said that Albert Einstein's last request on his death bed was to be given his equations and his unfinished statement declining the presidency of prefix = st1 /Israel. Einstein first picked up his equations and lamented to his son, ""If only I had more mathematics!"" What a great persistent spirit! One strong-hearted lady was the late head of the tragic Kennedy family, Rose Kennedy.

Josh Goodman decided to invent the self-service beer taps when _ .	"How much do you hate waiting for another beer in a crowded bar? Josh Goodman invented a pretty obvious solution --self-service beer taps. Goodman, 36, recalled the exact moment in late 2008 when his frustration _ ""I was hanging out with my friends at a Baltimore sports bar before an Orioles game,"" he said. ""We just couldn't get another beer served to us quickly."" Even more than annoyed, Goodman was struck by how much money the bar must be losing. Almost immediately, he got to work on a self-service beer concept. Within a few months, Goodman had launched Pour My Beer in Chicago (where he'd relocated to be with his wife). He invested $20,000 of his own funds and partnered with a U.S. manufacturer to make beer tables with two to four self-service taps. In February 2009, Goodman landed his first client : A Baltimore tavern. He spent the next two years growing the business and adding more bars and restaurants. In 2011, Pour My Beer introduced self-service ""beer walls,"" which let people pour their own beer from taps on a wall. Pour My Beer has expanded to over 200 restaurants and bars in 28 states and Canada. The concept will roll out in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport this week and in Italy and Brazil later this year. The tables start at $4,000 and the beer walls cost as much as $16,000. It generated more than $400,000 in sales in 2013 and doubled that in 2014. Goodman expects to take in close to $2 million in revenue this year(2015) --which would make it the company's first profitable year. ""Our business customers tell us that they've cut down on waste and they're selling twice as much beer on average,"" said Goodman."	['He realized the loss in waiting for beers.']
The best title of the passage might be _ .	"To switch or not to switch, that is the question.Google's announcement of its Nexus One smartphone happened over a week ago and I'm still receiving lots of e-mails from readers asking the same question: Should they give up their iPhone for the Nexus One? Some people with iPhones, disappointed by American Telephone&Telegraph's inadequate service and the high monthly cost, are wondering if they have really got something to replace it.Does the Nexus One offer the functions that Apple has led them to expect? I'm on the fence myself, even though I never thought I'd be interested in anything but the iPhone.From my experience using the Nexus One, and from talking to people who have made the change, it's not necessarily about the differences between the iPhone and the Nexus One.The phones are extremely similar in design and general feel.Instead, the decision can be made based on the software services you use on your desktop. My friend Chad Dickerson received a pre-launch Nexus One from Google three weeks ago.He said Google's phone feels connected to certain services on the Web in a way the iPhone doesn't.""Compared to the iPhone, the Google phone feels like it's part of the Internet to me,"" he said.""If you live in a Google world, you have that world in your pocket in a way that's cleaner and more connected than the iPhone.""

Why will America joining in the ISS be tied to the result of the examination?	The ISS project is a partnership of five - the US, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada. At the moment, no program for its use nor any money has been put in place to support the platform beyond 2015. One of the biggest issues stopping an agreement on station-life extension is the human spaceflight examination ordered by US President Barack Obama. The Americans are developing a new vision for space exploration, and the rockets and spacecraft they will need to start it. The future of US joining in the ISS is closely tied to the result of the examination. Mr Dordain, the European Space Agency's (Esa) Director General, said no one partner in the ISS project could alone call an end to the platform. A meeting would be held in Japan later in the year where he hoped the partners could get something clearly going forward. He said it was also necessary the benefits were increased and the costs were reduced. Increasing the benefits could include finding new uses for the station. Esa has called for ideas on how to use the ISS as a platform for Earth observation . Mr Dordain said the agency had received about 20 very good proposals. On the issue of reducing costs, there were many ideas on the table, he explained. He also questioned whether it was necessary for the station to have six astronauts at all times. If there were periods when little maintenance was required or the experiment load was light, could the ISS run on a smaller group of people, he suggested. Construction of the space station should finish this year. Next month, two _ s built in Europe - a connecting node and a robotic control room - will be flown to the platform by the US shuttle Endeavour. Tranquility and the Cupola, as they are known, will complete the non-Russian side of the ISS.	"[""Because they need America's rockets and spacecraft""]"
For what purpose is the Screenfridge made?	"When Rikke Dausen in prefix = st1 /Denmarkgoes to get some milk from the fridge, she has trouble getting past the refrigerator door. But it's not because of any physical obstruction. It's usually because the PC monitor in her refrigerator's door has informed her that a new email message has arrived. Rikke and her husband are taking part in a six-month trial sponsored by a Danish firm and two Swedish partners. They hope to show that computers can be put to much more practical daily use than most people think. Fifty families and singles were provided with a free model known as the ""Screenfridge"" for the duration of trial. ""It's really very clever"", says Rikke. She can call up email, news reports, sales items at the supermarket or addressed out of the endless ocean Internet possibilities. ""I'm not the type who wants to sit in front of the computer and wait 10 minutes for the modem to connect,"" she says. The creators of the Screenfridge aim at this type of buyer. They think the machine should attract people who have limited time to solve technical problems or surf online. The PC that is built into the door is very small. It is only two centimeters wide, and completely silent. ""Everything moves quickly"", as Rikke admits. ""Well, the whole thing is really just an amusement"", she says.

What can be the best title for the text?	In all the world's cultures, people sing, play instruments, and celebrate with music. It plays such an important role in our lives that all fields focus on its study, including one looking at the biology of music. Experts are finding that because of the way our brains process music, learning to play an instrument or just listening to music can have a wide range of benefits. Music education has received a lot of attention. Learning to play an instrument can help children improve math, science, and language skills. One study in Canada tracked children's IQ scores for nine months, discovering that children who studied music had the biggest test score improvements. The secret may lie in the way reading music and playing notes uses several areas of the brain, increasing our ability to learn school subjects. For example, reading notes improves spatial reasoning skills, which are helpful in solving math problems like fractions . Music is also used for medical purposes, such as the treatment of diseases which affect memory. The secret lies in the way the brain processes music. One area near the forehead, the medial prefrontal cortex, connects music with memories stored in two other areas: the amygdale and hippocampus. That's why an old song can remind you of something that happened years ago. For patients suffering from diseases like Alzheimer's, listening to music can help unlock buried memories by strengthening musical pathways to memories. With the evidence of music's benefits pouring in, it's no wonder some countries make music study a part of their education systems. People are recognizing that more than just a form of entertainment, music is also great for the brain.	['Music and the mind']
As is known in the passage, _ .	"Sheep Smarter than Thought London--Sheep, like turkeys and ostriches, are not considered the most clever animals. British scientists said last Wednesday humans may have underestimated the woolly creature. They could be much smarter than we think. Researchers at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, southern England, have shown that the animals have a good memory system and are extremely good at recognizing faces--which they think is a sure sign of intelligence. Behavioral scientist Keith Kendrick and his friends trained 20 sheep to recognize and distinguish 25 pairs of sheep faces and used electrodes to measure their brain activity , which showed they could remember 50 faces for up to two years . ""If they can do that with faces, they have to have reasonable intelligence; otherwise, what is the point of having a system for remembering faces and not remembering anything else?"" Kendrick said in an interview. So hours of seemingly mindless eating grass may not be so mindless after all. Kendrick believes sheep got their reputation as dumb (unable to speak, unintelligent) animals because they live in large groups and do not appear to have much individuality and are frightened of just about everything. ""All animals, including humans, once they are frightened, don't tend to show signs of intelligent action,"" he explained. In research reported in the science journal Nature, Kendrick and his team showed that sheep, like humans, have a specialized system in the brain which allows them to distinguish between many different faces which look extremely similar. ""The most important finding (of the study) is that they are able , both from a behavioral point of view and from looking at the way the brain is organized , to remember a large number of individuals for a very long time,"" said Kendrick. ""It is a very strange system. They are showing similar abilities in many ways to humans."""	['when sheep eat grass in the field their minds may be active']
From the passage, we can infer the person who is _ is the most popular kind of person.	Down-to-earth means being honest, open, and easy to deal with. It is a pleasure to find someone who is down-to-earth. A person who is down-to-earth is easy to talk to. He or she accepts others as equals. A down-to-earth person may be an important member of society, of course, but they do not let their importance go to their heads, and they do not consider themselves to be better than others who are less important. Someone who is filled with self-importance and pride, often without cause, is said to have his nose in the air. There is no way a person with his nose in the air can be down-to-earth. Americans use another expression that is similar in some way to down-to-earth. The expression is both feet on the ground. Someone with both feet on the ground is a person with a good understanding of reality. He has what is called common sense. He may have dreams but he does not allow them to block his knowledge of what is real. The opposite kind of person is one who has his head in the clouds. A man with his head in the clouds is a dreamer whose mind is not in the world. Sometimes such a dreamer can be brought back to reality; sharp words from the teacher, for example, can usually get a daydreaming student to put both feet back on the ground. The person who is down-to-earth usually has both feet on the ground. _ . Someone with both feet on the ground may not be as open and easy to deal with as someone who is down-to-earth. When we have both our feet firmly on the ground, we are realistic and we act honestly and openly toward others, and our lives are like the ground below us, solid and strong.	['down-to-earth']
Which of the following can not help people get more Vitamin D?	"Cancer researchers urged people on Wednesday to take more vitamin D to lower risk of cancer, saying studies showed a clear link. ""Our suggestion is for people to increase their intake, through diet or a vitamin supplement,"" Dr. Cedric Garland said in a telephone interview. Garland's research team reviewed 63 studies, including several large long-term ones, on the relationship between vitamin D and certain types of cancer worldwide between 1966 and 2004. ""There's nothing that has this ability to prevent cancer,"" he said, urging governments and public health officials to do more to fortify foods with vitamin D.Garland is part of a University of California at San Diego Moores Cancer Center team that published its findings this week online in the American Journal of Public Health. Vitamin D is found in milk, as well as in some fortified orange juice, yogurt and cheeses, usually at around 100 international units (IU) a serving. People might want to consider a vitamin supplement to raise their intake to 1000 IUs per day, Garland said, adding that it was well within the safety guidelines established by the National Academy of Sciences. The authors said that taking more vitamin D could be especially important for people living in northern areas, which receive less vitamin D from sunshine. African Americans, who don't produce as much of the vitamin because of their skin colour, could also benefit significantly from a higher intake, the authors said."	['Have more meat']

What did Mr Lazares do when his students were not behaving well in class?	"In the United States, headmasters and teachers discipline students in several ways. The teacher often writes to or calls the students' parents. Sometimes students have to stay at school for one hour. If a student behaves very badly, the headmaster can stop the student having classes. The student can't come to school for one, two or three days. Mr Lazares, the headmaster of a middle school in Ohio, did not like to do so. When he didn't let the students come to school, they were happy. ""A three-day holiday!"" they thought. One day, a boy was in Mr Lazares's office. The boy was not behaving well in class. Mr Lazares telephoned the boy's parents. ""If you come to school with your son, I won't stop him having classes."" He said. The boy's father came to school and went with his son to every class. Other students looked at the boy and his father. The boy was embarrassed . After that he behaved better. And, of course, other students behaved better, too. Now headmasters all over the USA are trying Mr Lazares's idea. They, too, think that students behave better when parents come to school."

If you are the best tomato gardener you will _ .	Sonoma County, California is famous for its natural beauty. The area is also known for its fruits, vegetables, eggs, and seafood. When I first moved to the area years ago, I had no idea I would be living in such a rich area! After the summer, local festivals practically celebrate the richness of the county every weekend. From Egg Days, Tomato Festival to Seafood Festival, Sonoma County has something for everyone. An event held every year is one of the most special in the area, which celebrates the harvest of tomatoes, showing over 170 kinds of this tasty fruit. Cooks prepare the most favorite tomato-inspired dishes. You can enjoy all kinds of food while listening to live music, and taste the world famous Kendall Jackson wine. Another great feature of this event is the opportunity to take part in the yearly competition with your own tomatoes. Tomatoes are judged on looks, taste, and weight and winners will be awarded . If you're planning on visiting and want to attend this event, get your ticket early as it sells out quickly. This year, to celebrate Tomato Festival, I decided to plant a few tomatoes in a wine barrel that had kept a lemon tree before. The tree, after about 6 years, finally did not produce fruits anymore, so I changed to plant 3 tomato plants instead. The three wine barrel plants stand over six feet tall and that's above the top of the barrel! They have lots of flowers and some have started to produce fruits. As usual, harvest may be late this year, but the quality of my tomatoes will be excellent. I believe I'll realize my dream of being the best tomato gardener.	['be given prizes as a winner']

According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true?	"People have strange ideas about food. For example, the tomato is a kind of very delicious vegetable. It is one of useful plants that can be prepared in many ways. It has rich nutrition and vitamin in it. But in the 18thcentury, Americans never ate tomatoes. They grew them in their gardens because tomato plants are so pretty. But they thought the vegetable was poisonous . They called tomatoes ""poison apples."" President Thomas Jefferson, however, knew that tomatoes were good to eat. He was a learned man. He had been to Paris, where he learned to love the taste of tomatoes. He grew many kinds of tomatoes in his garden. The President taught his cook a way for a cream of tomato soup. This beautiful pink soup was served at the President's party. The guests thought the soup tasted really good. They never thought their president would serve his honored guests poison apples. Jefferson never spoke to his honored guests about the fact."

Ants judge whether another one is dead or not depending on _ .	"When an ant dies, other ants move the dead insect out. Sometimes, the dead ant get moved away very soon--within an hour of dying. This behavior is interesting to scientists, who wonder how ants know for sure--and so soon--that another ant is dead. One scientist recently came up with a way to explain this ant behavior. Dong-Hwan Choe is a biologist. Choe found that Argentine ants have a chemical on the outside of their bodies that signals to other ants, ""I'm dead--take me away."" But there's a _ to Choe's discovery. Choe says that the living ants--not just the dead ones--have this death chemical. In other words, while an ant crawls around, perhaps in a picnic or home, it's telling other ants that it's dead. What keeps ants from dragging away the living ants?Choe found that Argentine ants have two additional chemicals on their bodies, and these tell nearby ants something like, ""Wait--I'm not dead yet."" So Choe's research turned up two sets of chemical signals in ants: one says, ""I'm dead,"" and the other set says, ""I'm not dead yet."" Other scientists have tried to figure out how ants know when another ant is dead. If an ant is knocked unconscious, for example, other ants leave it alone until it wakes up. That means ants know that unmoving ants can still be alive. Choe suspects that when an Argentine ant dies, the chemical that says ""Wait-I'm not dead yet"" quickly goes away. Once that chemical is gone, only the one that says ""I'm dead"" is left. ""It's because the dead ant no longer smells like a living ant that it gets carried to the graveyard, not because its body releases new unique chemicals after death,"" said Choe. When other ants detect the ""dead"" chemical without the ""not dead yet"" chemical, they drag away the body. Understanding this behavior may help scientists figure out how to stop Argentine ants from invading new places and causing problems. Choe would like to find a way to use the newly discovered chemicals to spread ant killer to Argentine ant nests. The ants' removal behavior is important to the overall health of the nest. ""Being able to quickly remove dead individuals and other possible sources of disease is extremely important to all animals living in societies, including us,"" says Choe. ""Think about all the effort and money that we invest daily in waste management."""	['the sense of smell']
It seemed that the dolphins slapped the water with their tails to _ .	"A group of swimmers has described how a group of dolphins protected them from a group of white sharks off the coast of New Zealand. The lifeguards were on a training swim when they came across a group of great white sharks before the dolphins raced in to help. The swimmers were surrounded by the dolphins for forty minutes before they were able to make them safety back to the beach. It was an uncomfortable experience as they were circled by a group of white sharks, which came within a couple of meters of them. Lifeguard Rob Howes was in the water with a colleague and his teenage daughter. He said around half a dozen dolphins suddenly appeared and forced them to gather together. The mammals swam in tight circles to create a protective wall between the white sharks and the lifeguards as the great white sharks were under the surface. The swimmers said the dolphins were extremely upset and repeatedly slapped the water with their tails as if to try to prevent the white sharks from attacking them. It's a day they'll never forget, especially for one who was on her first day as _ They have no doubt that the dolphins acted on purpose to protect them.

The dissolving of salt in water is _ .	There are two kinds of changeschemical change and physical change. In a chemical change, there is always a new substance formed. Breaking up water into hydrogen and oxygen is a chemical change. In each of the chemical change at least one new substance is formed. A change is not a chemical change if it doesn't form a new substance. Physical changes are very common, too. There are many examples. You can make a physical change by tearing a piece of paper into two, or by cutting a piece of iron with lathe . Here paper is still paper, and the iron is still iron. Another way of making physical change is dissolving something in water. When you dissolve salt in water, the salt disappears. You may think that a new substance has been formed. But really there is no new substance. The salt is still salt. You can still taste it. So the dissolving of anything is a physical change. When water freezes, the change is also a physical one. The water changes from liquid to solid, but it is still the same substance. That is why the freezing of anything is a physical change.	['a physical change']
We can infer from the passage that _ .	Imagine living locked inside a closet. You can't choose when and what to eat or how you will spend your time. You can't even decide when the lights go on and off. Think about spending your whole life like this. This is the life of lab animals. Now consider the needs of these animals. Chimpanzees ,in their natural homes, are never separated from their families. They spend hours together every day. But in a lab, chimpanzees are put in cages alone. There are no families, only cold, hard cages, and loneliness that goes on for so many years that most of them lose their minds at last. Worse yet are the experiments. Animals are given diseases they would never normally get. Experimenters force-feed(......) chemicals to them, conduct repeated surgeries ,and much more, Think of what it would be like to put up with these and then be thrown back into a cage, usually without any painkillers. Often animals see other animals being killed right in front of them. Hundreds of thousands of animals are poisoned, blinded, and killed every year in product tests for shampoos, skin creams and new cancer drugs. Although more than 500 companies have stopped testing on animals, some of them still force chemicals into monkeys' stomachs and rabbits' eyes. Although some facilities are better than others at caring for animals--not every lab worker kills a mouse by cutting off its head with scissors--there are no happy animals inside laboratories. Will the lab life end? When will it end?	['some companies have found ways to replace animal tests']

There is still much he does not understand about America. Once, Minh was in a supermarket. He saw an old man and an old woman. They wanted a box of cereal .The box was on a high shelf. The man and the woman couldn't reach it. Minh saw a stepladder. He got on the ladder and got the box. He handed it to the elderly couple. They thanked him. ""Where are your children?"" asked Minh. ""Why don't they help you buy food?"" ""Our children have their own lives,"" said the man and the woman. ""We like to be independent."" Minh doesn't think this is right. In his country, children help their parents. Minh gave the elderly couple his phone number. He told them to call him if they needed help. One night they asked Minh to dinner, but they never asked him for help. One day, Minh was walking with a Vietnamese friend. The two men were going to a movie. Minh wanted to go to a restaurant first. Minh took his friend's hand. He pulled him towards the restaurant. People on the street stared at Minh. In Vietnam, friends often hold hands. Minh found that the people in America are not used to men holding hands. Minh Pham is going through a process known as _ . Socialization is the process in which a person learns to live in a society.

A bat mom _ .	Animal moms are great moms. You might be surprised at some of these moms. Octopuses The mother octopus lays about 50,000 eggs. For about 300 days, she stays with the eggs, cleans them and protects them. She does not leave to feed. However, this animal mom dies as soon as the eggs are hatched . Crocodiles A crocodile mother puts a lot of time and effort into raising her babies. She starts by building a nest , which she guards for over two months! When the eggs are ready to hatch, the young crocs call out to their mother, who digs them out and helps them hatch. She then carries them in her mouth down to the water, where she will guard them for several more weeks or months until they learn to hunt on their own. Bats Bats become moms by hanging head up in a cave, giving birth. Catching the youngster before it can fall to the ground below, she puts it in a pouch . Bat moms may carry babies with them when feeding for the first few days. As the little bats get bigger and heavier, moms help them hang on the wall of their caves and return often to feed them. It continues for about three weeks, until the babies are grown up and able to fly on their own. Koalas The animal mom gives birth after a pregnancy of only 35 days. The hairless baby climbs into its mother's pouch and lives there for another five months. When the little koala is between five and eight months old, it leaves the pouch for short periods of time but returns for safety. Once it is too big to return to the pouch, it will climb onto its mother's back and ride there until it is about 12 months old.	['gives birth by hanging in a cave']
Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg didn't finish college because _ .	"What can we learn from the special, very successful people in the world who make the impossible possible? Lesson 1: Ways of creative thinking are needed Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg both dropped out of college. They prefer to teach themselves because they like to develop their own ways of thinking. They think standard ways of teaching might stop people from being creative and having new ideas. Lesson 2: The answer might not be what you expect Find your answers from facts -- not start with an expectation of what you will find. Stephen Jacobsen from Northwestern University believed what he was taught: that water on Earth came from icy comets or planets which hit into Earth. However, by studying a special rock, he discovered that it acts like a sponge . This suggests that Earth's water may have come from inside, driven to the surface to form the oceans, by geological activity. ""I had a pretty hard time making others believe it,"" he said. ""But thinking about the fact that you may the first person to see something for the first time doesn't happen very often. When it does, it's amazing."" _ Years of planning went into a recent achievement in space travel. The European Space Agency's ""Philae"", a robot landing craft, met up with Comet 67P, which is 480 million kilometers away. The trip from Earth by ""Philae"" had taken ten years! The scientists had no idea what the surface of the comet would be like. If the landing failed, it would be impossible to get information from the spacecraft. Twenty years of work would have been wasted. When ""Philae"" tried to land, it bounced away from the comet's icy surface twice. Luckily, however, ""Philae"" landed successfully and began sending information back to Earth."	['they preferred to learn by themselves']

What benefit will distance learning program bring to a business?	Today, there are many chances for those who wish to continue their education. However, nearly all require some break in one's career in order to attend school full time. Part-time education, that is, attending school at night or for one weekend a month, tends to drag the process out over time and puts the completion of a degree program out of reach of many people. Additionally, such programs require a fixed time commitment which can also impact negatively on one's career and family time. Of the many approaches to teaching and learning, however, perhaps the most flexible is that called distance learning. Distance learning is an educational method which allows the students the flexibility to study at his or her own pace to achieve the academic goals which are so necessary in today's world. The time required to study may be set aside at the student's convenience. Additionally, the student may enroll in distance learning courses from actually any place in the world, while continuing to pursue their chosen career. Individual assistance may be available via regular airmail, telephone, fax machine, teleconferencing and over the Internet. Good distance learning programs are characterized by the inclusion of a subject evaluation tool with every subject, so a student doesn't need to travel away from home to take a test. Another characteristic of a good distance learning program is the equivalence of the distance learning course with the same subject materials as those students taking the course on the home campus. The resultant diploma or degree should also be the same whether distance learning or on-campus study is employed. The individuality of the professor/student relationship is another characteristic of a good distance learning program. In the final analysis, a good distance learning program has a place not only for the individual student but also the company or business that wants to work in partnership with their employees for the educational benefit, professional development, and business growth of the organization. Supporting distance learning programs for their employees gives the business the advantage of retaining career-minded people while contributing to their personal and professional growth through education.

There are both Vitamins A and D in _ .	The vitamins are named by letters of the alphabet . Vitamin A is needed by the eyes. There is Vitamin A in milk, butter, and green vegetables. It can be kept by the body. Vitamin B cannot be kept. It must be supplied all the time by some of the food we eat. Vitamin C is very important to the body. Without it men's teeth become loose and their arms and legs get weak. Lemons , oranges and tomatoes have Vitamin C in them. Vitamin D is the sun vitamin. We get it in milk and eggs and from sunlight on our skin . There are other Vitamins, but these A, B, C and D, are the most important.	['milk']
What should we do when we have no time for friends?	We all need friends and we always have. Our ancestors found that gaining the basic necessities of life was easier in a group. It's estimated that the maximum number of people who lived in early communities of hunter-gatherers was 150. Friends aren't bound(......)by blood or family bonds, employment contracts or legal obligations. Our circle of associates includes work colleagues and people we meet at parties, in the pub or on the train to work. Some associates are much more important than our family. We are capable of exchanging an email with these associates, and may have mutual acquaintances with a good number of them, providing common ground. We do things for one another because we want to. Whether writing an answer to a photo put on Facebook, sending a birthday card by post, or making a hospital visit, the efforts we have made for our friends are out of kindness. It is this nature of friendship which requires nothing in return that makes it beneficial and valuable. Friendships take work, and they need to be nurtured, nourished and maintained. We feel good about helping our friends because we are friends. However, we often lose touch with our friends because of a lack of time and energy. When we are carrying a heavy load at work, involved in a serious relationship or raising children, it's hard to spare time for friends. In these situations, we need to remind ourselves of what friends are for and why they can be so important in our lives. In a survey of more than 2,000 married couples aged 55 or older, for both men and women, having friends was the best predictor of being satisfied in marriage -- possibly because they were more satisfied with their lives as a result of having friends. Researchers suggest social relationships are the reason why women live longer than men, Social bonds reduce the risk of disease by reducing blood pressure, cholesterol and heart rate. A lack of good friends is as harmful to your health as smoking or being overweight. Indeed, people without friends are more likely to die younger. Not only do friendships prolong our lives, they make us happier too. People who are socially active don't feel so stressed or feel they can not enjoy anything easily -- they also tend to feel better about their lives and who they are.

If we don't release anger, _ .	"Have you ever hated anyone? Well, probably you don't really hate them. But you do get angry the moment you think of them. If you don't get out of the anger, it may turn into bitterness . Bitterness can come about when we can't forgive someone who has hurt us or made us angry. Someone might say or do something that hurts us. But we keep it deep inside instead of working through the anger. Before long, a bitter feeling begins to grow. The bitterness shows when we constantly criticize the one who hurt us. We may think we are hurting that person, but we are really only hurting ourselves. Bitterness is a harmful emotion that affects the whole body. It can lead to serious health problems such as high blood pressure. Bitterness can stop us from concentrating on important things. Instead, we waste time thinking about how we have been hurt. Finally, holding on to bitterness can hurt our relationships with friends and family members. No one enjoys being around an angry, negative person for very long. Author Chuck Swindoll once said, "" Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we respond to it."" That means when someone hurts you, your response is more important than what happened. You can choose to let go of hurt. You can also choose to hold on to hurt, which results in bitterness. If you see bitterness in your life, here are some ways to deal with it. Stop making excuses for it. You may feel you have a fight to be angry. You may even secretly enjoy making the other person look sad. But in the end, bitterness hurts you much more than the other person. Forgive and forget it. The best thing you can do is to forgive and forget. You probably can't totally put the act out of your mind. But you can decide to forgive the other person. Let it go and move on. You'll enjoy better health and peace of mind."	['A bitter feeling will develop in our mind']
Simpson was very happy when the writer greeted him because _ .	"""I say, I'm pleased to see you,"" said the little man standing by the letter-box. ""Oh, hello,"" I said, remembering he was a new neighbor. ""Simpson, isn't it?"" ""Yes, that's right."" He seemed quite pleased by my ready recognition. ""I wonder if you could lend me some money,"" he continued. ""My wife gave me a letter to post, and I've just noticed it isn't stamped."" ""yes, they never are,"" I said, sympathetically . ""It must go tonight--it really must! I'd get stamps out of the machine,"" explained Simpson,"" Only I find I have no small change about me."" ""I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I haven't either,"" I said. ""Oh, dear, dear,"" he said. ""Yes, well,"" I said, intending to move off. But he looked so unhappy standing there with the blue unstamped envelope that I really hadn't the heart to desert him. So I took him to my house and found some pennies and gave them to him, who, in the most business like way, made a note of the loan in his pocket-book, and left. But soon he turned up again. ""I'm sorry I am a stranger round here and --well, I'm rather lost..."" It took me several minutes to explain to him where the post office was. In the end I felt as lost as Simpson and had to accompany him to the post office, but, only to find the automatic stamp-machine was empty! ""Oh!"" Simpson was so desperate that he dropped the letter on the ground and when he picked it up there was a large black spot on its face. ""Dear me,"" he said, ""My wife told me to post it tonight. I'd better post it, if you know what I mean."" I did know. Or, at least, I knew Mrs Simpson. Then I got a good idea, ""Post the letter unstamped--let the other man pay double postage on it in the morning. "" And he had to agree. Finishing off our job, I took him home. ""I'm so grateful to you, really,"" he said when we reached his home. ""That letter--it's only an invitation to dinner to Mr... Dear me!"" ""Why, what's the matter?"" ""Nothing. Just something I've remembered."" ""What?"" But he didn't tell me. He just opened his eyes and his mouth at me like a wounded gold- fish, murmured a ""Good-night"", and went inside. All the way home I was wondering what it was that he had remembered. But I stopped wondering the next morning, when I had to pay the postman double postage for a blue envelope with a large black spot on its face."

Why does the British government send a delegation of experts to Shanghai?	"LONDON, Feb. 18,2014 (Xinhua News agency) --Britain will send experts to East China's Shanghai to learn from the city's experience in maths teaching in an attempt to raise the teaching standards. British Education Minister Elizabeth Truss is to lead a delegation of experts on a fact-finding mission to Shanghai's schools next week to see how children there have become the best in the world at maths, to get a first-hand look at maths classes and teaching methods there, and particularly to investigate why the performance of almost all children in Shanghai is high, regardless of gender or income. Britain was last year placed 50th out of 148 countries and regions in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness ranking in quality of maths and science education. Two years ago, Shanghai topped the 2012 international PISA tables for maths, while England was ranked in 26th place. The top five were all in Southeast Asia, with 15-year-olds in Shanghai judged to be three years ahead of their peers in maths. The education department said: ""England's performance in maths has lagged behind while other countries have improved and overtaken us, including Poland and Germany."" Actually, it is the latest step in the government's drive to raise standards in maths, looking at what has made schools in the far East the most successful in the world in teaching the subject. ""Shanghai is the top-performing part of the world for maths--their children are streets ahead. Shanghai and Singapore have teaching practices and a positive mind that make the difference. They have a belief that diligence makes up for lack of ability,"" Truss said. ""Our new curriculum has borrowed from theirs because we know it works--early learning of key arithmetic, and a focus on times tables and long division , for instance."" She was determined to change the situation as performance in maths is weakening the country's skills base and threatening the productivity and growth. The government is emphasizing maths because of the importance of good grades in the subject to young people competing for good jobs in a global labor market and to the economy more generally. An education and skills survey released by the Confederation of British Industry last year showed that 30 percent of employers reported dissatisfaction with the standard of school and college leavers' numeracy. More than two-thirds of employers said they wanted both maths and science promoted more in schools."	['To raise the teaching standards in maths in Britain.']
What's the best title of the passage?	"Zhang Ming, a college student from Shandong, created a 9-page ""WeChat guide"". With drawings and simple words, the step-by-step guide explains how to send messages, take pictures and make video calls. Zhang made the guide for his parents. ""My parents are getting old. They need an easy way to learn how to use new technology."" He said. Zhang's experience is common nowadays. Worldwide, 40 percent of parents learn about new technologies, including computers, mobile Internet and social media, from their children, according to a study from the International Communication Association in 2014. Parents used to teach their kids about almost everything. Now for the first time, the teachers become the students, and the students turn into the teachers. The change of roles comes from the rapid development of society and technology, says Zhou Xiaohong, a sociology professor from Nanjing University. Zhou said the Internet and other forms of media give children ways to get information besides from asking older generations . Therefore, in the age of information, it's possible that children know more than their parents do. According to the China Internet Network Information Center(CINIC), 56.7 percent of Internet users and 67.2 percent of social media users in China are under the age of 30. The younger generation usually acts as a _ between their family and the new environment. But when they teach their parents new technologies, parents can connect to the new world by themselves, noted Zhou. In Zhang Ming's eyes, teaching his parents about WeChat brings him closer to his parents. ""People can communicate more by using new technology. Why should we keep our parents out?"" said Zhang."

Which of the following is the common method to treat depression and anxiety?	"Have you ever had a doctor write you a prescription for three laps around a local trail ? How about a prescription for sit-ups? These treatments may not be as typical as the drugs that are usually used to treat our problems, but maybe they should be: a new report shows that regular exercise can be just as effective as prescription drugs for patients with depression and anxiety. ""Individuals who exercise report fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, and lower levels of stress and anger, "" said the paper's co-author, Jasper Smith, director of the Anxiety Research and Treatment Program at Southern Methodist University. "" Exercise may help patients with depression re-establish positive behaviors. For patients with anxiety disorders, exercise reduces their fears of fear and related bodily sensations such as a racing heart and rapid breathing."" In a separate study, published in Physical Therapy journal, scientists studied 161 women who' d recently given birth to babies, and decided them into two groups. New mothers tend to develop post-partum depression , and the scientists wanted to find out whether exercise could prevent such problems. One group of women was given specialized exercises as part of an eight-week parenting education program, while the other was given only written education. The physical element seemed to do the trick; the researchers report that the number of women identified as ""at risk"" for post-partum depression was reduced by half in the exercising group. Another recent study shows that even when a patient has a chronic illness like cancer or a heart condition, regular exercise can dramatically increase wellbeing by reducing anxiety. Researchers from University of Georgia analyzed 40 clinical trials involving almost 3,000 patients, and found that the patients who reported exercising regularly had a 20% reduction in symptoms of anxiety compared to those who didn't exercise. As a result, they were more likely to follow their recommended treatment plan. Of course, there are still some situations where prescription drugs are necessary, and we recommend you leave it to your doctor to determine when that may be. But in many cases, the best medicine may simply be to get up off the couch and go for a walk."	['Drug.']
More and more women want to get jobs because _ .	"People like to say:""The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.""Or theysay:""Behind every successful man,there is a woman."" Now some women still like making their husbands and sons successful.But some women want more for themselves.They want to be successful as men. Today the best jobs are still given to men.Even when women do the same work,they are often paid less than men.Some women want these things changed.They want to stand beside the men,with the same chances for success. Now many American women are earning money outside their homes.More than half of the women at the age of eighteen to sixty-five have good jobs.In general,working women have more education than those who stay at home. Among women with jobs,eight out of ten drive a car to work,and most of them often spend their holidays away from home.They like traveling by air.Women's work has made several changes in women's lives and in men's lives,too. But things are quite different from those in the Middle East countries. In the Middle East countries,women have to stay at home.They look after their families and do all the housework.They can't find work outside.When they go out in public.they cover their faces with something and walk behind their husbands. For the past few years the women's life has been changing in those countries.Many women want to play an active role in the society.Though working gives them few chances of getting married,many men still want to marry them in the old ways."

Where did Sarah smoke?	Dear Mom and Dad, I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you. I have been very naughty and the school master is very angry with me. She is going to write to you. You must come and take me away from here. She does not want me in the school any longer. The trouble started last night when I was smoking a cigarette in bed. As I was smoking, I heard footsteps coming towards the room .I did not want a teacher to catch me smoking, so I threw the cigarette away. Unfortunately, the cigarette fell into the waste--paper basket. It caught fire. There was a curtain near the waste --paper basket. It caught fire too. Soon the whole room was burning.

The master said that the fire was all my fault and I must pay for the damage. She will send you a bill for about a million dollars. I'm very sorry for this. Much love Sarah	['In the dormitory']
The writer wants to prove that_.	"Education is not an end , but a means to an end . In other words , we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them . Our purpose is to fit them for life . In some modern countries it has for some time been fashionable to think that by free education for all whether rich or poor , clever or stupid-one can solve all the problems of society and build a perfect nation . But we can already see that free education for all is not enough ; we find in such countries a far larger number of people with university degrees , they refuse to do what they think ""low"" work , and , in fact , work with hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries . But we have only to think a moment to understand that the work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor , we can live without education, but we would die if we have no food . If no one cleaned our streets and tooled the rubbish away from our houses , we should get terrible diseases in our towns ... In fact , when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life , it means that we must be educated in such a way that , firstly , each of us can do whatever work suited to his brains and ability and , secondly , that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society , and that is very bad to be ashamed of one's work . Only such a type of education can be considered valuable to society ."	['our society needs all kinds of jobs']
What was Peter doing when his mother called him home yesterday?	"Hello, I'm Peter in the second grade. Now I have one thing to say: It's not easy being a kid. Being a kid might look like fun, but sometimes it's not fun at all. Yesterday I was playing outside with my friend. We were having a good time. But suddenly, my mother said, ""Peter, it's time to come inside now. It's getting dark."" When you're an adult, no one can tell you what to do or when to do it. When you are a kid, you have to get up early in the morning and go to school. At school, you have to study math, English, science and history. After school, you have to do your homework. When you are an adult, you do not have to go to school and you never have homework to do. When you are a kid, the older kids sometimes _ you.

When you are a kid, you have to go to bed early. On school nights, my mom asks me to go to bed at 9:00 pm. But I do have parents who love me, which is really great. So I think I like being a kid, even though it's not easy being a kid. ,."	['He was playing with his friend.']
The potential readers of the text are _ .	Thinking about taking a year out before going to university?Check out your gap year choices here and decide if it's the right decision for you... What is it? It's a year out between finishing senior high school and starting university in which you can travel, work and generally do mind-broadening stuff you will never forget. I don't want to travel, but I don't know what I want to do at university. You will have a good three months between finishing your A Levels and university Clearing (when last-minute vacancies on courses for the coming academic year are advertised): surely enough time to decide what to do. You don't need to take a year for that. I need to take some money before starting university. Fair enough. But don't get comfortable and decide not to get a full-time job. Spending a year on income support will be depressing; you'll have nothing to say when future employers ask what you did in your gap year, and you'll have to put up with smug post-gap year students comparing notes when you start university. I'd love to travel, but I can't afford it. Most gap year students work for the first six months and then travel, using the money they've earned in the second six months. I'm scared. Try not to let fear of the unknown put you off seeing the world. Earth is a big planet, but when you travel it seems much smaller (even the remotest countries have email access).

The fairy helped the man because he was _ man.	"One day a poor man was cutting a big piece of wood near a river. Suddenly his old axe fell into the water. He felt very sad because he lost his only axe. Then all at once a beautiful fairy came out and asked the man what was the matter. ""I have lost my axe, ""he said. It fell into the water when I was cutting the wood. The fairy showed him a gold axe and asked, ""Is this yours?"". ""No,"" said the man. The fairy then showed him a silver axe and asked again, ""Is this yours?"" ""No,"" again answered the man. Then she showed him the old axe. ""Yes, that is mine,""called out the happy man. ""I know that well enough,"" said the fairy.""I only wanted to see if you would tell me the truth, and now I'll give you the gold axe and the silver axe besides your own one."""	['an honest']
We can see that the Erie Canal _ .	"The Erie Canal was the first important national waterway built in the US. It crossed New York from Buffalo on Lake Erie Troy to Albany on the Hudson River. It joined the Great Lakes with the Atlantic Ocean. The canal served as a route over which industrial goods could flow into the west, and materials could pour into the east. The Erie Canal helped New York develop into the nation's largest city. The building of the canal was paid for entirely by the state of New York. It cost $ 7 143 789, but it soon gained its price many times over. Between 1825, when the canal was opened, and 1882, when toll charges were stopped, the state collected $121 461 891. For a hundred years before the Erie was built, people had been talking about a canal which could join the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. The man who planned the Erie Canal and carried the plan through was De Witt Clinton. Those who were against the canal laughingly called it ""Clinton's Ditch "". Clinton talked and wrote about the canal and drew up plans for it. He and Governor Morris went to Washington in 1812 to ask for help for the canal, but they were unsuccessful. Clinton became governor of New York in 1817, and shortly afterwards, on July 4, 1817, broke ground for the canal in Rome, N.Y. The first part of the canal was completed in 1820. As the canal grew, towns along its course developed fast. The length of the canal is 363 miles."	['played an important part in developing New York City']
The best title for this passage might be _ .	"What is a good education? The question is far from being answered. Once more, colleges and universities are changing their programs: they _ ""fun courses"" and restart some of the traditional subjects neglected since the 1960s. Many great schools are again requiring the students to take a number of classes in English, history, literature, the social sciences, philosophy, the natural sciences, and art if they want to get a degree. Meanwhile, the experts are trying to describe the good education of our time. Obviously the purely vocational training once favored is not enough. But neither is the gentleman's education of the nineteenth century. Educational programs must meet the demands of a modern world where men and women have to work and to deal with big problems. What, then, is a good education of this century? Some educators suggest that it should include foreign languages and the study of foreign cultures; a mastery of English, including the ability to write and speak well, because communications have become all-important in the modern world, and also because ""a person who doesn't speak and write clearly doesn't reason clearly either""; some knowledge of the social sciences (sociology, psychology) that deal with human relations and human problems; some basic knowledge of modern science, which would enable future voters to be better informed about current problems like nuclear. Finally, many educators insist that all college graduates should be familiar with computers and modern information system since the educated professionals of tomorrow will have to understand their machines. Is that all? ""No, of course not."" answer the educators. ""We have not mentioned the two great building blocks of education: history and literature!"""	['A Good Education']
We can conclude from the text that _ .	"Today, we send millions of Christmas cards every year. But in fact the Christmas card is a ly modern invention. In the Middle Ages, European wood engravers produced prints with religious themes. But the first real Christmas card, as we understand the term today, was designed in London, England in 1840. It went on sale in 1843. The designer was John Callott Horsley, a well- known British painter and member of the Royal Academy. He designed the card at the suggestion of his friend Sir Henry Cole, who was the first director of the Victoria & Albert Museum. Horsley produced 1,000 cards and offered them for sale at 1s (one shilling) each. They were printed on stiff card and coloured by hand, with the greeting: ""A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to You"". The card shows three pictures: in the center, a family party; to one side the hungry receiving food; to the other side the poor being clothed. Puritans immediately _ the card, since it showed people drinking in the family party. But with most people the idea was a great success and the Christmas card quickly became very popular. Christmas cards were not the first greetings cards. Since 1796, with improvements in printing, merchants had been sending cards to their customers offering ""best wishes"" for the new year. In many countries, Christmas cards gradually became even more popular than New Year's cards. As Christmas is the birthday of Jesus Christ, cards often show scenes of His nativity. Others show images connected with Christmas such as wintry scenes of snow-laden pine, Father Christmas card is ""Merry Christmas"", but many other greetings are also used, such as ""Happy Xmas"" or ""Happy Noel""."	['Horsley sold his first Christmas cards for 50 pounds']
Why did the man feel that he could be lucky this time?	For eighty four days old Santiago had not caught a single fish. At first a young boy, Manolin, had shared his bad fortune, but after the fortieth luckless day the boy's father told his son to go in another boat. From that time on, Santiago worked alone. The boy loved the old fisherman and always helped him with money and food. Usually, they would talk about the fish they had taken in luckier times or about American baseball after supper, while at night, alone in his cottage, Santiago dreamed of lions on the beaches of Africa, where he had gone years before. _ On the eighty-fifth day, Santiago set off to fish before dawn. Two of his baits were fresh tunas the boy had given him, as well as sardines to cover his hooks. Then he set his lines which went straight down into deep dark water. As the sun rose he saw other boats in toward shore. A bird showed him where dolphins were chasing some flying fish. This time Santiago saw tuna jumping in the sunlight. A small one took the hook on his line. Pulling the fish aboard, the old man thought it a good fortune. Toward noon a marlin, a common fish in the sea, started eating the bait which was one hundred meters down. Gently the old man played the fish, a big one, as he knew from the weight on the line. At last he struck to settle the hook. The fish did not come out of the surface. Instead, it began to pull the boat to the northwest. The old man followed it. _ It was cold after the sunset. When something took one of his remaining baits, he cut the line with his knife. Once the marlin leaned suddenly, pulling Santiago forward on his face and cutting his cheek. By dawn his left hand was cramped . The fish had headed northward; there was no land in sight. Hungry, he cut pieces from the tuna and chewed them slowly. That morning the fish jumped. Seeing it, Santiago knew he had hooked the biggest marlin he had ever seen. Then the fish went down and turned toward the east. Santiago drank a little water from the bottle during the hot afternoon. Close to nightfall a dolphin took the small hook he had rebaited. He lifted it aboard, careful. After he had rested, he cut meat from the dolphin and kept also the two flying fish he found in its stomach. That night he slept. He awoke to feel the line running through his fingers as the fish jumped. Feeding line slowly, he tried to tire the marlin. After the fish slowed its run, he washed his cut hands in sea water and ate one of the flying fish. At sunrise the marlin began to circle. Faint, he worked to bring the big fish nearer with each turn. _ The fish was two feet longer than the boat. No fish like it had ever been seen in Havana harbor. An hour later, he sighted the first shark, a fierce Mako, and it came in fast to chase after the dead marlin. The old man struck the shark with his harpoon. The Mako rolled and sank, carrying the harpoon with it and leaving the marlin bloody. He knew the smell would spread. Watching, he saw two sharks closing in. He struck at one with his knife and watched it sliding down into deep water. The other he killed while it tore at the flesh of the marlin. When the third appeared, he thrust it with the knife. The other sharks came at sunset. At first he tried to beat them with the tiller from the boat, but his hands were bleeding and there were too many in the sea. In the darkness, as he steered toward the harbor of Havana, he heard them hitting the boat again and again. But the old man thought only of his steering and his great tiredness. He had gone out too far and the sharks had beaten him. He knew they would leave him nothing but the stripped skeleton of the big marlin. All lights were out when he sailed into the little harbor and beached his boat. He could just make out the white backbone and the upstanding tail of the fish. _ In his cottage he fell on his bed and went to sleep.	['Because a small tuna took the hook on his line.']
What attitude of the Mom towards her daughter's suggestion at first?	"She had been shopping with her Mom in Wal-Mart. She must have been 6 years old, this beautiful brown haired, freckle-faced image of innocence. It was pouring outside. We all stood there under the awning and just inside the door of the Wal-Mart. We all waited, some patiently, others irritated, because nature messed up their hurried day. I am always memorized by rainfall. I get lost in the sound and sight of the heavens washing away the dirt and dust of the world. Memories of running, splashing so carefree as a child come pouring in as a welcome reprieve from the worries of my day. Her voice was so sweet as it broke the trance we were all caught in, ""Mom, let's run through the rain."" she said. ""What?"" Mom asked. ""Let's run through the rain!"" She repeated. ""No, honey. We'll wait until it slows down a bit."" Mom replied. This young child waited about another minute and repeated: ""Mom, let's run through the rain."" ""We'll get soaked if we do."" Mom said. ""No, we won't, Mom. That's not what you said this morning,"" the young girl said as she pulled her Mom's arm."" ""This morning? When did I say we could run through the rain and not get wet?"" ""Don't you remember? When you were talking to Daddy about his cancer, you said, if God can get us through this, he can get us through anything!"" _ No one came or left in the next few minutes. Mom paused and thought for a moment about what she would say. Now some would laugh it off and scold her for being silly. Some might even ignore what was said. But this was a moment of affirmation in a young child's lifetime when innocent trust can be nurtured so that it will bloom into faith. ""Honey, you are absolutely right. Let's run through the rain. If get wet, well maybe we just need washing."" Mom said. Then off they ran. We all stood watching, smiling and laughing as they ran past the cars . They held their shopping bags over their heads just in case. They got soaked but they were followed by a few who screamed and laughed like children all the way to their cars. And yes, I did. I ran. I got wet. I needed washing. Circumstances or people can take away your material possessions, they can take away your money, and they can take away your health. But no one can ever take away your precious memories. So, don't forget to make time and take the opportunities to make memories every day!"	['Negative']
How old was Thomas Jefferson when he became Governor of Virginia?	As we all know, it was Thomas Jefferson who wrote the Declaration of the Independence. He wrote it in two weeks, and after a few changes, it was accepted by the Congress. As a result, he became famous. Born in Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, a brilliant student at school and almost talented lawyer later, was much interested in politics. Jefferson was elected Governor of Virginia in 1779, and he was sent to France as the representative of the American government in 1784. Sixteen years later, at the age of 57, he was elected president after Washington and Adams. Far from a handsome man, he was tall with long arms and big hands. Jefferson, who was an amusing talker in conversation but a poor speaker, was generally good-natured. Jefferson was regarded as a defender of freedom on America. As a president, he protected the right of free speech. Interestingly enough, in his eight years as President, Jefferson never vetoed a bill which Congress had passed. He did a lot in organizing the new University of Virginia. Thomas Jefferson died on July the fourth, 1826, the 50th anniversary of American Independence.	['He was 36.']
What can be inferred from the passage?	"Our planet is home to about seven billion people. Since the 1990s, population experts have predicted the number would grow to nine billion before it begins to slow down and possibly decrease. But a new report predicts the world's population is likely to increase to almost 11 billion by 2100. Based on the most modern statistical tools, the new report makes use of government records and considers expert predictions, including death rates, birthrates and international migration, or people moving across borders. The report says during the rest of this century, Africa's population will grow from about 3.5 billion to 5.1 billion over the next 85 years John is director of the United Nations Population Division. He says that in the past, researchers thought population growth in Africa would be similar to that of other areas. They expected slower growth rates as birth control use became more widespread. But he says those ideas were wrong. ""The level of contraception use has continued to increase but slowly -- more slowly than expected, and birthrate therefore has been falling less rapidly than expected, and the population therefore continues to grow somewhat more rapidly than we expected.The new findings are based on a joint research project of the United Nations and the University of Washington. The researchers believe the population of Asia will reach five billion by 2050. That is up from the current 4.4 billion. And then begin to decline. The researchers also believe that North America, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean area will have a total population of below one billion. John says the pressure of feeding the rising population is likely to be less than that might be expected. ""The relatively good news is that the world has been winning the race between population growth and food production. If you look back historically over the last 50 years, certainly for the world as a whole and for many, most individual countries and regions, the increase in food production has outpaced the increase of population.||"""	['John is optimistic about feeding the rising population.']
According to this passage, teen bloggers mostly _ .	"It's cool, it's hot, and everyone is doing it. People talk about _ often,and friends tell other friends how good they look. Sound like a fashion? It's actually trend : ""blog"". What's a blog? A blog is a personal online diary. The word ""blogger"" means a person who writes diaries online. Many bloggers are teens who've been logging onto sites to talk about anything in their lives. Many of today's teenagers are not afraid to openly discuss everything in their lives. Teens complain about parents and homework. They share diaries, post songs from the latest bands and show pictures of theirs. They write their own poems , say something about their girlfriends or boyfriends and complain to each other or offer support. But mostly they just write down what they do every day. However, many parents are afraid of these young bloggers. Parents see the kids talking about how they got drunk last weekend and how they don't like studying. They are using language that is surprising to their parents. Besides hearing from their friends, teen bloggers also get messages from strangers. Most of the time, it's older men asking to meet teenage girls. ""These strange men are dangerous for my kids. They sometimes teach my kids bad words,"" said Cara Cabral, a mother of two. Many teens and young adults know it's not safe to use blogs on the Internet. They know they are putting information about themselves in a place they can be seen by anyone. But teens are unlikely to give up these new communication tools that have become a way of life for many of them. Are you a blogger? What do you think of the blog?"

According to the author, America is _ .	"Are you competitive enough to make it in America? There is an undeniable excitement about coming to study in the U.S., but it's not all excitement. Yes, it is America; it is the land of freedom; it's the place where different cultures clash ... and live together in peace. However, you guys might agree with me. it's not easy to leave home and the security of family, friends and people who love and care about us. And doing it raises some questions: Is it worth it? Are you equal to the challenge? You might be sitting in front of your computer watching a documentary about America, which shows you the breathtaking views of skyscrapers in New York, the beautiful warm weather in San Diego, and the huge parties along the beaches of the Sunshine State, Florida. Just so you know, it's all true. I remember how my heart was racing the first time I visited Times Square in New York. I can't find any words in the dictionary to describe how I felt at that moment. Someday, when you get lucky and go there, you will know what I mean. Unfortunately, TV and movies never show the other side of what students must do to survive America. Education in the States is really different from other places. Yes, there is the traditional A, B, C, and D grading system, and you get to be on the Dean's List if you have all A's on your transcript. However, these grades don't just come from your test performances. The requirements of classes in the U.S. are much more varied and this is the biggest adjustment that overseas students have to manage. Some have papers that you have to write every week, others have group projects you must do with your classmates, presentations you make in the class, or research you do by yourself to prove your own idea. There comes a night when you have a couple of projects for different classes, a paper, and an exam to study for. And that night you ask yourself, ""What did I get myself into?"" I'm not trying to intimidate you, but you should know what it really is like to study in the States. One thing I can promise you is that it is worth all the hard work you put in. And the more time you give to your study, the more open doors you will have by the time you finish your degree."	['a place where people from different backgrounds get on well']
What can we learn about the future English language?	"The world is changing so fast that English, perhaps the most worldly of languages, is struggling to keep up. Learners in the future are likely to be much younger. Young children are often said to be better at language learning than older learners but they also have special challenges. Young children don't usually have the kind of instrumental motivation and determination for learning English that older learners often have. English lessons must therefore be fun and rewarding. The reasons why people learn English are also changing. Globalization is bringing together more people than ever who speak different languages and who are turning to English as the means of communication. The English learners of the future may be less worried about sounding exactly like a native speaker and more concerned about how to use English effectively in cross-cultural communication. We may be hearing more non-native speakers in dialogues and a wider range of the ""New Englishes"" now used around the world. Technology will allow English to come to you, rather than you having to go to a special place to learn English. Learning English has always involved both pain and pleasure, private effort and social activity. Traditional learning provided take-it or leave-it mixes of these as well as of content but in future learners will be able to choose a plan which suits their cultural and psychological dispositions , or their particular needs at that moment. They, rather than their teachers, will decide how, what and when they will learn. Above all, learning English is about communication and an important benefit of learning English is being able to exchange views and make friends with people all over the world. Despite the growing independence of learners, trusted institutions and brand names will remain important."	['Many different kinds of Englishes will appear.']

Which of the following statements is TRUE?	"How do you spend a usual holiday at home? My alarm clock wakes me, which reminds me of school.

Which can be the best title for the text?	Teenagers are often a difficult group. With all those hormones flooding their bodies, they can be moody, unpredictable, and tend to make uncertain choices. But however confusing their teenage years are, kids can still be generally happy, depending on their lifestyle choices. According to a new research by British scientists, teens who don't smoke, drink only moderately or not at all, and who don't eat much junk food are likely to be happier than other teens. The study looked at 40,000 British families and came up with some interesting findings. For example, kids who never drank alcohol were up to six times more likely to report higher levels of happiness than kids who drank. And teens who smoked were five times less likely to rate high on happiness charts compared to kids who don't smoke. Same goes for diet and physical activity. The more fruits and vegetables kids eat, and the more hours they spend playing sports, the happier they are. Now, of course this doesn't mean that not smoking or drinking, and playing sports guarantees happiness. It could be that kids who have happy character tend to be more active and less addicted to drinking or smoking. And it could equally be the case that kids who are unhappy are more related to drinking and smoking and eating junk food. Other studies have shown that exercise is a proven way to treat anxiety and depression. Future studies may support the idea that other healthful behaviors, including refraining from smoking, drinking, and eating too much junk, can avoid sadness and increase happiness, too.

Why does the author say that greyhounds make great pets?	Most people think of racing when they see greyhounds and believe they need lots of exercise. They can actually be quite lazy! Greyhounds are good at fast races but not long-distance running. They do need regular exercise but they like to run for a short burst and then get back on the bed or a comfortable seat. Another misunderstanding is that greyhounds must be aggressive because they are big in size. In fact greyhounds love people and are gentle with children. Greyhounds can live for 12 - 14 years but usually only race for two or three years, and after that they make great pets. They don't need a lot of space, don't make a lot of noise, and don't eat a lot for their size. Normally, greyhounds can be as tall as 90 cm. There is, however, a small-sized greyhound, which stands only 33 cm. Greyhounds come in a variety of colors. Grey and yellowish-brown are the most common. Others include black, white, blue, red and brown or a mix of these. Greyhounds have smooth body coats, low body fat and are very healthy. Because they're slim they don't have the leg problems like other dogs the same height . But they do feel the cold, especially since they would much rather be at home in bed than walking around outside.	['They are quiet and easy to look after.']
The study was done in _ countries in total in 2009.	Recently, we've been talking about how we need better teachers. There's no doubt that a great teacher can help in a student's achievement but here's what some new studies are also showing: We need better parents. Every three years, the organization called O.E.C.D. organizes exams as part of the Program for International Student Assessment , or PISA, which tests 15-year-olds on their abilities to solve real problems. America's 15-year-olds have not done as well as students in Singapore, Finland and Shanghai in the PISA exams. To better understand the reasons, the PISA team, starting with four countries in 2006, and then adding 14 more in 2009, went to the parents of 5,000 students. They interviewed them about how they raised their kids and then compared it with the test results for each of those years. Two weeks ago, the PISA team published the main findings of its study: Fifteen-year-olds whose parents often read books with them during their first year of primary school get much higher scores in PISA 2009 than students whose parents don't often read with them or not at all. Parents' concern for their children is strongly connected with better results in PISA. According to Schleicher, the leader of the team, just asking your children how their school day was and showing great interest in their learning can help a lot. It is something every parent can do, no matter what their education level. The study found that getting parents concerned about their children's learning at home is more powerful than parents attending parent-teacher meetings, volunteering in classrooms, taking part in money-raising, and showing up at back-to-school nights. To be sure, nothing can replace a good teacher. But let's stop putting the whole responsibility on teachers. We also need better parents. Better parents can make teaching more effective .	['18']
It can be inferred from the passage that at the service the author must have felt _	The last exams finished on Thursday, June 3, although I completed my final one on Monday morning. This allowed several days of rest* after which the seniors had their yearbook signing party, signing yearbooks. Every year US high schools put together yearbooks made up of pictures and words that record the lives of the students. On Friday the seniors had dinner with invited teachers. The dinner was formal, which meant we couldn't wear T-shirts or jeans. Both the food and the conversation were very good. At the end, everyone received a blue Andover Class of 2004 cup as a souvenir. Most of the graduation activities were packed into Commencement Weekend--June 5 and 6. Friends and families of students arrived to see the Senior Talent Show and the Baccalaureate Service in the school hall. Several students, parents and teachers of several religious faiths spoke during the service. Then the lights were turned off and students lit candles held by audience members. I held my candle high, and watched the soft light reach every corner of the hall; it was an almost sacred scene. On Sunday, we had our Commencement, held outside on the lawn . All the girls were required to wear white dresses and the guys black suits. It was only 9 degrees Centigrade and I was freezing cold.

A 13-year-old Russian, Daniil Korotkikh, was walking with his parents on a beach when he saw something lying in the sand. ""I saw that bottle and it looked interesting,"" Korotkikh told The Associated Press on Tuesday. ""it looked like a German beer bottle and there was a message inside. "" It said, ""My name is Frank, and I'm five years old. My dad and I are traveling on a ship to Denmark. If you find this letter, please write back to me, and I will write back to you."" The letter, dated 1987, included an address in the town of Coesfeld. The boy in the letter, Frank Uesbeck, is now 29. His parents still live at the letter's address. The Russian boy and the German man met each other earlier this month through an internet video link. The Russian boy said he did not believe that the bottle actually spent 24 years in the sea. He believed it had been hidden under the sand where he found it for a long time. Uesbeck was especially happy that he was able to have a positive effect on a life of a young person far away from Germany. ""It's really a wonderful story,"" he said. ""And who knows? Perhaps one day we will actually be able to arrange a meeting in person. """	['Message in a bottle.']

Which of the following statements is true of the women in a control group?	"Warning: reading too much Cinderella to your daughter may damage her emotional health in later life. A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero. Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. ""They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,"" she said."" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners."" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. ""The question,"" said Ms Darker Smith, ""is why she did not break the door down herself."""	"[""They don't believe in the transformational qualities of love.""]"
According to the passage,what can a volunteer do in nursing homes?	"For many people,volunteering is a way of life.Holidays are the time of the year that more people are in a giving mood.Homeless shelters,children's hospitals,and nursing homes are excellent places to give of one's time. Volunteering in Homeless Shelters There is a homeless directory online that anyone can easily access to find the closest homeless shelter to their home.According to the homeless shelter directory,currently there are 3,233 shelters in the US,so it is not difficult to find a shelter.Helping to serve food,picking up donations of food,preparing meals,and cleaning up are things that one can do to help at a homeless shelter. Volunteering in Children's Hospitals Every child needs comfort and joy,especially during the holiday seasons.By visiting sick children in hospitals,an individual provides helping hands by supplementing the services usually done by the hospital staff.Personalizing the hospital experience adds to the comfort and happiness of the children and their families.Volunteers provide help,and positive interactions which enhance the patient's quality of care.Help is needed almost everywhere in a hospital;from the lobby,parking lot,cafeteria,to admitting,helping with the gift cart,and even reading to children in the waiting rooms or their hospital rooms. Volunteering in Nursing Homes According to the National Center for Health Statistics,""Over 50% of those living in nursing homes do not have close relatives and 46% have no living children."" Life in a nursing home is lonely,confusing,and frightening for many residents. Volunteering at a nursing home is a great opportunity to make a difference in someone else's life.Playing cards,sitting with and talking to a resident,taking a walk,or sharing a meal makes a huge difference,especially when they have no other sole on earth to visit them. The three examples above are only a small fraction of institutions in which volunteers are needed.Giving of oneself,especially during the holidays blesses and cheers others."

When were the windmills used to produce electricity in some places?	Think about the different ways that people use the wind. You can use it to fly a kite or to sail a boat. Wind is one of our cleanest and richest power sources, as well as one of the oldest. Something shows that windmills began to be used in ancient Iran back in the seventh century BC. They were first introduced to Europe during the 1100s, when armies returned from the Middle East with knowledge of using wind power. For many centuries, people used windmills to make wheat into flour or get water from deep underground. When electricity was discovered in the late 1800s, people living in faraway areas began to use them to produce electricity. This allowed them to have electric lights and radio. However, by the 1940s when electricity was available to people in almost all areas of the United States, windmills were hardly used. During the 1970s, people started becoming more cared about the pollution that is created when coal and gas are burned to produce electricity. People also realized that the supply of coal and gas would run out one day. Then, wind was rediscovered, though it means higher costs. Today, there is a global movement to supply more and more of our electricity through the use of wind	['In the 1800s']
"Which description about the ""Sweeping Old Lady"" is right?"	"On Jan. 3, a netizen nicknamed ""Programmer Humor""published a short story on his micro-blog. It said that there was an old lady who swept nearly every inch of his Internet company. When she passed by a programmer, she took a look at the codes on the programmer's computer and kindly reminded him, ""Be careful, the stack is overfilled!"" Certainly, it is a casual and fictitious story made up by the micro-blogger. However, no one would have guessed that the short blog would eventually cause the first great Internet meme of 2011 in China. Suddenly, the mysterious ""Sweeping Old Lady"" is showing up nearly everywhere and reminding professionals of their mistakes. From 8 a. m. on Jan. 5, some netizens collected stories of the ""Sweeping Old Lady"" and found she had appeared to give advice in 150 kinds of careers. A netizen even said he had met with a similar situation in real life. Actually, the ""Sweeping Old Lady"" is not new figure, but is based on the ""sweeping monk ""in Louis Cha's famous Kung fu novel of ""Tian Long Ba Bu"". The ""sweeping monk"" is an old monk and does the lowest class of work in Shaolin Temple, but he is actually the No. 1 master in the noel both in Kung fu and in the study of Buddhism. The ""Sweeping Old Lady"" is also a great modest master. Lots of netizens wish that they could have such a lady beside them to give them precious suggestions at a key time.

According to Elon Musk, the trip to Mars is significant because _ .	"A MILLION people on Mars within 100 years. This is the brave vision of Elon Musk, the founder of the space technology company SpaceX. ""We need to be laser-focused on becoming a multi-planet civilization. That's the next step,"" he said in a recent interview with Aeon magazine. Musk expects to see about 80,000 people living on Mars by 2040. It's all about protecting the human race from extinction, according to Musk. The Earth has always been a ticking time bomb. As the sun begins to die, it will grow bigger, becoming what is known as a Red Giant. In 500 million years, the sun will have become large enough to kill off any plant and animal life on Earth, according to US scientist Edward Guinan. In a billion years, the Earth will have become a hot planet with little or no water. The brave dream of getting the human race to Mars is not only Musk's; others have made plans, too. A Dutch entrepreneur set up the Mars One foundation in 2011, hoping to be the first project to put humans on Mars. It received over 200,000 applications to become part of the first group of astronauts to go there. According to Mars One, ""human settlement on Mars is possible with existing technologies."" Water, food, energy, and oxygen are needed for life anywhere. According to Mars One, water that was still in the Martian soil would be boiled and taken out. By using a process called ""electrolysis"", astronauts could split water into hydrogen and oxygen for breathing. Astronauts on the International Space Station have already done similar things. Food can also be grown in space. Certain plants such as lettuce and onions can be grown using LED light for different color spectrums and much less heat. NASA has been researching this to prepare for visiting Mars. But how will people get there? The Mars One project plans to use SpaceX's Dragon capsule as part of its mission. But it is rumored that Musk already has a design in mind for a giant spaceship. He calls it the Mars Colonial Transporter."	['settlement on Mars could save the human race from extinction']
What did the 18th birthday mean to the young man?	"When he was 16, his father seriously said to him, ""I'll give you whatever you want before you are 18. But after that, I won't care much about you, and you should give me whatever I want."" When his 18th birthday was coming, the young man began thinking about looking for a job. So he sent resumes to many companies he liked on the Internet. But, most got no reply, he said, ""Maybe they were surprised about my primary school education."" By chance, one of his friends was looking for someone, who could work as an egg porter in the supermarket, for 0.5 Yuan a box. Facing lots of difficulties in getting a job, he said, ""I'll take this job. At least I can make some money for my petrol ."" Then every day, he drove his car, his 18th birthday gift, to work in the supermarket. He did that for three months. Later, he heard that a newspaper was looking for a network technician , so he asked for it. But they were also worried about his school education. He practiced his skill right in front of the computer, and showed the managers web pages he had designed.

Why did Paul Lindsay come to Tuvalu?	"Tuvalu is located in the South Pacific. It is tiny and has only nine islands with a population of just 11,000. In 1999, it was the third- poorest country in the world. The islanders earned just $1,000 each year. But then something unusual happened. Tuvalu received an internet domain name--the letters ""tv"". These letters were very interesting for many companies around the world. A communication company from California offered to buy the domain name ""tv"" for $40 m. For the Tuvalans this was a very large amount of money. The islanders became very rich. Because of global warming, and because the islands are only 3m above sea level, Tuvalu will probably become the first country in the world that will disappear under the sea. You can already see signs of the rising sea on Tuvalu. Some beaches are disappearing and you can see tree roots by the ocean. Cyclones used to be very rare but they now appear a few times a year, and the rains that come with the cyclones cause flooding. Despite these problems, the Tuvalans had their new money. They could use it to buy themselves a future. Or at least they could use it to buy some time. Paul Lindsay, a documentary film-maker, took these questions with him all the way to Tuvalu, and came back with an incredible story. As the water rises, the Tuvalans are using the money to develop the land. They are building new houses, planning nightclubs, restaurants and hotels and new cars are driving around on new roads. The residents do not think this is strange: ""Just because we are sinking, it doesn't mean we don't want to raise our standards of living."" Sam Teo, Tuvalu's minister for natural resources told Lindsay."	['To know how the Tuvalans survive despite all of their problems.']
When the author realized the man nearby was homeless, she _ .	"The cold wind cut through my enthusiasm as a tourist in Washington D.C., so I entered the nearest restaurant for warmth. I ordered a hot cup of coffee, and began observing people. Some people were having dinner in the great hall, which made me consider an early dinner. At that time, I observed a man seated nearby and, from his eager eyes, I realized that he noticed the delicious food. His tired body and worn clothes shouted, ""Homeless, homeless!"" I wondered how long it had been since he had eaten. I expected him to approach me for a handout . He never did. A silent war broke out in my head --one side was telling me to mind my own business, and the other was urging me to offer him the food. While my inner debate moved on, a well-dressed young couple walked up to him. ""Excuse me, sir,"" the husband began. ""We just finished eating, and our appetites weren't as big as we thought. We hate to waste good food. Can you help us out and put this to use?"" He gave the man some food. ""Thank you. Merry Christmas!"" the man replied. The man carefully watched his new food, and was about to drink the soup and eat the food seriously. Something that happened next shocked me. An old man, with pants, an old jacket and open shoes, entered the hall and walked to our direction. The man who was just offered the food saw the situation. Setting aside his meal, he stood up and guided the old man to the table. Then he put his worn jacket over the old man's shoulders. ""Hi, my name's Jack,"" he said, ""and one kind person brought me this meal. I just finished eating and hate to waste good food. Can you help me out?"" The old man answered gratefully, ""Sure, but only if you go halfway with me on that sandwich."" I left the restaurant that day feeling warmer than I had ever thought possible."

What is the similarity of the four hotels?	"Tayka Hotel de Sal Where:Tahua, Bolivia How much:about $95 a night Why it's cool:You've stayed at hotels made of brick or wood, but salt? That's something few can claim. Tayka Hotel de Sal is made totally of salt--including the beds (though you'll sleep on regular mattresses and blankets). The hotel sits on the Salar de Uyuni, a prehistoric driedup lake that's the world's biggest salt flat. Builders use the salt from the 4,633squaremile flat to make the bricks, and glue them together with a paste of wet salt that hardens when it dries. When rain starts to dissolve the hotel, the owners just mix up more salt paste to strengthen the bricks.

Which of the following is NOT one of things that Steve Jobs has done?	Despite knowing he was dying, Steve Jobs, former CEO of Apple, worked for more than a year to make plans for four years of new products that he believed would maintain the company's future. It was also revealed that Jobs fought hard to get plans approved for a spaceship-style company headquarters in California. It will be big enough to hold 12,000 employees in a park-like setting near the existing base in Cupertino, the global headquarters of Apple. He appeared at a town council meeting in June to promote the planning. He was also overseeing the development of the delayed iCloud project, which will allow Apple users to store their music, photos and other documents remotely, and designing updated versions of the iPod, iPad, iPhone and MacBooks, ensuring that at least four years' worth of products will go smoothly. Pre-order sales of the first official biography of Steve Jobs have increased by 44,000 percent. According to the official description, the book, out on October 24, 2011, is based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years - as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, competitors and colleagues. Steve Jobs died on October 5, 2011, aged 56, following a long battle with cancer. Jobs is survived by a wife, a son and two daughters.

What may be the importance of the research?	"Scientists say they now have proof to support the old-fashioned advice that it's best to sleep on a problem. They say sleep strengthens the memory and helps the brain organize the masses of information we receive each day. Lead researcher Bob Stickgold at the Harvard Medical School said, ""Sleep helps us draw rules from our experiences. It's like knowing the difference between dogs and cats even if it's hard to explain."" The US research team studied how well students remembered connections between words and symbols , reports New Scientist. They compared how the students performed if they had had a sleep between seeing the words and having the test, and if they had not slept. They found that people were better able to remember lists of related words after a night's sleep than after the same time spent awake during the day. They also found it easier to remember themes that the words had in common. But they forgot around one in four more themes if they had been awake. Prof. John Groeger, of Surrey University's Sleep Research Centre, said, ""People have been trying for years to find out what the purpose of sleep is, as we know that only certain parts of it have a restorative value. "" ""We form and store huge numbers of experiences in the head every day, and sleep seems to be the way the brain deals with it all."""	['It shows sleep may help us manage information']
Compared with job cuts, pay cuts can bring the following benefits EXCEPT that _ .	"From bankers to factory staff, employees in the West face a cold _ of losing their jobs as a global recession starts to bite. For colleagues in the East, the pain is more likely to come through a pay cut. Human resource experts say cultural differences explain why Asian companies try harder to preserve jobs in difficult times, which will prevent unemployment and may help Asian economies survive at a time of slowing exports. The East Asian attitude may also make it easier for companies to recover quickly from the economic downturn since they will not need to rehire or train new staff, but build up a more loyal and devoted group. ""In the Confucian mindset , the right thing to do is to share the burden , which is the sense of collective responsibility. While in the West, it's more about individual survival,"" said Michael Benoliel, associate professor of organizational behavior at Singapore Management University (SMU). In contrast, local Western companies from General Motors to Goldman Sachs plan to lay off workers by the thousands, but at the Asian units of Western multinationals or western units of Asian groups, job cuts will probably be less severe. Japan's jobless rate was 4 percent in September, up from 3.8 percent in January, while Hong Kong's was flat at 3.4 percent. But US unemployment is expected to have jumped to 6.3 percent last month from below 5 percent in January. Experts say that while there are noticeable differences in labor practices in East and West, the gap will narrow as more firms become more multinational and competition forces firms to adopt the best practices of rivals from abroad."

All of the following are the reasons for desertification in northern China EXCEPT _	Until late April, northern China had experienced eight severe sandstorms this year alone, worsening the air quality in half the region's cities. This year's sandstorms are considered more severe than before. Not only are they increasing in frequency and having more serious effects on air quality, but they are also occurring earlier in the season and affecting a wider area. The timing of the first sandstorm moved up by a week this year, and the sandstorm-affected area has extended beyond 3 million square kilometers. The reason for the frequent dust storms is worsening desertification in China's northern areas, caused by a combination of warm, dry weather and the rapid spread of agriculture. The dust-affected area is likely to expand to the northeast in the near future as a large area of grassland in Inner Mongolia's northern plain turns rapidly to desert. Due to its lack of rainfall and overall surface dryness in the spring, Beijing experiences sandstorms every March and April. The most recent sandstorm hit the capital on April 17 and was the worst in five years. For about 40 days every year, the pollutants cannot be diffused, as the city's location makes it a natural container for accumulating sand and dust. Rapid urban development is affecting Beijing's air quality as well. To _ the dust from hundreds of new construction sites, authorities have issued rules asking builders to cover all working areas, pack down loose dirt, and wash vehicle tires when leaving the sites.

This article mainly talks about _ .	"A new American report says water-related problems will likely increase tensions around the world in the next ten years. These problems include water shortages, poor water quality and floods. The problems will increase the risk of failure of governments. However, countries are unlikely to go to war over water. But the real question is that some governments may use water as a weapon to pressure others ten years later. The report looks at possible effects of water problems on the United States national security interests over the next thirty years. It says the areas that will be most affected by water problems are North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia. The United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says, ""Reliable water resources are essential for feeding the hungry, running industries and creating energy. Certainly they are central when we think about how climate changes will affect future generations."" The report also predicts an increased demand for American assistance and expert help to solve those problems. That demand for help could create opportunities for leadership and influence. Water shortages, poor water quality, and floods are unlikely to result in state failure. But these could combine with poverty, social tensions, environmental problems, poor leadership and weak governments to produce social disorder. And that combination could cause state failure. The report predicts that from now through 2040 water shortages and pollution probably will harm the economic performance of important trading partners. During the next ten years the loss of groundwater supplies in some agricultural areas will create a risk to national and global food markets. These shortages will be a result of poor management. Agriculture uses about seventy percent of the world's freshwater. The report says technology that reduces the amount of water needed to grow crops will offer the best way to fight against water shortages."	['effects of water problems around the world']
According to Tom Frieden, how is a person mainly infected by MERS?	MERS, also known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, has made its way to the US. The second patient was in Orlando, Florida while the first reported case was in Indiana. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the disease has mainly been transmitted by close personal contact, such as directly caring for a very ill person. The virus is formally called MERS-CoV because it's part of the corona virus family that includes the common cold and severe SARS. SARS was ly easy to stop a decade ago, because it was being transmitted by caged animals in Chinese markets. MERS-CoV was first identified in people in 2012, but has been spreading rapidly since March, 2015. The vast majority of those cases occurred in Saudi Arabia. The patient in Orlando felt ill on the first flight but not ill enough to notify a doctor. Early on May 9, he apparently became concerned that he was still feeling ill, and he went to the emergency room at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital. He identified himself as recently having been in Saudi Arabia, so he was quickly isolated to avoid infecting other patients. Wayne Marasco, an expert at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, said his biggest concern about MERS-CoV is how little we know about it. It's still not clear, in some instances, where the virus comes from, how it is transmitted or who is most subject.	['By close personal contact.']
When hearing Mrs. Leonard words, the author felt _ .	"I grew up knowing I was different, and I hated it. I was born with a cleft lip, and when I started to go to school, my classmates were constantly laughing at me. I couldn't even blow up a balloon. When my classmates asked, ""What happened to your lip?"" I'd tell them that I'd fallen as a baby and cut it on a piece of glass. Somehow it seemed more acceptable to have suffered an accident than to have been born different. Then I entered the second grade, and Mrs. Leonard's class. She was round and pretty. Everyone loves her. But no one came to love her more than I did. And for a special reason. The time came for the yearly ""hearing tests"". I was nearly unable to hear anything out of one ear. So I cheated. I had learned to watch other children and raised my hand when they did during group testing. The ""whisper test"" required a different trick: each child would go to the door of the classroom, turn sideways and cover one ear with a finger. And the teacher would say something very quietly from her desk, which the child would repeat. Then the same thing was done for the other ear. Nobody checked to see how tightly the untested ear was being covered, so I pretended to cover mine. My turn came. I turned my bad ear to her, covering the other ear with my finger, and then gently backed my finger out enough to be able to hear. I waited, and then heard the words that God had surely put into her mouth; seven words that changed my life forever. Mrs. Leonard, the pretty teacher I loved, said softly, ""I wish you were my little girl."""	['moved']
Ricci paints his unique smog artworks aiming to _ .	"If you're in Florence, Italy, and see a man on a ladder wiping the dust off statues and buildings, don't worry.It's just Alessandro Ricci gathering material for his famous smog paintings. Ricci is not a common artist, because he used smog as the main medium of his artworks. Unlike other painters seeking fast recognition of their talent, he doesn't really care about ""being this big artist"".Instead he is more concerned about bringing attention to how much smog there really is in his home town and how it's destroying both its monuments and people. Although he did take a couple of art classes a few years back, he is mainly self-taught, doesn't work in a studio, donates most of his work, and refuses to play by the rules of the Florentine Art Gallery, which he considers corrupt.Alessandro Ricci believes selling his smog paintings will not only compromise his principles, but also contradict the very thing he's trying to do-raise awareness about smog pollution in this city. Alessandro lives with his parents nearby Florence, but almost every day he visits the streets of the city, and collects smog for his paintings.He gets it from several meters above ground, from clean surfaces like marble, plastic and stone, using damp pieces of cotton.Then he applies the smog directly onto a cloth and creates street scenes and reproductions of the very buildings from which he got the dangerous material.Finally, he seals his paintings with a natural resin . His actions helped win a small victory for the people of Florence, as in October 25, 2012 the Duomo area of the city was made pedestrian-only.But there is still a long way to go, the artist believes, and only cleaning the thick layer of smog that has accumulated throughout Florence would take several years.Still, he continues to paint his unique smog artworks and let the people know how polluted the environment they live in really is."

What is Wei Guihong's attitudes towards her students' going abroad for their studies? _ .	"More college graduates in China are seeking for work experience instead of advanced degrees, a survey shows. The practical approach, coupled with a record number of students graduating from college, is expected to strengthen competition in the job market, analysts said. More than 76 percent of university students said they wanted to work after earning their degrees this summer, up from 68.5 percent in 2012 and 73.6 percent last year, according to poll results from Zhaopin.com, a major online agency, Zhu Bo. The annual survey also shows that about 20 percent university graduates chose to further education after graduation, while about 3 percent wanted to start their own businesses. Zeng Hao ,a 25-year-old media major, managed to land a job in a publishing company in Zhongshan, Guangdong province, before he received his master's degree from the University of Macau in June. "" Work experience really matters in the publishing industry"" he said. Wei Guihong , a program administrator at Nanjing University, said about 60 percent of the school's graduates entered the labor market every year. ""More and more students majoring in a foreign language choose to go abroad to continue their studies to improve their language skills,"" she said continuously, ""That's perhaps a bright future."" Liu Junsheng , a researcher at the Labor and Wage Institute of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, believes that economic conditions play a vital role in shaping college graduates' choices .""There were fewer job opportunities in the market. "" he said. ""Although academic degrees still matter, more and more employers value job seekers' work experience."" he said. The Zhaopin.com survey shows that each of the graduates sent resumes on average to about 28 potential employers and received five interview opportunities."	['Supportive']
Which statement will the author probably agree with?	"A bargain is something offered at a low and advantageous price. A more recent definition is: a bargain is a dirty trick to force money out of the pockets of silly and innocent people. The cost of producing a new - for example - toothpaste would make 80p the proper price for it, so we will market it at PS1.20. It is not a bad toothpaste, and as people like to try new things it will sell well to start with; but the attraction of _ soon fades, so sales will fall. When that happens we will reduce the price to PS1.15. And we will turn it into a bargain by printing 5p OFF all over it. Sometimes it is not 5p OFF but 1p OFF. What breathtaking rudeness to advertise 1p OFF your soap or washing powder or whatever! Even the poorest old-age pensioner ought to regard this as an insult , but he doesn't. A bargain must not be missed. People say one has to have washing powder (or whatever) and one might as well buy it a penny cheaper. The real danger starts when unnecessary things become 'bargains'. Many people just cannot resist bargains. Provided they think they are getting a bargain they will buy clothes they will never wear or furniture they have no space for. Once I heard of a man who bought an electric saw as a bargain and cut off two of his fingers the next day. But he had no regrets: the saw had been truly cheap. Quite a few people actually believe that they make money on such bargains. A lady once told me: ""I've had a lucky day today. I bought a dress for PS120, reduced from PS400; and I bought a beautiful Persian carpet for PS600, reduced from PS900."" It will never occur to her that she has actually wasted PS720. She feels as though she had made PS580. She also feels, I am sure, that if she had more time for shopping, she could make a living out of it. Some people buy in large quantities because it is cheaper. Once a couple bought enough sugar for their lifetime and the lifetime of their children and grandchildren. They thought it a bargain not to be missed. When the sugar arrived they didn't know where to store it - until they realized that their toilet was a very spacious one. So that was where they piled up their sugar. Not only did their guests feel rather strange whenever they were offered sugar to put into their coffee, but the toilet became extremely sticky. To offer bargains is a commercial trick to make the poor poorer. When greedy fools fall for this trick, it serves them right."	['Bargains play tricks on people.']
What does the writer mainly try to tell us in the reading?	"Bad teeth, a heavier body? And now, weaker bones. Last week, American scientists found another bad thing about cola: It's bad for our bones, especially women's bones. Well, if cola is bad for us, you may want other popular drinks , for example, energy drinks . Energy drinks look cool. Their makers say they give you energy and make you better at sports. So, many students drink them before exams to help them stay awake. But wait. To keep you awake, most energy drinks have a lot of caffeine . They are like a strong cup of coffee or tea. If you drink a lot of them, your heart will beat faster. You will feel nervous . You could also have sleeping problems and find it hard to live without them. Amanda Smith is a 16-year-old US junior high school student. She drinks one or more energy drinks every day. She started to do this a year ago before dance class. But now, Smith says, ""I drink them whenever I feel weak or before a test. I cannot help drinking them."" The energy you get from the drinks helps for only a short time. You may feel good for an hour or so, but then you'll feel worse than before."	['Be careful of unhealthy drinks.']
What is the author's purpose in writing the article?	"Every September in China, people love to talk about the overprotective parents following their children around everywhere during university enrollment. Now, with more than 420,000 youngsters in the UK starting their new college school year, what is their first day like? BBC's Sean Coughlan described it in a recent report. According to Coughlan, at the very beginning it is not hard to spot something familiar to Chinese-a stream of parents arriving with their sons and daughters at the student village. Mothers, fathers and a teenager-now most likely taller than they are - stand together like the three might have done on the first day of primary school. ""The approach road to the student village is a long traffic jam of family cars, stuffed full with boxes, pillows and nervous families,"" he writes. ""The door closes on a student's room and parents and children go their separate ways. For many families, if childhood has a final moment, this is it."" But saying goodbye to parents is not the only similarity between college freshmen in the UK and China. In both cases, new arrivals most want to know about their Internet connections. ""It's their most urgent concern,"" notes Coughlan. Even on their first day, university in the UK won't be an entirely lonely experience for some new students. ""Before they arrive they have been using social networking to get to know their future roommates,"" writes Coughlan. Still, the first night is something no UK university student ever forgets. There are people they meet and then spend three years avoiding and people who become their friends for the rest of their lives. First week stories are all about over-partying, bad cooking and misguided clothing, Coughlan says. As he concludes: ""These new students are entering their own soap opera of romance, friendship and ambition. It's a huge adventure that they've worked for years to achieve."""

The passage mainly tells us _ .	The westerners have more vacation days than us. Some people like to stay at home during their vacation. They work in the garden, visit their friends, read books or watch television. Many families take their lunch to a park or somewhere far from the city. They like to eat under some trees or near a nice lake. If they live near the sea, they often go to the seaside. There they can fish, swim or enjoy the sun. The westerners like travelling. They think travelling and outdoor activities are the parts of their lives. They work hard to save money, but their main purpose is to travel. Most western students often make use of their vacation to camp. There are thousands of camp interesting bases in western countries. They can swim, go fishing, attend lectures, and take part in many other recreational activities there. It can help them wrest from the secrets of nature, train their viability , and teach them how to be self-reliant .	['how the westerners spend their vacation']
According to the text, John was a man _ .	"My 8-year-old daughter is making an experiment. She has been making her own colorful smile cards and often takes them with her everywhere. Last Sunday, I took my kid to go shopping with me. She was hoping to see John, who is an elderly man and gives out samples. We see him from time to time and he is so happy and friendly. John wasn't at the store on Sunday, so my daughter decided that it would be a good idea to _ her smile cards to the store's other employees. So she did. In the produce department, she gave a card to a young man and she hoped it would make him smile. And he smiled at her and thanked her. Then she came across an older gentleman who looked rather impatient. And she snuck a card into his cart on top of his groceries, remarking to me later that he looked at her suspiciously as if she was dumping trash in his cart. But I thought he would be happy later. When we got back from our shopping trip, she had run out of cards. She was walking by a woman with two babies in her cart. My daughter smiled at her and the young mother smiled back. My daughter came to me and said excitedly, ""Mom, I just realized something. You don't need cards to make someone smile. All you need to do is make eye contact and smile into their eyes and they will smile back."" What a beautiful lesson my daughter reminded me of. You are never too young or too old to experiment with kindness and smiles."	['who may be a salesman']

How can people benefit from the first plan mentioned in the passage?	"When she graduates from Columbia University next year with a master's degree in Public health, Eric Wheeler is hoping to get a job in international reproductive health. The 26-year-old post-graduate has always wanted to work in public service. But public service doesn't pay much, and her two-year program at Columbia costs about $50,000 a year with living expenses. She has a scholarship from Columbia that covers just $4,000 a year and has taken out loans to pay for the rest. She worries that she will spend years paying back her student loans and not have money left over to put away in an IRA. Wheeler is wondering what she can do to ease the pain of being in debt. Is there anything she can do to handle the debt? The good news is that in 2007, Congress recognized that there were so many students in Wheeler's position that it passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. There were two programs established by this act that Wheeler should look into. The first is the income-based repayment plan, which allows lower-income graduates with a lot of debt to reduce their monthly payments. Depending on a graduate's income and level of debt, the program, which goes into effect July 1, could limit his or her annual educational loan debt repayment to 15 percent of discretionary income ,said Peter Mazareas, vice charman of the College Saving Foundation. The second is the public service loan forgiveness plan, in which the federal government will forgive the remaining debt of borrowers who make 10-year loan payment while working full time in public-service jobs. But the graduate must have a certain loan which is listed in the plan. Depending on the level of debt Wheeler ends up with and how much she repays over 10 years, Mazareas said she could end up with about $75,000 of her debt forgiven. "" Tipically, it is projected that a borrower who performs public service under this program will repay only about one-fourth to one-half as much money as a borrower who does not"", he said. He also pointed out that public service is broadly defined and includes any government and nonprofit organization job."	['People will have more time to pay back the debt.']
What kind of movies make people cry and frightened ?	There are many kinds of movies in the world. For example: comedies, scary movies, documentaries , soap operas, action movies...

What did a few lucky fishermen find when they return? _	The Sir Lankan coastline is filled with fishermen who use the sea as their main source of living. Their daily catch would define the life of their own and their families. But it only took a few hours to remove their life-long habitat right in front of their eyes. Some fishermen had set sail on Christmas night. A very few were lucky enough to return the next morning. But none found any of what they left behind the other night. They were made to lose their families by the very waters that they used to love the most. The few who made it through the day have been wondering about the meaning of their lives. They had used the sea for decades, but the sea used them for a single day. Is it justice ? Or killing? What would become of them? For whom would they go fishing again? As they struggle with their conflicting feelings, they also come to remind themselves of their struggle for survival. Where are they now? They didn't leave the beach, or the sea. They will be back because the sea is their home and the only means of living, so they will continue in their fight for destiny . But will it be the same? Sadly not. Even though they force themselves to forgive, they can't forget. They will never be able to get through the idea of _ turning against them. That fear would always run deep in their hearts. As the fishermen get ready to take on their duties once again, each would take with them a frightful story that reminds them of the day of betrayal , the day that rewrote their lives.

We can have more choices _ .	It's a goal for millions and millions of families every year----keep the Christmas spending within a certain amount, but can still afford the gifts that your loved ones will enjoy. Never has this concern been greater in recent years than right now. Even so, there are several things that you can do to help. Hit the sales. No one wants to get up at four o'clock in the morning and fight to get the best deal on Black Friday, and it's surely very tough to pick up the courage and get out there in the cold for a good deal, but sometimes----it can be well worth. Many retailers offer _ all through the day----and some even offer online Black Friday specials, so you may still be able to get a great deal on Black Friday. Pay close attention to advertisements. Once the Christmas shopping season is coming, retailers hungry for business will do just about whatever to get you in the store. Pay very close attention to weekly advertisements of sales among the major retailers and you may be lucky enough to find different prices for the same thing in different shops. Shop online. Some of us don't like running from store to store in order to get the best price on the perfect gift, and some of us don't like to go out in the cold at all----thankfully for us, we can do online shopping. The world of online shopping lets people visit all the major retailers as well as some specialty stores that could only be found on the Internet. Customers can find exactly what they are looking for, at the best possible price without ever having to leave the house. With traditional Christmas shopping consumers are sometimes limited to what's left in stock if they wait too long to get to a particular store.	['on the Internet']
What did the writer do at the age of 59?	"The following are some tips for becoming a successful businessman by Michael Bloomberg. They are based on his experience of building a company from the ground up, leading New York City as mayor , and so on. Take Risks Life is too short to spend your time avoiding failure. In 1981, at the age of 39, I lost my job. The next day I took a big risk and began my own company. In 2001, when I was debating whether to run for mayor, most people advised me not to do it. But one person said, ""If you can imagine yourself giving a concession speech, then why not go for it?"" That was the best advice I received, and I followed it. In order to succeed, you must first be willing to fail-- and you must have the courage to go for it anyway. Make your own luck Luck plays a part in success. The harder you work, the luckier you get. Whatever you choose to do, even if it's not the job of your dreams, always work hard at it. Be the first person at work in the morning and the last to leave at night. Hard work creates chances. Never stop learning The most powerful word in English language is ""why"". There is nothing so powerful as an open, inquiring mind . Whatever field you choose for starting a business -- be a lifelong student. Give back You are responsible for your success and failure, but you only succeed if you share the reward with others. My first donation was a $ 5 check to my alma mater . And while the checks may be bigger today, they come with the same spirit. You don't have to be wealthy to give back. You can give back by giving your time and talents."	['Ran for mayor.']
Which of the following best reflects the main idea of the passage?	"I remember a day when I was a little kid. I was making a sandwich in the kitchen when I noticed the date on one of the wine bottles. "" Dad, dad!"" I cried. ""This wine is too old to drink."" "" Son, hold on,"" he said. "" No, you can't drink this tonight! This bottle of wine was made 10 years ago."" "" Wait, let me tell you..."" "" Would you like me to throw it away fro you?"" I asked. "" Son, wait a second,"" he said. ""Son, some wines get better over time. The longer you wait to drink it, the better it will be. Although this may seem strange, it is true."" When I was young, I didn't have any understanding of what this meant, but now, this would have been very helpful to remember as I went through my teenage years. In our society, we forget this simple rule: The longer you want for certain things, the better they will be. But we want the best job as quickly as possible; we want to graduate from college in as few years as possible; we even speed through our homework just to chat with friends. When we do this, we lose something of great importance. We all want to get to the next step so quickly that perhaps we don't get ready enough to get there. This has a negative effect on our society. When trying to go to the right college, we will do anything to get in and when we rush through our class-work, we may not study enough for the test, and end up failing. We need to be ready for whatever comes, ready for the unexpected. Wine gets better over time, so do the things in our paths of life."	['More haste, less speed.']

It was difficult to drive in Bangkok in the past because _ .	When you are traveling in Thailand,which means of transport is the best choice? You can rent a variety of motorbikes or bikes in Thailand.It seems to be very popular in most of the beaches and islands along the places in the north.The most popular bikes are the little 125 cc Honda Dream which you can get for about 150 baht a day or as little as 3,000 baht per month,making it the cheapest way to tour Thailand for the people from other countries. Sometimes you will have to go somewhere by taxi.When you are in cities in Thailand,especially in Bangkok,always remember to get a taxi that is going on the roads.Some drivers outside hotels refuse to use the milometer .They will ask a price which is several times the price when they use the meter! The quality of the roads in Thailand is generally pretty good,so renting cars is another way to get around.The big car rental companies may offer you slightly older cars at a very reasonable price.It is a little surprising considering that the cost of buying a car in Thailand is more than that in the West.Petrol is also reasonably priced in Thailand,more expensive than American prices,but much cheaper than what is paid in Europe.In the past,Bangkok could be a difficult place to drive in--signs were generally in Thai only,making it a hard job to find exactly where you were by looking around.But now,the situation is improved.In a lot of places,even the farthest corners of the country,street signs are in both Thai and English.

But it comes up for air. The blue whale is the world's biggest animal. There are other sea animals, too. One is called the dolphin. Dolphins need air to live. They breathe air, as whales do. Dolphins are very clever. They sometimes seem to speak to each other. Many other animals live near the sea. Seals and otters love the sea. They swim and play there. They eat fish and sea plants.

How many people traveled abroad in 2012?	"In September 2013, the China National Tourism Administration issued a new set of tourist guideline in order to improve tourists' behavior when they travel abroad. Although the 64-page handbook contains suggestions for Chinese tourists when traveling at home, the main purpose is to improve the poor reputation of Chinese tourists abroad. In 2013, more than 83 million Chinese people traveled overseas, up 18 percent from the year 2012, according to the China Tourism Academy. But even as they travel farther, the Chinese tourists continue to take bad habits with them. From damaging ancient Egyptian temples to letting children defecate in the middle of airports, Chinese tourists have earned a bad fame. Chinese Vice-Premier Wang Yang even stressed the need for Chinese tourists to behave better while traveling overseas so as to protect China's image abroad. Now with the latest ""guidebook"", Chinese travelers should have no excuse for rude behavior. According to the guidelines, when using the restroom, Chinese tourists are asked not to forget to flush the toilet after using it. The guidelines also remind tourists of not fighting with others when they want to take pictures at tourist attractions. When flying, the guidelines advise travelers not to take life vests away from airplanes. Chinese tourists are also encouraged to be respectful of local customs wherever they travel. In the United Kingdom, for example, it is not polite to ask people. Where are you going?"" or ""Have you eaten?"", the handbook says. Nevertheless, with a very short history of traveling overseas, it is not surprising that many Chinese tourists behave badly on their foreign trips. We should give them time to change. ,."

Why are Denise and Marcia mentioned in the text?	"Rome had the Forum . London has Speaker's Corner. Now always-on-the-go New Yorkers have Liz and Bill.

What is the best title for the passage?	"There was once a rabbit who thought the more friends she had, the better. So she made many friends. She even thought she was the most popular animal in the world. One day the rabbit heard hounds baying not far from her. Usually, she hurried away at the first sound of a baying dog. But this time she didn't want to run for her life as before. ""I have so many friends, and they could help me,"" she thought. She decided to ask one of them to carry her to safety. The rabbit asked the horse, ""Please, dear friend, will you carry me away from the hounds?"" The horse answered, ""I wish I could help you, but I have work to do for my owner."" Then the rabbit asked the cow for help. The cow answered, ""I wish I could help you, but it's almost milking time."" The goat had something important to do, too. So were the sheep and the pig. Every animal the rabbit asked for help seemed to be _ . Even the calf had no time for her. Each of her friends said, ""I wish I could help you.""

By this time, the hounds were getting closer. The rabbit didn't have any time to think. She was forced to run for her life. She quickly took off and, luckily, escaped just in time."

The reason why the imported book is so popular is that _ .	"The publication of ""Harry Potterandthe Half-Blood Prince"" gladdens booksellers across China. The British and American editions were No. 1 and No. 3 respectively on the sales chart of the Beijing Xidan Book Building last week. The book's poster is highlighted and news about the book can often be heard on the radio. Why is the book so attractive to children? With curious mood, the author got a copy of ""Harry Potter"". Originally, I wanted to glance over it and made some criticisms. But, out of expectation, the author has been deeply attracted by the magic world. On the other hand, one cannot help asking: _ Harry Potter""? The Chinese nation has a history of 5, 000 years, which cannot be regarded as short and its culture as not profound. With a vast market of youngsters, China did publish many books popular among children. However, why are the present works not as good as those imported? There come two major reasons: Firstly, quite a number of children's books are of strong sense of teaching, and lack interest and entertainment. Children often have a feeling of being ""educated"". No wonder they don't like them. Secondly, children's reading materials involving ""idiom stories"" and ""Chinese talents' stories"", though always in different covers, are usually much the same or plagiarized . One knows the ending as early as in the beginning. In final analysis, the authors of the books seldom take children's requirements into consideration. As a matter of fact, each child has his own wonderful imagination. They long to understand the world and nature. Similarly they have their own choices. They dislike similar stories, even if the stories are excellent. First-class reading for children should be very interesting, which contains knowledge and the essence of national culture, which are presented in children's language. Market is a touchstone for products. The theory also holds true for cultural products. It is hoped that the authors of children's books can learn something from the good market of ""Harry Potter"" and write out more and better books loved by children."

Where does the quality of genius come from? Is it all in the genes or can any child be turned into a genius? And if parents do have a child who might become a genius in the future, what should they do ? In this 30-minute film, Barry Johnson, the professor at School of Medicine, New York University will help you discover the answer. 10:00 PM Science/Health Is it possible to beat high blood pressure without drugs? The answer is ""yes"", according to the researchers at Johns Hopkins and three other medical centers. After a study of 800 persons with high blood pressure, they found that after 6 months, those devoted to weight-loss exercise and eating a low-salt, low-fat food lost about 13 pounds and became fitter. Plus, 35% of them dropped into the ""normal"" category. This week, Dr. Alan Duckworth will tell you how these people reduce their blood pressure to a level similar to what's achieved with Hypertension drugs."	['famous stars']
What would be the best title for this passage?	My passion started decades ago as a kid on a flight to India. I was attracted by how such a large airplane was able to glide smoothly above the clouds. I made it a goal to become a pilot. I am now a pilot for American airlines. Though being a pilot consumes my life,it is a job worth doing. My job is slightly different compared to that of a typical pilot. Most pilots have their routes they fly. They then familiarize(...)themselves with the routes. However, in my case,I participate in any job where a pilot is immediately required. It is true that some days I might have a workday from nine in the morning to five in the afternoon. In fact,some days,I might even begin my work at three in the morning when I am needed to fly. Sometimes, as for the typical day,I do not have one. Having been on the job for over two decades,I have learned some important life lessons. As I greet passengers boarding the airplane,I realize I,along with other airline pilots, have enhanced the lives of those who we are serving. In fact, there is one particular experience that I will never forget. A family was walking in from the gate, explaining that their beloved one was ill and had to be taken to a big hospital in another city immediately. It was at this point that I realized just how important my job was. Therefore, my life as an airline pilot is definitely not for everyone. However,my job is something I enjoy thoroughly and will continue to do till I am old enough. As a pilot, I have been able to experience so many different types of situations in different places throughout the world. For anyone interested in piloting, I would recommend going for it.

Who's an assistant leader in the passage?	"Parent fans, both dads and mums, are shaming British football with their bad behaviour. Hundreds of junior soccer matches had to be abandoned last season because parent fans were swearing or even fighting on the touchline. At schools and clubs across the UK, hundreds of more matches also had to be called off for the same reason. Reports tell of abuse at referees , players and coaches and fight breaking out on the touchline. Enough is enough Peter Wright, a keen referee of junior soccer, finally hung up his boots last season. He decided to walk away for good. He said ""Every week I have had to take abuse and I've had enough of it."" ""Parents' behaviour is reducing many school teachers, referees, coaches and volunteers to despair."" The kids are suffering Jim Peter, a referee, said, ""We are getting desperate and the kids are suffering."" He described the way spectators behave as and getting worse year by year. The big question is why so many parents shame their children in this way. Aggressive Behavior Contracts may have to be introduced to stop the violence and abuse. If not, the game will suffer. Sign up to good conduct Last season players and parents were made to sign a new good behavior contract. ""If a parent breaks the contract, I take his or her child off the pitch and get him or her to explain why I have done so to the child,"" said Marc Nash, Wallsend's assistant leader. ""The next step is to ban both the parent and the child, but happily, so far this has not been necessary."""	['Marc Nash.']
We can know from the passage that Mr Obama _ .	"President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama ended their first trip to India on Monday. The First Couple set off on the ten-day tour of Asia on Friday. Obama's goals for the tour are to improve ties between the US and the region, and to promote economic growth and job creation. The President and his team will return to Washington, D.C. on November 14. The Obamas began their trip in Mumbai, India, the financial and economic center of the country, on November 6. There, they met with government officials, business leaders and school groups. Up first on the schedule was a visit to a memorial at the TajMahal Palace and Tower Hotel. Obama's second day in India was lighter than the first. The Presidential visit took place on Diwali, or the Festival of Lights. The five-day religious festival is celebrated each year by Hindus, Sikhs and others. The Obamas spent the holiday visiting with local schoolchildren. On Monday, Michelle Obama joined 15 Indian school girls on a field trip to a museum of Indian craft work. During the tour, the First Lady stressed to the students the importance of education. Most of the children on the trip are the first girls in their families to attend school. Mrs Obama also encouraged the young women to stay fit, telling them that she likes to exercise because ""women have to stay strong"". Early tomorrow, the Obamas will travel to Indonesia, the country in which the President spent four years as a boy. After that, they will fly to Seoul, South Korea, to attend the Group of Twenty, or G-20, economic summit. The conference brings together leaders from 20 wealthy and developing nations and the European Union. They meet twice a year to address challenges that affect the global economy. The final leg of the tour will be in Japan, where Obama will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit."	['will attend an important conference in Seoul']
Which of the following is TRUEaccording to the passage?	All the 6,000 medals for the 2008 Olympic Games have arrived in the capital from the Shanhai Mint,ready for their debut on August 8.For the,first time in Olympic history,the medals for the Beijing Games mix metal and jade. The technology of inlaying jade into metal can date back to the Han Dynasty almost 2,000 years ago.It is not easy to bond jade perfectly with metal.The key to the process lies in the inner layer of the metal and the groove of the jade ring.A seal ring is put between the inner layer and the groove to join the metal and jade together. Jade rings used for casting Olympic medals have been subjected to strict quality controls,and those not up to the standard have been thrown away. To make use of those jade rings that do meet the quality criteria,metal medals were produced to fit the jade tings,and more than ten different sizes of seal rings were designed. To avoiding any loosening of the jade rings due to aging of the seals,glue has been used in casting the;Olympic medals,which is a painstaking manual process. Experts from the International Olympic Committee(IOC)were concerned about the risk of fragility when the jade ring design was proposed.The IOC required that jade rings should be strong enough to withstand a 2-meter drop test.The Shanghai Mint raised that standard to 3- meters.Medals call survive a 3-meter drop test with only minor cracks on the jade rings.

Babbage failed to continue his research work in 1828 mainly because _ .	"When Babbage was working atprefix = st1 /Cambridge, a new idea occurred to him. He wanted to construct a calculating machine to work out the solutions to maths problems not only with correctness but also with a speed beyond the power of any human mind. His machine could solve problems involving long rows of figures in one continuous operation . In 1822 Babbage exhibited his invention and won a prize from the government. After that, he immediately started to work on a larger machine designed to solve more difficult problems. Although he received some money left by his father, the money was not enough to support his design. He wrote to the government about his plan and was givenPS2500 to start with, a sum worth much more in those days than it is now. Babbage continued his work inLondonfor four years. Then his health broke down, and he had to take a long holiday abroad. When he returned toLondonin 1828, he was at the end of his resources. Many bills remained unpaid. His chief assistant and co-workers quarreled with him and left with many expensive tools. For one year no work was done. During this period, Babbage, whose mind was always active, suddenly thought of a completely new idea for the machine. He rushed to meet the government officials to explain his new idea. But this time, they were unwilling to help him. For eight years, they refused to say whether they wanted the machine or not, and their final answer was ""No."" From 1828 to 1839, Babbage held the position of professor atCambridgevery successfully. But his greatest work was the unfinished calculating machine which stood covered in dust in his house. It was the beginning of the modern computer."	['he almost ran out of money']
What is the real meaning of the doctor's words?	"The most common disease in the world is the cold. It often starts with a sore throat . You sneeze and your nose runs. You usually have a headache, too. Often you have a cough later. It's not a serious disease, but you can feel quite bad. There isn't a cure for a cold, but you can take some medicine to make you feel better. For example, you can take aspirin to get rid of your headache. It is good to rest. and to drink a lot of water, too. A doctor once told me.""With the right medicine. a cold will last for seven days. With no medicine, it will go on for a whole week!"" A long time ago, people understood that some plants made them feel better. For example, the juice of lemons makes a sore throat feel better. In modern times, scientists have found out which chemicals are in them. Man, of our medicines today are made from those chemicals. There are some diseases that we can't cure yet. And nobody has found a cure for old age. But because of modern medicines, the average people now live longer than their grandparents."	['There is almost no medicine that can cure the cold.']

According to the author, which of the following statements is WRONG?	"""Why should I care about the environment?"" some people ask. There is a very simple reason: We live on the earth, and it is the only place we can live on right now, as we cannot live in space yet. If we treat the earth like a garbage dump, it will become dirty and unlivable. If we treat it well by being eco-conscious, the earth will stay clean and suitable for living, for ourselves and for our children. What is ""being eco-conscious""? Being eco-conscious means being aware of your actions, and what you do to the environment. For example, you might think, ""Using hairspray is great for fixing my hair."" However, if you are eco-conscious, you would ask, ""Does this hairspray have CFCs in it? Could I be destroying the earth by using hairspray?"" How can I be eco-conscious? You can find many simple ways to help the environment in your everyday life. When you go shopping, bring a bag or a basket with you. Please try not to use plastic bags as much as you can. You can go to work by bike or on foot if it is not far from your home. You can put your rubbish into different bags, which makes it convenient for recycling. You can eat less chewing gum. You can use your own chopsticks instead of the disposable ones in your company or in restaurants. You can put batteries in a special box instead of in garbage bins. You can use the water which has been used for washing vegetables or fruits to clean the floor and the toilet or to water your garden. You can turn off the decorative lights in your room when watching TV. You can turn down your air conditioner by one degree, as this will cause a 10% reduction in energy use. You can use recycled paper. Every ton of recycled office paper saves 380 gallons of oil. You can also use recycled glass instead of glass made from raw materials. This will reduce the related air pollution by 20%, and the related water pollution by 50%. Please believe that. If you do a little, it will make a big difference."

The news mentioned in the very beginning is intended to _ .	"The news that China bans time-travel TV dramas and movies got a lot of attention on the internet. Yet, time travel in China is a bit different from time travel in common sense.It is anything but science fiction and always goes backwards in time.There is minimum imagination involved--no ever-ending circles that mess up present and future, no advanced technology, no new social orders or new human forms from the twenty--whatever century, everything is a known historical fact when you travel through in China. It is not even called time travel; rather the Chinese people refer it as time crossover.Time crossover has been an extremely popular theme for online novels for years(in fact , it is an indispensible part of China's online culture), and didn't get picked up by TV and the big screen until recent two years.Most of time-travel dramas and movies are adapted from popular online novels and like in other cases adaptations are never better than the original books. The main plot of time-travel novels or TV dramas can be very well summarized in one sentence: from nobody to somebody.Time travel in China is more about escaping from the reality than about realizing wild dreams. In China , there is no need of time machine either.People travel backwards in time via the possession of antiques presence at historical places of interest encounter of life-threatening accidents or simple a look into the mirror.Some time-travel novels even start with ""I wanted to go back to history so much that one morning when I opened my eyes I was back."" Technology is not relevant at all. Though China is not short of histories to go back to, people have their own preferences and it is pretty much a gender thing.If the main character is male then he usually goes back to special times in history when he is able to help build up or tear up a dynasty.A typical example is A Step Into the Past , the first time-travel TV drama in China, which tells the story of how a SWAT member helps to unite China and build up Qin Dynasty . On the other hand , female characters primarily go back to Qing Dynasty partly because Qing Dynasty has the most number of princes to fall in love with.Yongzheng Emperor is the favorite.As can be seen in Startling by Each Step , a Qing time crossover classic, a girl goes back to Qing Dynasty and falls in love with Yongzheng Emperor and his brothers."

What does the text mainly convey?	"Almost everyone stood when the bride walked down the aisle in her white dress,but not the wedding conductor,because she was fixed on her chair.

From the passage, we know that the author is _ .	At the beginning of the World Series of 1947, I experienced a completely new emotion, when the National Anthem was played. This time, I thought, it is being played for me, as much as for anyone else. This is organized major league baseball, and I am standing here with all the others; and everything that takes place includes me. About a year later, I went to Atlanta, Georgia, to play in an exhibition game. On the field, for the first time in Atlanta, there were Negroes and whites. Other Negroes besides me. And I thought: What I have always believed has come to be. And what is it that I have always believed? First, those imperfections are human. But that wherever human beings were given room to breathe and time to think, those imperfections would disappear, no matter how slowly. I do not believe that we have found or even approached perfection. That is not necessarily in the scheme of human events. Handicaps, stumbling blocks, prejudices -- all of these are imperfect. Yet, they have to be dealt with because they are in the scheme of human events. Whatever obstacles I found made me fight all the harder. But it would have been impossible for me to fight at all, except that I was sustained by the personal and deep-rooted belief that my fight had a chance. It had a chance because it took place in a free society. Not once was I forced to face and fight an immovable object. Not once was the situation so cast-iron rigid that I had no chance at all. Free minds and human hearts were at work all around me; and so there was the probability of improvement. I look at my children now, and know that I must still prepare them to meet obstacles and prejudices. But I can tell them, too, that they will never face some of these prejudices because other people have gone before them. And to myself I can say that, because progress is unalterable, many of today's dogmas will have vanished by the time they grow into adults. I can say to my children: There is a chance for you. No guarantee, but a chance. And this chance has come to be, because there is nothing static with free people. There is no Middle Ages logic so strong that it can stop the human tide from flowing forward. I do not believe that every person, in every walk of life, can succeed in spite of any handicap. That would be perfection. But I do believe -- and with every fiber in me -- that what I was able to attain came to be because we put behind us (no matter how slowly) the dogmas of the past: to discover the truth of today; and perhaps find the greatness of tomorrow. I believe in the human race. I believe in the warm heart. I believe in man's honesty. I believe in the goodness of a free society. And I believe that the society can remain good only as long as we are willing to fight for it -- and to fight against whatever imperfections may exist. My fight was against the barriers that kept Negroes out of baseball. This was the area where I found imperfection, and where I was best able to fight. And I fought because I knew it was not doomed to be a losing fight. It couldn't be a losing fight--not when it took place in a free society. And in the largest sense, I believe that what I did was done for me -- that it was my faith in God that sustained me in my fight. And that what was done for me must and will be done for others.

Which of the following statements is NOT against Bowlby's theory?	"The British psychoanalyst John Bowlby maintains that separation from the parents during the sensitive ""attachment"" period from birth to three may scar a child's personality and lead to emotional problems in later life. Some people have drawn the conclusion from Bowlby's work that children should not be subjected to day care before the age of three because of the parental separation it causes, and many people do believe this. But there are also arguments against such a strong conclusion. Firstly, anthropologists point out that the insulated love affair between children and parents found in modern societies does not usually exist in traditional societies. For example, in some tribal societies, such as the Ngoni, the father and mother of a child did not bring up their infant alone - far from it. Secondly, common sense tells us that day care would not be so widespread today if parents, care-takers found children had problems with it. Statistical studies of this kind have not yet been carried out, and even if they were, the results would be certain to be complicated and controversial. Thirdly, in the last decade, there have been a number of careful American studies of children in day care, and they have uniformly reported that day care had a neutral or slightly positive effect on children's development. But tests that have had to be used to measure this development are not widely enough accepted to settle the issue. But Bowlby's analysis raises the possibility that early day care has delayed effects. The possibility that such care might lead to, say, more mental illness or crime 15 or 20 years later can only be explored by the use of statistics. Whatever the long-term effects, parents sometimes find the immediate effects difficult to deal with. Children under three are likely to protest at leaving their parents and show unhappiness. At the age of three or three and a half almost all children find the transition to nursery easy, and this is undoubtedly why more and more parents make use of child care at this time. The matter, then, is far from clear-cut, though experience and available evidence indicate that early care is reasonable for infants."

What can we conclude from the difference between a skeptic and a cynic?	"Every day from the time we wake up until the time we go to bed, we are bombarded with information from all sides, from TV, radio, newspapers and books; from family, friends, and colleagues. As a new cable television subscriber, I am ly amazed at the quantity and varying levels of information quality on cable television. Including the networks, there are eight TV ""news"" organizations vying to provide us with all the information we can possibly absorb. Newspaper, magazines, books, radio, the Internet, email, snail mail, and the telephone all compete for our attention and our minds. At the office conversations around the water cooler and coffee maker serve to spread even more items of information. There is valuable information out there about the world we live in, on topics as varied as health, safety, traffic, nutrition, business, finance, philosophy, nature, science, weather, history and the human condition. There is also a large amount of misleading and outright false information, not just on controversial subjects such as politics and religion but on any topic one can think of, including all of the topics mentioned above. With all this information coming at us from all directions, how does one sift through it all to sort out the facts from the fiction, the truth from the lies, the more important from the less important? Should we turn off the TV, cancel our newspaper subscriptions, disconnect our phones and modems to become information ""hermits""? Probably not. A better method of sifting through the information wave without being overwhelmed and confused is to become a skeptical inquirer-or skeptic-with regard to the surrounding world. By ""skeptic""-I do not mean a cynic-a person who rejects new ideas simply because they are new. A skeptic is one who questions the validity of a particular claim by calling for evidence to prove or disprove it. Skepticism is a method, not a position. It is a provisional approach to all factual claims. In terms of processing information, a skeptic needs to be able to grasp reality and acquire knowledge about the environment that agrees with reason, logic, and evidence. In other words, as skeptics, when we hear a claim that may or may not be fantastic, we should say, ""That's nice, prove it."""

Which of these airports is out of business now?	One mile long runway can take people across the oceans, to reach every corner of the world. That's the magic power of airplanes as well as airports. Similar as most airports are, some do have their unique features. Lukla Airport Lukla Airport, is a small airport in the town of in the town of Lukla, eastern Nepal. A program titled Most Extreme Airports, rated the airport as the most dangerous airport in the world. The airport is popular because Lukla is the place where most people start the climb to Mount Everest Base Camp. High wind, cloud cover, and changing visibility often mean flights can be delayed or the airport closed. The airport's runway is accessible only to helicopters and small, fixed-wing, short-takeoff-and-landing aircraft. The runway is only 527m with an elevation of 2,845m. Princess Juliana International Airport Princess Juliana International Airport is in the country of Saint Maarten. The airport is perhaps best known for very low-altitude flyover landing approaches due to one end of its runway being extremely close to the shore and Maho Beach. The thrilling approaches and ease of access for shooting spectacular images make the airport one of the world's favorite places among plane spotters. Gibraltar Airport Gibraltar Airport serves the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, a tiny peninsula with an area of only 6.8 square kilometers. The lack of flat space there means the peninsula's only runway is bisected by its busiest road, the Winston Churchill Avenue that heads towards the land border with Spain. It is really scary that there is a four lane highway passing through the middle of the runway! Kai Tak Airport Kai Tak Airport was officially known as Hong Kong International Airport from 1954 to 6 July 1998, when it was closed and replaced by the new one at Chek Lap Kok, 30 kms to the west. With numerous skyscrapers and mountains located to the north and its only runway jutting out into Victoria Harbour, landing at the airport were dramatic to experience and technically demanding for pilots. The low altitude manoeuvre required to line up with the runway was so spectacular that some passengers claimed to have glimpsed the television through apartment windows along the final approach.

The scientists allowed the volunteers to keep their cell phones for a week in order to _ .	"Your cell phone holds secrets about you. Besides the names and numbers that you've programmed into it, traces of your DNA remain on it, according to a new study. DNA is genetic material that appears in every cell. Like your fingerprint, your DNA is unique to you --- unless you have an identical twin. Scientists today usually analyze DNA in blood,saliva , or hair left behind at the scene of a crime. The results often help detectives identify criminals and their victims. Meghan J. McFadden, a biologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, heard about a crime in which the suspect bled onto a cell phone and later dropped the device. This made her wonder whether traces of DNA remained on cell phones --- even when no blood was involved. To find out, she and a colleague collectedflip-style phones from 10 volunteers. They collected invisible traces of the users from two parts of the phone: the outside, where the user holds it, and the speaker, which is placed at the user's ear. The scientists scrubbed(meaning ""cleaned"") the phones using a liquid mixture made mostly of alcohol. The aim of washing was to remove all detectable traces of DNA. The owners got their phones back for another week. Then the researchers collected the phones and repeated collecting traces on each phone once more. They discovered DNA that belonged to the phone's owner on each of the phones. Surprisingly, DNA showed up even in swabs that were taken immediately after the phones were cleaned. That suggests that washing won't remove all traces of evidence from a criminal's cell phone. So cell phones can now be added to the list of clues that can help a crime-scene investigation."

According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?	"It was a beautiful summer afternoon. I happened to be at a local Walmart picking up some stuff for my wife when I laid my eyes on two young ladies. They were walking confidently, with their heads held high, which made me believe that they were involved in some kind of competitive sport. They were wearingT-shirts, at the back of which printed, ""Pain is temporary, but pride is forever."" Thinking of these words, I automatically said to myself, ""That's right! No pain, no gain."" Whatever is worth having is worth fighting for, and with fight, there comes pain! Fortunately, pain is just temporary. However, it is a necessary step you need to take to get your gain. Athletes and their coaches understand this so well. They spend so many hours and so much effort preparing for a competition. Some will think about giving up when the training is so painful, but coaches are there to remind them that ""quitters never win and winners never quit"".. So they know that when victory comes, they will be proud of themselves and that pride can last a lifetime. You've probably heard the saying, ""There's no such thing as a free lunch."" Well, it is true. Everything in life has a price, whether you agree or not. To want something for free will always lead to deception. Even if you get it, you will not value it or enjoy it, because it is free. No one has told you that life is easy! In fact it is a series of struggles and fights. You will achieve what other people call ""impossible"" only when you are willing to endure pain and overcome fear and doubt. Your achievement in life is in direct proportion to how much sacrifice you are willing to make. Successful people are usually and wrongly labeled as lucky or highly favored by circumstances. However, if you hear their personal stories, you will realize that they went through a lot of trials, but still kept on going, enduring the pain to make where they are today. If we understand that every effect has its cause, then we will grasp the fact that we do have a chance to influence the outcome we get in life."	['If you get something free, you will not treasure it.']
Which can be the best title of the passage?	"Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has been gathered around her since she was hospitalized on Saturday after being found unconscious in the bathtub of her suburban Atlanta townhome. Whitney Houston's only child is now at Emory University Hospital and is still fighting for her life, as a family statement said on Monday. Nothing has changed, despite reports that are popping up and painting a more serious picture. Fox News reported Wednesday that the situation is horrific. ""It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,"" a source told FOX411. ""They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive."" People Magazine is also reporting that a doctor told Brown's family on Wednesday that nothing more could be done. ""Everyone is coming to the hospital to say goodbye,"" said a family member. And the Daily Mail says Brown has been taken off life support. But Bobby Brown issued a statement late Thursday denying these reports. ""If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day. This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,"" he said, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. A source close to the family tells USA TODAY that it's wrong to say the family is gathering to say goodbye, because the family has been there since the beginning, so nothing is any different today for them. Also, Brown is ""not brain dead,"" as has been reported. And, as for other stories saying that the Houston family is feuding with Bobbi Kristina's dad, Bobby Brown? Those aren't true either. They ""are NOT fighting,"" says our source."	['False Reports From Different News Media']
Which of the following is TRUE?	"In many British schools, the pupils usually wear their school uniforms to school on weekdays.However, recently the students at LVS Ascot Junior School in England wore something quite different.What they wore was what people wear when they go to bed--pyjamas .They did this not only for fun, but for a local charity called Christopher's Smile. Christopher's Smile was set up in 2008 by Karen & Kevin Capel whose only son Christopher died of cancer at a young age.They hope their charity will help pay for more research into children's cancers.Since then, the charity has raised a lot of money and gotten more and more volunteers.Every year, thousands of people take part in different activities such as charity walk or run to show their support for Christopher's Smile. The students of Grade 6 at LVS Ascot Junior School also wanted to do something for the sick children.They organized the event ""Pyjamas Day"" to support Christopher's Smile.""We wanted to raise money for our charity in a way that the whole school could join in it, so each pupil paid PS1 to wear his or her pyjamas to school on Pyjamas Day,"" said the young organizers.Both the students and their teachers took part in the event with great interest.Together they not only raised some money, but also had a good time."	"[""It has been six years since Christopher's Smile was set up.""]"
Which is TRUE about memory according to the passage?	Language students often think they have memory problems. They worry because they can't remember words. In fact, the problem usually isn't with their memory. The problem is with how they study. To remember words better, you need to understand how memory works. There are two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. When you see, hear, or read something, it goes first into short-term memory. But short-term memory lasts for only a few seconds. You will only remember something longer if it goes into long-term memory. Y _ . How can you do this with vocabulary? The answer is to work with the word and think about the word in new ways. You can do this by writing new sentences that include it. Even better, you can invent a little story about the word, with people or places that you know. Another way is to make a picture in your mind with the word. For example, if the word is height, you can think of the tallest person you know and try to guess his or her height. All of these activities are good ways to think about words. They make the meaning of words stronger in your long-term memory. And they give a way to find a word when you need it.	['We will forget a word soon if it goes into short-term memory.']
We can learn from the passage that_in learning a foreign language.	"Here is a passage about learning a foreign language. Outside of class, the most natural way of finding out if you are making mistakes is from other people's responses. If the mistakes are too serious, your listeners will be asking you all the time what you mean. If they are not so serious, then people may be asking you whether you said such and such. That will tell you how close you are to speaking ""cogently"". Of course, there are other times when it is important to have errors pointed out. Your class assignments are probably marked in this way, in which case you need to spend time going over them to take advantage of the individual feedback. In some classes the teacher gets better and better at grammar because she does all the corrections, but the students make slow progress if, when an assignment is returned, they quickly stuff it into their folders without looking. You are the person who should be connecting your error, even if the marker has signaled them, when you look at them; there are some steps to work through. One distinction that has been made about learners' language is this. You make mistakes about rules that you already know but you make errors about points you haven't learned yet. In other words, you can find your own mistakes, but not your errors. First, make sure you understand what you have written or said, or your correction will simply be another stab at the right answer. Next, decide on the best way of practicing the correct form. Would it help you to write out the sentence once more? Can you make up another similar sentence? Then you could test yourself in a few days time to see whether you have remembered the right form, anyone can get it right immediately after being told. He challenge is to remember it and apply it later."	['getting and using responses is important']
From the passage, technology companies aim to _ .	"Everywhere I look outside my home I see people busy on their high-tech devices, while driving, walking, shopping, even sitting in toilets. When connected electronically, they are away from physical reality. People have been influenced to become technology addicted. One survey reported that ""addicted"" was the word most commonly used by people to describe their relationship to iPad and similar devices. One study found that people had a harder time resisting the _ of social media than they did for sleep, cigarettes and alcohol. The main goal of technology companies is to get people to spend more money and time on their products, not to actually improve our quality of life. They have successfully created a cultural disease. Consumers willingly give up their freedom, money and time to catch up on the latest information, to keep pace with their peers or to appear modern. I see people trapped in a pathological relationship with time-sucking technology, where they serve technology more than technology serves them. I call this technology servitude. I am referring to a loss of personal freedom and independence because of uncontrolled consumption of many kinds of devices that eat up time and money. What is a healthy use of technology devices? That is the vital question. Who is really in charge of my life? That is what people need to ask themselves if we are to have any chance of breaking up false beliefs about their use of technology. When we can live happily without using so much technology for a day or a week, then we can regain control and personal freedom, become the master of technology and discover what there is to enjoy in life free of technology. Mae West is famous for proclaiming the wisdom that ""too much of a good thing is wonderful."" But it's time to discover that it does not work for technology. Richard Fernandez, an executive coach at Google acknowledged that ""we can be swept away by our technologies."" To break the grand digital connection people must consider how life long ago could be fantastic without today's overused technology."	['attract people to buy their products']
Tony Burke put off announcing the koala as an endangered species because _ .	"Tony Burke, Australia's environment minister, says he won't decide until next year whether the koala should be protected as an endangered species. He was expected to make his decision by the end of October. But that decision has been put off. Burke said he needed more time to go over the latest information about the koala's population. In September, an Australian Senate committee reported that there was no question the koala's population is on the decrease. ""But they may not yet be eligible for listing as a threatened species,"" said Senator Doug Cameron. ""To have such a significant Australian icon included on the threatened species list would be a national shame."" The koala is found only in the eucalyptus forests of Australia. And its population is reported to have fallen sharply for many reasons, including the cutting down of forests to make way for human beings' development, their own illness, climate change and killings by other animals such as wild dogs. And every year many koalas are hit by cars as they are trying to cross the busy roads. Putting off the decision on protection for the koala ""is really bad news,"" said Debbie Pointing, the president of the Koala Action Group. ""We've worked tirelessly for many years to gather data on the populations,"" Pointing said. ""That data should be enough to make a decision."" However, Burke pointed out that the Australian government had spent at least $6.3 million on koala conservation efforts since 1996. senators listed efforts that are already underway in Queensland - the construction of special koala bridges as well as fences along roads, to keep the animals out of harm's way. Some people say that is not enough. ""What we're doing at the moment is likely to drive this species to extinction,"" Queensland University zoologist Bill Ellis said. ""Koalas are an iconic Australian animal,"" Burke told Australians. ""They hold a special place in the hearts of Australians."" But it is a fact that if more isn't done to protect the koala, they might soon hold a place only in Australians' memories."	['he needed more time to examine latest information']
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"There was a strange father, John Blake, from Michigan, who named his children after a computer software term. He told the local newspaper the US traditional way of adding ""Junior"" or ""II"" after a boy's name was too common. So, when his son was born last week, he decided on the name John Blake 2.0, as if he were a software programmer. Mr. Blake admitted that it took months to persuade his wife, Jamie, to accept the idea. Mrs. Blake said she asked several friends whether they could accept this name or not. ""All the men,"" she said, ""felt the name was cool."" However,her women friends did not think so. ""I think the women end up like it,""she said. Mr. Blake told the local newspaper he got the idea from a film called The Legend of 1900,in which an abandoned baby is given the name 1900 to remember the year of its birth. ""I thought that if they can do it , why can't we?"" he said. After little John version 2.0 was born, Mr. Blake even sent a celebratory e-mail to the family and friends, which was designed to look as if he and his wife had created a new software. ""I wrote things like there are a lot of new features from Version 1.0 with additional features from Jamie,"" he said. And he has already planned for his son's future. ""If he has a child, he could name it 3.0,"" he said."	"[""Mrs. Blake didn't agree to name her son after a computer software term at the very beginning.""]"

What is the writer's attitude toward her mother now?	"I had the unkindest mother in the whole world.While other kids ate candy for breakfast.I had to have cereal and eggs.When others had Cokes and candy for lunch,I had to eat a sandwich.But at least I wasn't alone.My sister and two brothers had the same unkind mother as I did. My mother knew where we were at all times.She knew who our friends were.We had to clean clothes and take a bath every day.We had to be in bed by 9:00 p.m.and up at 8:00 a.m. We couldn't sleep till noon like our friends.So while they slept,our mother gave us work to do.We had to wash dishes,make our beds and learn to cook.I believe she lay awake at night thinking up unkind things for us to do. Through the years,things didn't improve a bit.We could not lie in bed ""sick"" like our friends did in order to miss school.

How many suggestions does the writer give us about the unwanted clothes?	There are many ways for us to reduce waste. For example, we can reuse paper and plastic bags. We can also recycle newspapers, glass, and cans to make new things. Here are some useful ways to reduce waste. * Write on both sides of paper. Many people write on only one side of their paper. Why not stop wasting the other side? Some students only use half the pages of their notebooks before getting new ones. Try to use up all the paper. People often give cards on birthdays or festivals. How about trying to send e-cards instead? * Don't throw away your old batteries. Maybe you do not know that old batteries make the Earth dirty. This is because they have poisonous parts. So, don't throw away batteries. Keep them together. Try to use rechargeable batteries for your games and CD players. * Donate all your unwanted clothes. There are many poor families in China. You may ask your mother to collect your unwanted clothes. Then you can pass them on to those poor children who do not have clothes to wear. You will feel happy that you are helping someone else. Also, you can ask if your friends or relatives want them before throwing them away.	['Two.']

The best title for this article is	"Sometimes people call each other "" scared cat"" , but have you ever thought about this expression? When a cat is frightened, its heart starts beating faster, its muscles get tense, and there are changes in the chemicals in its blood-stream. If the danger continues, this animal will do one of the two things. It will defend itself, or it will run away as fast as it can. Something like this also happens to people. When we are excited, angry, scared, or aroused by other emotions, our bodies go through many physical changes. Our hearts beat faster, and our muscles get tense. All of these changes make us more alert and ready to react. We, too, get ready to defend ourselves or run. Human beings, however, have a problem. If we give way to our feelings and let them take over, we can get into trouble. Have you ever said something in anger - and regretted later? Have you ever shouted at a teacher or told somebody you were lonely and then wished later you had kept your mouth shut? It isn't always wise to express your feelings freely. Does this mean that it's always smarter to hide our feelings? No! If you keep feelings like anger hidden away or bottled up inside, your body stays tense. Physical illnesses can develop, and you can feel disturbed badly inside. _ can actually be bad for your health. Feelings that you keep all bottled up inside don't just go away. It's as if you bought some bananas and stuck them in a cupboard. You might not be able to see them, but before long you'd smell them. And if you opened the cupboard, chances are you'd see little fruit flies hovering all over them. They'd be rotten. You can try to treat emotions as if they were bananas in the cupboard. You can hide them and you can pretend they don't exit, but they'll still be around. And at last you'll have to deal with them, just like those bananas."	['Emotions Affect Our Bodies']
What can we infer from the passage?	"Andy was still traveling in Spain when he realized he had to confirm his flight home with the airline company . He was visiting Spain in order to improve his Spanish. When he was speaking to people face to face, he had no difficulty understanding what they said. However, when he was speaking on the phone, he still had a problem. Andy called the airline. And the clerk confirmed that his plane was leaving at nine o'clock three days from that day. She also told Andy to be at the airport two hours earlier in order to check in his luggage and get a seat. Since he was leaving in three days, Andy didn't lose any time. He visited as many places as he could. He thought that it would probably be a while before he had enough money again. He wished he could come back and spend a year in Spain. Too quickly, the final day arrived. Andy left early for the airport to arrive two hours before take-off. He hated to rush. He went to the clerk to show his ticket. The clerk looked at the ticket in surprise. ""Why, sir, but your flight was at nine o'clock in the morning, and now it is eight in the evening."" ""But I confirmed my flight,"" insisted Andy. ""Will I have to pay for another ticket?"" ""No, sir. However, the next flight out will be three days from now."" Andy's look of shock turned to pleasure as he realized that now he could continue his vacation."	['Andy was enjoying himself when visiting places in Spain.']
What made Clemmons think of her kite-lifting idea?	"No one really knows how the ancient Egyptians build the pyramids. But Maureen Clemmons has a theory . She thinks the Egyptians may have used kites. ""If you look at ht top center of every monument , you see wings,"" Clemons said. ""I think the Egyptians have been trying to tell us in pictures for 3,000 years that this is how they built the pyramids."" She thinks that earliest Egyptian workers might make use of kites to lift the stones with the help of the desert wind. She got a team of aeronautic engineers to help her test the theory. Yesterday, in the Mojave Desert, they put their theory to the test using a nylon kite, three pulleys and an obelisk that weighs nearly four tons. The wind speed had to be just right. And amazingly, it worked. ""There's ly no evidence for kites in ancient Egypt,"" said Professor Carol Redmount of the University of California. ""There's no evidence of pulleys as we know them today."" Redmount says the historical evidence points to the ""Charlton Heston method,"" which basically relies on the theory of the muscle of slaves pushing and pulling huge stone blocks to create the pyramids. But the kite-lifting group will have none that. ""All I can remember from history is that Egyptians drank beer for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and as someone who has done field research on drinking beer, I know after I've had two beers and it's really hot. I'm not pushing or pulling anything,"" Clemmons said. ""So, I figured I'd try to think another way."""	['The wings on the monuments.']
Which of the following words can best describe the author's feeling when she saw the daffodils?	"Several times my daughter had telephoned to say, ""Mother, you must come to see the daffodils before they are over."" I wanted to go, but it was a two-hour drive from Laguna to Lake Arrowhead, ""I will come next Tuesday, I promised a little unwillingly on her third call The next Tuesday dawned cold and rainy.Still, I had promised, and I drove there.When I finally walked into Carolyn^ house I was welcomed by the joyful sounds of happy children.I delightedly hugged and greeted my grandchildren. ""Forget the daffodils, Carolyn! The road is invisible in these clouds and fog, and there is nothing in the world except you and these children that I want to see badly enough to drive another inch!"" My daughter smiled calmly and said, ""We drive in this all the time,Mum."" ""You will never forgive yourself if you miss this experience."" After about twenty minutes, we turned onto a small gravel road and I saw a small church.On the far side of the churchtI saw a hand-lettered sign that read, ""Daffodil Garden."" We got out of the car* each took a child's hand, and I followed Carolyn down the path.Then, as we turned a corner, I looked up and gasped Before me lay the most beautiful sight There were five acres of flowers! But ""Who has done this?"" I asked Carolyn.""Just one woman,"" Carolyn answered ""That's her home."" Carolyn pointed to a well-kept A-frame house.-We walked up to the house.

According to the passage, which of the following is WRONG?	Now, are you changing your living habits to have a l _ life? Here are some strategies for you. Strategy One *Each week, choose one day when you don't eat meat. Meat takes up lots of energy because it takes a long time to produce. And animals must be fed on farmed plants, which could be used to feed many more people. Strategy Two *Only buy the amount of food you need. When you buy food, go local rather than imported , and get fresh vegetables instead of frozen. Strategy Three *Make sure you keep the things such as paper and plastic bottles separate so that they can be recycled. There are places where you can recycle batteries. Make sure you find them. Strategy Four *Take showers rather than baths and reduce your shower time by two minutes. This will save water and give you an extra two minutes in bed. Strategy Five *Buses and trains are better than cars, but walking or cycling is better still. It's also better for your health and cheaper. It can even be quicker than sitting in a car at rush hours in a busy city. For long distances, coaches are better than trains. Strategy Six *Try to buy good, long-lasting products even though they may cost a little more. A small screen TV is better than a big screen. Keep your electronic products one year longer than you would usually have.	"[""When you go for a long-distance trip, you'd better drive your own car.""]"
The story mainly tells us that _ .	As the sun rose, a dewdrop woke up. There it sat on a leaf, catching the sunlight. Proud of its simple beauty, it was very happy. Around it were other dewdrops, some on the same leaf and some on other leaves. The dewdrop was sure that it was the best, the most special dewdrop of them all. Ah, it was good to be a dewdrop. The wind blew and the plant began to shake, tipping the leaf. The dewdrop became frightened as it started to move towards the edge of the leaf. Why was this happening? Things were comfortable. Things were safe. Why did they have to change? Why? Why? The dewdrop reached the edge of the leaf. It was sure that this was the end. The day had only just begun and the end had come so quickly. It seemed so unfair. It seemed so meaningless. It tried hard to do whatever it could to stay on the leaf, but it was no use. Finally, it fell. Below there was a mirror. A reflection of the dewdrop seemed to be coming up to meet it. Closer and closer they came together until finally.., the small dewdrop became a part of the great pond . Now the dewdrop was no more, but it was not destroyed. It had become one with the whole.	"[""it's good to become one with the whole""]"
People tolerate violence and crime because _ .	"Who do you think breaks the law in our society? If you believe that only tough guys commit crimes, you may have to think again. Unlike in the movies, we can't divide the world into bad guys and model citizens. _ In the same way that diseases range from the common cold to fatal forms of cancer, crimes vary in degree. For example, smoking in an elevator will inconvenience people, but much less than threatening them with a gun. In addition to breaking the law themselves, people tolerate various levels of crime. Why can we tolerate some crimes? It may be that, by seeing others do something, we accept it more easily. For instance, most people will find it easier to speed on a highway when everybody else is driving over the speed limit. When people celebrate a sports championship, if they see someone breaking store windows, they might start breaking windows themselves or even steal from the store. So the people around us influence how much law-breaking we can tolerate. We must also wonder whether seeing violence on television or reading about it in the newspapers every day makes us tolerate crime more than we should. We become used to seeing blood on the news on television, or in full color in newspapers and magazines. Because we see thousands of dead people on TV, maybe we just try to ignore the situation behind the violence. If so many citizens tolerate violence and crime, or even commit crimes themselves, it may simply be because of the human mind. Our minds may not care about specific laws. Instead, our minds may have a system of values that usually prevents us from hurting other people to improve our own lives. Yet, when it comes to respecting the rights of a mass of anonymous individuals, we might not be so responsible. While most people would not steal a wallet containing $50, they may not mind cheating on taxes, because cheating on taxes does not hurt any one person. It hurts society, but ""society"" remains an abstract idea that is not as real as a neighbor or a friend's friend. When we realize that so many people have misunderstandings of law-breaking, it is not surprising that so many people tolerate crimes, or even break laws, including me. But how could we improve the level of honesty in our society? Would strict laws help make our society better? Probably not. Honesty will have to come from social pressure: in the family, at school, on the job, each and every one of us can encourage honesty by showing which behavior is unacceptable. And teaching respect should become everyone's responsibility."	['they hold mistaken beliefs about law-breaking']
When the writer didn't like the food his grandma cooked when he was growing up, _ .	"""Hey, Dad,"" one of my kids asked the other day, ""what was your favourite fast food when you were growing up?"" ""We didn't have fast food when I was growing up,"" I informed him.""All the food was slow."" ""Where did you eat?"" ""It was a place called 'at home'."" I explained.""Grandma cooked every day and when Grandpa got home from work, we sat down together at the dining table, and if I didn't like what she put on my plate I was allowed to sit there until I liked it."" Some parents never owned their own houses, set foot on a golf course, travelled out of the country or had a credit card. My parents have never driven me to soccer practice.This was mostly because we never had heard of soccer.I had a bicycle that weighed probably 50 pounds, and only had one speed.We didn't have a television in our house until I was 11.I was 13 when I tasted my first pizza; it was called ""pizza pie"".When I bit into it, I burned the roof of my mouth and the cheese slid off, swung down, plastered itself against my chin and burned that, too.It's still the best pizza I ever had. I delivered newspapers, six days a week .The paper cost 7 cents, of which I got to keep 2 cents.I had to get up at 4:00 a.m.every morning.On Saturday, I had to collect the 42 cents from my customers.My favourite customers were the ones who gave me 50 cents and told me to keep the change. If you grew up in a generation before there was fast food, you may want to share some of these memories with your children or grandchildren. Growing up isn't what it used to be, is it?"

Which of the following is NOT true?	"Donna is 19 years old and loves animals, which is why I'm always happy to leave my dog with her when I go on holiday. Donna also helps to train hunting dogs, but recently, her boyfriend told me, she returned home from a farm in tears after being told to hit some dogs. ""She wasn't being asked to hit them because they didn't behave well,"" he said. ""She was told to _ these puppies with a closed fist simply to let them know who is the boss,"" Donna refused. Good for Donna. In my view, you hit an animal for only two reasons: as a way to teach it an important lesson to protect it from danger, such as not into the road; or because you like hurting animals. Last summer, I attended a horse race. I don't know much about horses, but I was alarmed when I saw a horse with a huge ulcer on its legs. ""Surely this horse won't race?"" I asked. I was very surprised that nobody in the crowd seemed concerned. The horse began the race, but later it fell heavily. It had broken its leg. The next thing I saw was its dead body in a bag, being driven past. No one seemed to care, except those who had bet on it. I know people care for horse racing, but do they really care for horses? I doubt it. Oh, but it's a tradition, I hear you say. Wouldn't the world be a boring place if we didn't occasionally hit, shoot and chase animals? Traditions are made by man and can be unmade. It was once acceptable to kill servants when their master died, to visit the mental hospitals to laugh at the patients or to watch public execution . Nor should it be forgotten that in our progress to a more civilized world, animals have played an important role: they have fed us, carried us, worked for us, rescued us, died for us and sometimes just saved us from loneliness. Surely by now they deserve our kindness. At the very least, they deserve our respect."	['The author cannot accept anyone who hits the animals.']
After this experience, Jack _ .	"When my family moved to America from a small village in Guangdong, China, we brought not only our luggage, but also our village rules, customs and culture. One of the rules is that young people should always respect elders. Unluckily, this rule led to my very first embarrassment in the United States. I had a part-time job as a waiter in a Chinese restaurant. One time, when I was serving food to a middle-aged couple, the wife asked me how the food could be served so quickly. I told her that I had made sure they got their food quickly because I always respect the elderly. As soon as I said that, her face showed great displeasure. My manager, who happened to hear what I said, took me aside and gave me a long lecture about how sensitive Americans are and how they dislike the description ""old"". I then walked back to the table and apologized to the wife. After the couple heard my reason, they understood that the problem was caused by cultural differences, so they laughed and were no longer angry. In my village in China, people are proud of being old. Not so many people live to be seventy or eighty, and people who reach such an age have the most knowledge and experience. Young people always respect older people because they know they can learn from their rich experience. However, in the United States, people think ""growing old"" is a problem since ""old"" shows that a person is going to retire or that the body is not working well. Here many people try to keep themselves away from growing old by doing exercises or jogging, and women put on makeup, hoping to look young. When I told the couple in the restaurant that I respect the elderly, they got angry because this caused them to feel they had failed to stay young. I had told them something they didn't want to hear. After that, I changed the way I had been with older people. It is not that I don't respect them any more; I still respect them, but now I don't show my feelings through words."

When did Fidel Castro control the power of Cuba completely?	Cuba's former leader, Fidel Castro,died at the age of 90,according to a November 25 announcement on Cuban state television. The death marks the passing of a controversial figure who made a major impact on international affairs during his long rule. The Cuban government declared nine days of official mourning. On Monday, thousands of Cubans lined up near Havana's Plaza of the Revolution to pay their final respects to their leader. On Wednesday,Castro's ashes will begin a three-day journey across Cuba to Santa Ifigenia cemetery in Santiago de Cuba. Castro was born into a middle-class family on August 13 1926. He spent his childhood alongside the laborers on his father's plantation . In 1945, Castro entered the University of Havana as a law student. He later joined groups that sought to end dictatorships in Latin-American countries. On July 26. 1953,Castro staged an unsuccessful revolt against Batista's government. He and his brother Raul were captured and imprisoned for two years. After they were freed, the brothers went into exile in Mexico, On November 25, 1956,Castro set out once again to overthrow Batista. His revolution grew in strength. On New Year s Day 1959, Batista fled from Cuba. Castro took absolute power on January 8. The U.S. viewed Castro's relationship with the Soviet Union as a threat. In 1961,President John F. Kennedy approved the invasion of Cuba by 1,500 Cuban exiles. They landed on April 17 at the Bay of Pigs, but with little U. S. military support. Cuban troops smashed the attack within a few days. In October 1962,Castro confronted Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis, during which he allowed the Soviet Union to place nuclear-capable missiles in Cuba. By that time, the U. S. had cut all relations with Cuba. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,Cuba lost its economic support. To fuel the economy, the Cuban government allowed outside investment in hotels and resorts, but that created inequality. Meanwhile, Castro continued to crack down on any opposition. After undergoing intestinal surgery in 2006,Castro handed Cuba's presidency to Raul. The transition of power became official in 2008.	['In 1959.']
When getting lost, a visitor can ask natives for directions in _ .	"Have you ever been to the beautiful country of Holland and its capital Amsterdam? Anyone who has traveled to Amsterdam would probably agree on one thing: Amsterdam's story is a tale of two cities -- one during the day and a completely different one at night. During the day, the largest city in the Netherlands sits quietly on the Amstel River.You can rent a bicycle, visit the Van Gogh or Anne Frank museum, or take a water taxi.But when the sun goes down, the partying begins.In the big clubs and in coffee shops, tourists gather to hang out, talk politics and smoke. Several areas of the city clearly show the two worlds that rule Amsterdam.And they're all within a short cab ride of each other.For example, Dam Square attracts daytime sightseers to its festivals, open markets, concerts and other events.Several beautiful and very popular hotels can be found there.And there's the Royal Palace and the Magna Plaza shopping mall. But at night party-seekers come to the square.Hip hop or funk music is heard there..So if you come, be ready to dance.The clubs don't shut down until 4 am. And while you're there, check out the various inexpensive ways to tour the city.Don't worry about getting lost.Although Dutch is the official language, most people in Amsterdam speak English and are happy to help you with directions.And you'll notice that half the people in the streets are on bicycles they rent. Amsterdam also has a well-planned canal system.For about 10 dollars, you can use the canal bus or a water taxi to cruise the ""Venice of the North"". The city has a historic past.One impressive place to visit is the Anne Frank House on Nine Streets.It was there that the young Jewish girl wrote her famous diary during World War II.Visitors can view Anne's original diary and climb behind the bookcase to the room where she and her family hid from the Nazis for two years."

The passage is intended to _ .	"Most American schools have boys and girls in the same classroom. But a public high school in the small, rural town of Boonsboro, Maryland, offers a special program called the Academy. Top students in the ninth and tenth grades can attend single-sex classes for math, science, English and social studies. The aim is to help teenagers keep their mind on their work by keeping males and females apart. What they really want to do is take that top group of kids and take them to the very highest level they can achieve there, so that they're prepared for college. Students are invited to enter this program after they finish middle school, and placement in the Academy is voluntary. However, they need high marks and test scores and strong teacher recommendations. They also need to be involved in activities. Almost 350 students have taken part in the Academy. It began as an experiment in 2010. Michael Bair has been at Boonsboro High for twenty years and directs the Academy. His ninth-grade English class for boys centers on books that he believes boys find interesting. He says that the novels the students are reading now are very manly novels. These novels deal with the arrogance of man and the pride of man which finally leads to man's downfall. One of those books, for example, is The Call of the Wild by Jack London. This classic story tells of a dog stolen from his home and sold to work as a sled dog in Canada's Klondike Gold Rush. Morgan Fleet, a senior at Boonsboro High, likes being in the Academy. She says boys and girls act differently when they are together in a classroom. She believes this difference seems to prevent her from developing herself because she's more focused on thoughts like ""Oh, I wish they would shut up. Oh, what do they think of me?'' instead of focusing on ""What's the homework? What's going on in this class? What's the lesson?"". There is one activity that girls and boys in the Academy do together. At the end of the day, many of them stay and help tutor students who are having trouble in school."

Which of the following about the girl from Maryland is NOT true?	"An eighteen-year-old high school student from Utah won the top prize in the Intel Science Talent Search in the United States. The winner received a computer and a scholarship for a college education. More than 1,500students from across the country entered projects in the competition this year. Their research included chemistry, medicine, physics, mathematics, engineering, and computer science-almost every area of science. Forty students were invited to Washington, D.C. for the final judging. A group of scientists judged them on their research abilities, critical thinking skills and creativity. The judges also questioned the students about scientific problems before deciding on the winners. The top winner received 100,000 dollars for college. Shannon Babb of American Fork High School studied the water quality of tile Spanish Fork River in Utah for six years. She found that people have a harmful effect on the river through human activity, including agriculture. And she suggested ways to improve the water quality in the future. These include educating the public not to put household chemicals down the drains , which lead to the river eventually. Seventeen-year-old Yi Sun of the Hanker School in San Jose, California, earned the second place. He won a 75,000-dollar scholarship for new discoveries about a mathematical theory known as random walks. His work could help computer scientists and chemists. Yi Sun was born in China. The third-place winner was also seventeen and born in China. Yuan ""Chelsea"" Zhang of Montgomery Blair High School in Rockville, Maryland, won a 50,000-dollar scholarship. She researched the molecular genetics of heart disease. Her findings could aid the development of new medicines. The Intel Science Talent Search is the oldest science competition for high school students in the United States. It is 65 years old this year. Past winners have gone on to receive six Nobel prizes and other top honors in science and math."	['Her discovery is of great help to Chinese medicine.']
Which of the following about Doctor Ysisuf's experiment on Polycap in India is True?	Studies have shown that the fewer medicines a person has to take the more likely he or she will take them. Last week, a study was released about a new treatment that combines 5 medicines for heart disease in one pill. Salim Yusuf of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada was the lead investigator. He presented the findings at the American College of Cardiology Conference in Orlando, Florida. The experimental drug is known as Polycap. It contains aspirin, a drug to lower cholesterol and three medicines to lower blood pressure. The study was carried out at 50 health centers across India. More than two thousand people between the ages of 45 and 80 took part in the study. All had at least one risk factor for heart disease. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes or being severely overweight. The people were divided into 9 groups of about 200 people each. One group took Polycap. The other groups took either a single drug or different combinations of the medicines in the Polycap pill. The study showed that Polycap lowered blood pressure and cholesterol without many side effects. Doctor Yusuf said the single pill, taken once a day, could reduce the average person's risk of heart disease and stroke by about half. The maker of Polycap, Cadila Pharmaceuticals of India, paid for the study. Cardiovascular diseases of the heart and blood vessels are the number one cause of death around the world. These diseases kill more than seventeen million people every year. 80 percent of them are in low and middle income countries. Doctor Yusuf said the single pill treatment could revolutionize heart disease prevention. People would be more likely to take one pill a day than many pills. And one pill would cost less than several pills. Other heart doctors say heart disease prevention is important but not necessarily with pills. They say patients might be able to get the same results with changes in diet and exercise. Doctors say that more research on Polycap is needed. They say the drug should be tested on thousands more people, including those in different risk, age and ethnic groups.	['Polycap was proved basically safe and effective.']
Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage?	"It must have been around nine o'clock when I drove back home from work because it was already dark. As I came near to the gates I turned off the head lights of the car so as to prevent the beam from swinging through the window and waking Jack, who shared the house with me. But I needn't have done so. I noticed that his light was still on, so he was awake anyway--unless he had fallen asleep while reading. I put the car away and went up the steps. Then I opened the door quietly and went to Jack's room. He was in bed awake, but he didn't even turn towards me. ""What's up, Jack?"" I asked. ""For God's sake, don't make a noise,"" he said. The way he spoke reminded me of someone in pain who is afraid to talk in case he does himself serious injury. ""Take your shoes off, Neville,"" Jack said. I thought that he must be ill and that I had better give way to him to keep him happy. ""There is a snake here,"" he explained. ""It's asleep between the sheets. I was lying on my back reading when I saw it.I knew that moving was _ . I could not have moved even I'd wanted to."" I realized that he was serious. ""I was depending on you to call a doctor as soon as you came home,"" Jack went on. ""It has not bitten me yet but I dare not do anything to upset it. It might wake up. I'm sick of this,"" he said.""I took it for granted that you would have come home an hour ago.""

The author didn't tell Grandpa his love because _ to say love to Grandpa before.	"It was midday when I got the call that my grandfather was not well and he was quickly getting worse. My family did not know how long he would stay in the world. I knew I had to get to the hospital to tell him how much I loved him. As I drove to the hospital, I pictured him before I got to tell him how much he meant to me. Trying to fight back the tears, I wanted to stay calm when I saw him. When I got to the hospital, I hurriedly looked for his hospital room. I found him in a semi-conscious state . On my knees, I said softly, ""Hello, Grandpa."" Still feeling shy, I decided not to leave his bedside without letting him know. While I asked about how he was, he told me, ""I'll be fine, Henry."" although we both knew that wasn't true. Then he asked me with a smile how I was doing. Hearing what my grandpa said, I was much moved. I made the decision that I had to show my _ for him. As I found all the courage I had, I hold his hand tightly. I cried out, ""Grandpa. I just want to let you know how much I love you. I hope you already know that yet I just want to make sure."" By this time, tears were rolling down my face. All those years of love that I had shut and not let him know, became free. Smilingly, he said, ""I know. Thank you for telling me that. All I have on this planet is my family and my love for them. If there is anything I could ask of you, I want you to be good to your family, your mother, your father, and your brother. That's all I want of you."" What I learned that day changed my whole life. From then on, I began telling people how much I love them, care for them, and respect them. I get in touch with, for example, my babysitter, my barber, to show my appreciation. I go down into the city once a week and serve pizza to the homeless. I wake up every morning and list everything I'm thankful to in my life."	['he was too shy']

When was Oxford University probably founded?	Morocco, a North African kingdom, is on the south of the Mediterranean Sea and on the east of the Atlantic Ocean, between Algeria and Western Sahara. Morocco became independent from France in 1956. People in Morocco speak Arabic, which is the official language. Some people speak French and Spanish. 98.7% of the people believe in Islam. The capital city of Morocco is Rabat. Casablanca, in the north of this country, is the largest city. The famous movie Casablanca tells a story which happened in this city. It seldom rains in Morocco. The coastal cities are not cold in winter (around 16degC) and not hot in summer (around 22degC). In the inland areas, winters are colder and summers warmer. High up in the mountains the temperature can be as cold as -17.8degCin winter, and mountain tops are covered with snow most of the year. The population of Morocco is about 31,000,000. Most children in Morocco go to primary school, but only about 39% of them go to secondary school. However, this country has one of the oldest universities in the world, hundreds of years older than Oxford University. It is Al Qarawiyin University in Northern Morocco, which was founded in AD 859.

From the passage, we can know that a boy looks like his parents because _ .	"DNA is one of the most important discoveries in science. DNA is the plan for the human being, as a blueprint is the plan for a building. DNA makes a person look the way he does. A person's DNA comes from a mixing of his parents' DNA. That's why a child looks like his parents. But, besides controlling things such as height and hair color, DNA can also give people diseases. Scientists are now studying DNA to cure diseases. In the seventies, scientists developed a process called recombinant or RDNA. Although it sounds difficult to understand, RDNA simply means taking DNA from one animal or plant and putting it into another. By doing so, scientists can create new beings. In doing so, scientists can better understand DNA, especially what parts of DNA do what. After they understand DNA, scientists can begin to cure diseases. Often, the new being created will itself be the cure. Besides curing diseases, RDNA research can also do other things. For example, scientists in Japan have already created ""super-trees"". Trees help humans, because they take CO2, which poisons humans, from the air and turns it into oxygen, which lets humans breathe. ""Super-trees"" do this too, but do it much faster. As things such as cars and factories have already put much CO2in the area, ""super-trees"" are badly needed. Unfortunately, there is a serious danger in RDNA research. Scientists want to create animals to cure old diseases, but these new animals may also create new diseases. It will be a serious problem if the animals escape from the science laboratory and into nature. As these animals are not natural, they may _ many new powerful diseases. As a result, RDNA research will create many solutions, but it will also create many problems."	"[""his parents' DNA decides his appearance.""]"
When Grennan came to the Little Princes Children's Home. _ .	"Conor Grennan was unwilling to be a volunteer . The 29-year-old American was not sure if he had the skills or a strong feeling for it. However, he went to work at an orphanage in Nepal. His first thought was to make people impressed. ""I thought that if I volunteered just once. I could retell the story over and over,"" Grennan said in a Huffington Post article. However, his three-month stay it the orphanage turned into in unusual experience. It was 2004 and Grennan had given up his job to begin a year-long around-the-world trip, His first three months were spent in Nepal. When he arrived in the village, he knew nothing about the children or the local culture. When he opened the gate of the Little Princes Children's Home, he was faced by the excited children. The young American ended up caring for 18 children. He later discovered that they were trafficked children. So he walked through the mountains with great difficulty to find the kids' families, ""I started walking with photos of the kids."" he told the Reuters reporter. ""I would show up in villages and show photographs around. I went with 24 photos, and I found 24 families."" At the same time, he put his heart into Nepalese culture.

What did the writer think of her experience?	I never knew how amazing it would feel to help a family 4,560 miles away from my home. I never knew how great an effect I could have on that single family. From the moment I walked into French class, I knew almost instantly that I belonged there. My teacher, Madame Weiser, is a kind and caring woman, and is the person who started the interest within me to help a family abroad, no matter how many miles apart. Back in 2011, my teacher traveled as a tourist to Maxi, a country settled in West Africa with a large French-speaking population. She didn't expect to adopt an entire family, but fate had other plans. Madame met a nice man named Monsieur Diarra, a driver who had shown her the way through the dry lands of Mali. Mali is now a war-torn country and unsafe for tourists to visit, leaving little work for taxi drivers. Madame Weiser realized how Monsieur Driarra's family struggled on a daily basis, for he had a wife and four children to support as well as their grandmother, so she made a final decision to send the family as much money as she could raise every month. Now, three years later, Madame Weiser has still kept up her fund, collecting money from family and friends as well as students to support _ . It has become more than just my teacher donating to her adopted family abroad. As president of French Club at my high school and a French Honor Society member, I decided that our club should work to raise money for the family in need. By washing cars, we raised over $1,000. From my experience, I've learned that making an effort is worth more than anything. Its effect is priceless!	['Satisfying.']
We can conclude from the critic's words that _ .	"If you are not any kind of a longtime A-list New Yorker celebrity like Woody Allen,chances are that you have never experienced,and will never experience-a meal in a legendary Italian-American restaurant called Rao's. Rao's,the East Harlem restaurant with a history of more than l00 years,is simply the toughest restaurant to get a reservation in the US, if not the world.Michelin three-star restaurants like elBulli in Spain,often ranked the world's top restaurant,would sell out the second phone lines opened.But in the case of Rao's,the phone lines never open. There are about a dozen tables in the tiny restaurant, and each is spoken for, semi-permanently, as regulars have had their reservations for years, and when they can't use them,they often gift them to friends. The place is so small that the owners rarely have the flexibility to do favors even for people they know. Since it is always busy,there has never been a need for publicity.The last remarkable national review of the restaurant came from The New York Times more than 35 years ago.It was already tough to get a table at Rao's but reservations have been non-existent ever sincce the magic review. According to a critic who is ""very, very lucky to have dined at Rao's a few times,""the experience rivals the tasty food.There are no menus at Rao's, and one of the owners will pull up a chair and run through the massive list of options, allowing people to have diner by mixing and matching nearly any ingredient with any classical Italian style of cooking. The place doesn't take credit cards, isn't open on weekends or for 1unch, and ""at some point during your meal the one-room restaurant will almost unavoidably break out in song."" It is truly one of a kind,""the critic wrote."	"[""the experience dining in Rao's is as unforgettable as its food""]"
After being equipped with a set of wheels, Mrs T can move by using _ .	"A 90-year-old tortoise is going twice its usual speed after being equipped with a set of wheels. The animal, called Mrs T, was facing a terrible future after losing her two front legs in a mouse attack while she was sleeping in winter, but her owners glued the wheels onto her shell . ""She's going double the speed she used to,"" said the owner Jude Ryder, ""She uses her back legs to push herself along and seems quite happy."" The 58-year-old owner was surprised when she went to check on her loved pet last month and found her front legs had been eaten in the mouse attack. The local animal doctor tried his best to save Mrs T. But he was afraid that the tortoise would not survive without being mobile. After paying PS1,000 for the treatment, Mrs Ryder turned to her son Dale for help. Dale designed the front wheels and used resin to add them to the front of the shell. Mrs Ryder said: ""She liked them immediately, but she must learn how to turn and stop. She can get a good speed up, much faster than before. Mrs T is still quite young for a tortoise. She could go on for another 50 years. All she needs is a new set of tyres sometimes."" When Mrs T was sixty years old, she was bought as a pet for Dale, an 8-year-old boy. It liked running happily in Mrs Ryder's garden in spring and summer. When winter came, Mrs T slept in the garden shelter. A mouse got in last month and chewed off both her front legs. Mrs Ryder said: ""We were afraid she would be sure to die, but her new set of wheels have saved her life. She can run in the garden again and we can always find her because she leaves very strange footprints behind wherever she goes."" Mice attacking tortoises is not uncommon around us--in 2013 Britain's oldest tortoise died after a mouse attack. The tortoise called Thomas was 130 when he was bitten at his home in Guernsey.

The Food Network got to know Lieberman _ .	"Growing in Philadelphia, Lieberman started cooking with his stay-at-home dad when he was seven. His food-loving family had two kitchens, and quickly learned what was the best way to bake his cakes. Lieberman improved his kitchen skills greatly during a year abroad before college, learning from a cook in Italy and studying local specialties in Germany, Spain and France. At Yale, he was known for throwing dinner parties, single-handedly frying and baking while mixing drinks for dozens of friends. Just for fun, he and some friends decided to tape a show named Campus Cuisineabout his cooking. Lieberman was a real college student showing his classmates how to do things like make drinks out of dining-hall fruit. That helped the show become very popular among the students. They would stop Lieberman after classes to ask for his advice on cooking. Tapes of the show were passed around, with which his name went beyond the school and finally to the Food Network. Food Network producer Flay hopes the young cook will find a place on the network television.

Which of the following is NOT true?	Most people heard of Shakespeare and probably know something of his plays. However, not everybody knows much about the life of this world - famous man, except perhaps that he was born in the market town of Stratford - upon - Avon and that he married a woman called Anne Hathaway. We know nothing of his school life. Nothing certain is known of what he did between the time he left school and his leaving home for London. It is said that he was beaten and even put in prison for stealing rabbits and deer from a neighboring landowner, and because of this he was forced to leave his native place. Whatever caused him to leave his hometown, the world can be thankful about it. When he arrived in London, he set his foot on the road to farm. It is said that he was without money or friends there at first, but that he made a little money by taking care of the horses of the gentlemen who attended the plays at the theatre. In time, he came to know the doctors in the theatre, and they found him clever. Finally he was invited to join their company. By 1592, he had become one of the three members of a famous company. From what we know of his later life, it is clear that Shakespeare' s connection with theatre had made him a wealthy man since he wrote the plays, which attracted a good many people. Towards the end of the 16th century he bought a large property in Stratford. No less than eleven of his plays were produced after he went back there. These include the great tragedies Othello, Macbeth and King Lear. Shakespeare died in 1616. Some years earlier he chose it gravestone . He wrote on the stone that if anyone might remove his body from his grave, he would bring bad luck on him. It seems strange that he should have had this fear. He might have known how deeply he was respected for the genius he showed in his plays and poems.	['Shakespeare wrote as many as eleven plays in his life.']
What is the main idea of the passage?	"The rise of the so-called ""boomerang generation"" is revealed in official figures showing that almost one in five graduates in their late 20s now live with their parents. By contrast, only one in eight university graduates had failed to fly the nest by the same age 20 years ago. It also found that grown-up sons are twice as likely as their sisters to still be living with their parents in their late 20s. With nearly a quarter of men approaching 30 still living at home, the findings are bound to lead to claims of a ""generation of mummy's boys"". Young professionals in their late 20s or early 30s have been nicknamed the ""boomerang generation"" because of the trend toward returning to the family home having initially left to study. Recent research has suggested that young people in Britain are twice as likely to choose to live with their parents in their late 20s than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe. Growing housing prices, rising student debts and the effects of recession on the job market have forced a wave of young people to move back into the family home at an age when they would normally be moving out. But commentators warned that the phenomenon may have more to do with young people facing "" _ "" prospects than simply a desire to save money. While the proportion of those of university or college age moving out from the family home has continued to rise in the last 20 years, among those in their mid and late 20s the trend has been reversed. Overall 1.7 million people aged from 22 to 29 now share a roof with their parents, including more than 760,000 in their late 20s. In 1988, 22.7 per cent of men aged 25 to 29 were still living with their parents but last year the proportion was 24.5 per cent."	['More young professionals are returning home to live.']
What can people do to overcome procrastination?	"After studying the daily habits of 177 self-made millionaires over the course of five years, Thomas C. Corley found that they avoid one costly habit: procrastination . ""It prevents even the most talented individuals from realizing success in life,"" he writes in his upcoming book, ""Change Your Habits, Change Your Life."" This goes hand-in-hand with author Napoleon Hill's claim that the wealthiest people are also the most decisive people. Out of the 500 millionaires Hill studied in the early 20thcentury, ""Every one of them had the habit of reaching decisions quickly,"" Hill wrote in his 1937 classic, ""Think and Grow Rich."" One of the major causes of procrastination is lack of passion, Corley emphasizes: ""We simply like to do the things we like to do and we put off the things we do not like to do."" ""According to Gallup, only 13% of employees are 'engaged' in their jobs, or emotionally invested in their work,"" Corley writes. ""Whether you realize it or not, procrastination is a big reason why you are struggling financially in life. It damages your credibility with employers and fellow colleagues at work. It also affects the quality of your work and this affects the business you or your employer receive from customers, clients, and business relationships."" The good news is that anyone can overcome procrastination -- and it's simpler than you may think. He also notes that ""the voice of procrastination screams just as loud and clear in the minds of those who _ in life as it does in the minds of those who do not."" How do they silence it? They rely on ""to-do"" lists to get things done. They create firm deadlines, and they meet with ""accountability partners"" to ensure they're sticking to their goals and deadlines, Corley says. Nearly everyone is susceptible to procrastination -- but fighting against it can make all the difference."	['Accomplish things on schedule.']
The author writes the passage to _ . ks5u	"Sports can help you keep fit and get in touch with nature. However, whether you are on the mountains, in the waves, or on the grassland, you should be aware that your sport of choice might have great influence on the environment. ks5u Some sports are resource-hungry. Golf, as you may know, eats up not only large areas of countryside, but also tons of water. Besides, all sorts of chemicals and huge amounts of energy are used to keep its courses in good condition. This causes major environmental effects. For example, in the dry regions of Portugal and Spain, golf is often held responsible for serious water shortage in some local areas. ks5u There are many environment-friendly sport. Power walking is one of them that you could take up today. You don't need any special equipment except a good pair of shoes;and you don't have to worry about resources and your purse. Simple and free, power walking can also keep you fit. If you walk regularly, it will be good for your heart and bones. Experts say that 20 minutes of power walking daily can make you feel less anxious, sleep well and have better weight control. ks5u Whatever sport you take up, you can make it greener by using environment-friendly equipment and buying products made from recycled materials. But the final goal should be ""green gyms"". They are better replacements for traditional health clubs and modern sports centers. Members of green gyms play sports outdoors, in the countryside or other open spaces. There is no special requirement for you to start your membership. And best of all, it's free. ks5u"	['encourage us to go in for green sports ks5u']

What don't you need to do to make your mornings less stressful?	To be punctual is important for us because people rather expect us to be on time for appointments. But it seems not easy to be on time every time. Here are some useful methods to help you be punctual. Plan your route. If your destination is unfamiliar, go online the night before to map out your route and see how long it's going to take. Then you will know when you have to leave the house. Do as much as possible the night before. Make your mornings less stressful by doing what you can the night before to make your time enough. Get your clothes ready. Set the breakfast table. Make your lunch if you need to take it. Make a time table. You need to make a time table if you have lots of things to do in a day. For example, the time you get up, the time you leave the house, and the time you wait for the bus. You also need to estimate how long it takes. Give yourself a gift of being early. If you plan to get to your destination 15 minutes early, you'll probably never be late again. Being early seems a waste of time. But you can do something you love. Read the newspaper, read your favorite blogs and even call a friend. It really can be a gift.	['Make a time table.']
What is the main idea about this passage?	Common sense would tell us that physically active children may be more likely to become active and healthy adults. In the United States, elementary and middle schools are advised to give students two and a half hours of physical activity a week. That is what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association recommend. They say high schools should provide about four hours of physical activity each week. Yet many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs. Just this week, a study reported that life _ has fallen or is no longer increasing in some parts of the United States. The situation is worst among poor people in the southern states, and especially women. Public health researchers say it is largely the result of increases in fatness, smoking and high blood pressure. They also blame differences in health services around the country. In 2006, a study found that only four percent of primary schools provided daily physical education all year for all grades. This was true of eight percent of middle schools and two percent of high schools. The study also found that twenty-two percent of all schools did not require students to take any P.E. Charlene Burgeson , a health expert says one problem for P.E. teachers is that schools are under pressure to put more time into academic subjects. Also, parents may agree that children need exercise in school. Yet many parents today still have bad memories of being chosen last for teams because teachers favored the good athletes in class. But experts say P.E. classes have changed. They say the goal has moved away from competition and toward personal performance, as a way to build a lifetime of activity. These days, teachers often lead activities like weight training and yoga. Some parents like the idea of avoiding competitive sports in P.E. class. Yet others surely dislike that idea. In the end, schools may find themselves in a no-win situation.	['It introduces us the present situation of P.E in American schools and its cause.']

Swimming in the sea you'd better not swim _ .	In America,Virginia Beach has all the elements of a classic seaside resort:brilliant beaches,a lively boardwalk,plenty of restaurants and nightspots,and amusement rides sure to appeal to kids.Many believe Virginia Beach is at its best in the off-season,when the town is less crowded but the weather is still mild. Meanwhile,some safety tips should be followed,enjoying the happiness and excitement the beach offers. The number l safety tip concerns ocean safety:pay attention to Flag conditions posted on the lifeguard stands.Lifeguards post a red flag to warn when the ocean water is dangerous.Take them seriously! Tourists from land-locked regions are particularly easily attracted by the magic of the waves.However,a calm ocean can become risky without warning.Make sure you swim near a lifeguard.Swimming without lifeguard protection is almost five times as great as drowning at a beach with lifeguards. Never swim alone.Many drownings involve single swimmers.When you swim with someone else,if one of you has a problem,the other may be able to get help,including signaling for assistance from others. Don't fight the current.The facts show that some 80% of rescues by lifeguards at ocean beaches are caused by currents.These currents are formed by surf and gravity,because once surf pushes water up the slope of a beach,gravity pulls it back.This can create concentrated rivers of water moving offshore.If you are caught in a rip current,don't fight it by trying to swim directly to shore.Instead,swim parallel to shore until you feel the current relax,then swim to shore.Most rip currents are narrow and a short swim parallel to shore will help bring you to safety.

Which of the following was NOT a true effect of jet lag on hamsters according to the text?	When a person travels over long distances, the place may not be the only change. When his or her body rhythms get thrown off, he or she suffers from jet lag -- it's hard to sleep and eat at the right times in the new location. Humans and animals have a biological clock in their body that tells them when to sleep, and when to wake. When someone comes to a different place far away, this biological clock takes a while to match the day and night time of the new place. In a new study, reported in November's Science News, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley tested the effects of jet lag on hamsters . They wanted to know how serious jet lag would affect the brain and thinking habits of the animals. They think what happens to hamsters may happen to humans, too. In their experiments, the researchers first moved the hamsters' schedules forward by six hours. The animals' eating schedules, for example, were changed. If a hamster was often fed at noon and 4 pm, then it ate at 6 pm and 10 pm on the new schedule. People who travel from China to Europe experience the same shift, since the two regions are about six hours apart, half the shift between China and the USA. After three days, the scientists did it again - they shifted the hamsters' schedules forward by another six hours. Three days after that, they did it again; and then again three days later. For a full month, the scientists changed the hamsters' routines every three days. During the study, the hamsters slept the same amount every day as they did before the study. However, their sleep patterns had a hard time keeping up with the changing schedule. What's more, they seemed to feel low. The researchers also found that the hamsters had trouble with basic learning exercises during the study. The animals' thinking problems didn't go away when the experiment was over. A month after they went back living on a normal schedule, the hamsters still had trouble with basic mental tasks, such as learning and memory. The scientists concluded that serious jet lag has serious side effects, including stupidity . They are now trying to find out how jet lag is causing these problems, and then it will be possible for them to work out a solution.	['They slept more than before.']
We'll feel _ in the good environment .	"When we buy a house, we all want to have nice neighbours, because most of us think that it is helpful to live with some good neighbours.

If our neighbours try to know more about our life, what will we feel? He or she may also talk with others about our life. Do you want to live with him or her any more? The answer is ""No"". We will feel very sad to have this kind of neighbour and move away quickly. Next, a good neighbour is always ready to give us a hand when we need him or her. For example, if we are not at home, our good neighbours will watch our house for us. Finally, a good neighbour should love the environment . He or she never puts rubbish here and there.

Which of the following about the Curiosity rover is TRUE ?	"In today's congratulatory phone call to the team behind NASA's Mars Curiosity rover , President Barack Obama made sure that if the mission discovers Martians, he'll be one of the first to know. ""If in fact you do make contact with Martians, please let me know right away,"" Obama said during the call, ""I've got a lot of things on my plate, but I expect that that will go to the top of the list. Even if they're just microbes , it will be pretty exciting."" Obama also said he was impressed by the attention that's been paid to flight director Bobak Ferdowsi, the ""Mohawk Guy"" whose star-spangled haircut and warmhearted behavior during Curiosity's Aug. 5 landing won him Internet fame. ""I, in the past, thought about getting a Mohawk myself,"" Obama joked. ""But my team keeps on discouraging me. And now that he's received marriage proposals and thousands of new Twitter followers, I think I'm going to go back to my team and see if it makes sense."" The congratulatory phone call is a tradition for the White House. But it was clear that Obama particularly enjoyed congratulating the scientists and engineers behind the amazingly successful landing of NASA's newest Mars exploration. He also said the achievement reflected the American spirit, and he gave his personal promise to protect these critical investments in science and technology. ""This is the kind of thing that inspires kids across the country,"" he said. ""They're telling their moms and dads they want to be part of a Mars mission, maybe even the first person to walk on Mars. And that kind of inspiration is the byproduct of work of the sort that you guys have done."" The Curiosity rover's $2.5 billion mission focuses on studying billions of years' worth of geology on Mars and determining whether the planet was ever potentially suitable for people to live in. The mission is not specifically designed to explore life, even on the range of microbes, but it could point the way for future life-exploration experiments."	['It costs billions of dollars.']
What did the couple think of English food?	My wife and I spent two weeks in London last year. We went there in the autumn. We think it is the best season to visit England. The weather is usually good and there aren't too many tourists in October. We stayed in a small hotel in the West End. It was convenient as we did most of our sightseeing on foot. Taxis were too expensive, we couldn't understand the bus routes, and my wife didn't like traveling under the ground. She said it made her feel sick. We went to look at the places which all tourists visit. We saw Buckingham Palace. We went shopping in Oxford Street and spent too much money. What we liked most, though, was going to the theatre. We didn't have the chance to see such wonderful plays at home. A lot of people say English food is bad. We didn't think so. It is true that most of the restaurants are French or Italian or Chinese, but we had some very good meals. In fact, we enjoyed our holiday so much that we have already booked again for this year.

What do we know according to the latest UNICEF figures?	"Ethiopia has greatly reduced its death rates for children under the age of five years during the last two decades, new UN statistics show. The report says Ethiopia has cut the number of child deaths, by two thirds or so, to 68 per 1,000 births compared to that in 1990. The government owed the improved figures to its growing economy. Despite the reduction, the UN Children's Fund said Ethiopia needed to do much more to improve health facilities for pregnant women. Ethiopia is one of Africa's poorest states, although it has experienced rapid economic growth in recent years and is one of the continent's leading coffee producers. Its economy centers around agriculture, which in turn relies on rainfall. The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza in the capital, Addis Ababa, says Ethiopia was once representative of poor nutrition in Africa. But the latest UNICEF figures show Ethiopia is one of the few African countries on the path to realizing the development goal of reducing child death rates, he says. Ethiopia's Health Minister Kesetebirhan Admasu said increasing family incomes had helped improve people's health. ""This has also resulted in better nutrition for children and women; this has translated into better medical conditions ---- all these have a direct or indirect influence on the survival of children,"" he told BBC Africa. He said the government has also been ""aggressively expanding its primary health care network"". ""We have now 93% coverage( ) of one health centre for 25,000 people, which basically means one health facility within a 7km area,"" he said."

If the space animal theory is correct, the orange lights come down to the lower levels in order to _ .	On the night of July 6, 1943, a plane took off from an Air Force base in England to stop German fighters over the English Channel. Piloting the plane was Captain Thomas Nash. Looking westward, Nash saw twelve orange lights in a row, moving at a very high rate of speed. Thinking they might be a new German weapon, he swung the plane around and headed directly for the lights, but they disappeared. Captain Nash may have been the first to see such orange lights but he wasn't the last. His experience was repeated many times by pilots during World War II both in England and Far East. What were they? No one knows for sure, but there is an interesting theory to explain them. According to this theory, the orange lights are space animals---animals specially adapted to life in the upper atmosphere just as some living things are adapted to life at the bottom of the sea. These space animals, the theory says, live so far up in the atmosphere that they are not in sight from the earth. They feed partly on the air and partly on energy from the sunlight. Being almost pure energy themselves, their body shine at night. During the day, however, they are invisible. Before World War II, continues the theory, there was little radiated energy on the earth's surface. Then came the development of rockets, nuclear power stations and something like that. The space animals are attracted to these kinds of energy of food. At night when there is no energy from the sunlight, they come down into the lower levels in search of a meal. They may even float into the range of human eyesight. This explains the fact that they have been sighted many times from the earth since 1943.	['search for man-made energy']
What is the passage mainly about?	"""When I grow up, I want to be..."" Almost all of us have thought about, or been asked to think about, our future careers. Our answers may differ greatly. Even now your aspirations may have changed from when you were in primary school. However, it seems career options aren't only based on personal taste. In a survey carried out by Teens, doctors, lawyers, and bankers were some of most popular careers that people said they hoped to follow. This is in line with a similar survey carried out in the UK in May 2011 by job website monster. Co.uk, in which medicine was the top choice among UK teenagers aged between 13 and 17. Medicine and law are two of the oldest and best known professions. Their prestige may come from the fact that doctors and lawyers are some of the most esteemed members of society, and they make good money. Joining these high-profile professions is often seen as a sign of upward social mobility. It is equally unsurprising that banking is now one of the most common career choices. Youngsters worldwide think of banking and see the money rolling in. Wealth is increasingly becoming one of the most important indicators of a successful career. British young men list the UK tycoon Alan Sugar, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg as their top role models ""for their wealth"". Just as Chinese teenagers see being a banker as a good and fun pathway to ""wealth"". However, not every child has the makings of doctor, lawyer, or banker. They are those who see fulfillment and happiness in other areas, and many teenagers dare to ink more individuality into their career options. As the Teens' survey discovered, a variety of unconventional jobs---coffee shop owner, gourmet ,waiter at a fast food restaurant---are among teenagers' career choices. They can be equally interesting and rewarding jobs. With every choice comes responsibility and challenge, and all career paths require specific education and training, you have to learn to balance optimism and confidence with being realistic about your particular talents and skills."

It can be inferred from the passage that _	"The oceans are unique to our planet. No other planet in our solar system has liquid water. The oceans cover about 70% of the earth's surface. They contain about 97% of the earth's water supply. Life on earth originated in the seas. The oceans continue to be home to an incredible number of plants and animals. We know very little about the oceans. Because they are so deep and dark, they are hard to study. But scientists are discovering new strange creatures all the time. We are learning more by using satellites to look at the oceans' surfaces and by using buoys ( ) to measure temperature and saltiness. Special vehicles can now travel deep into the dark oceans to see what mysteries can be discovered. More of the sun's heat is assimilated by water along the equator than at the poles. This means the water at the equator is warmer than water at the poles. These different water temperatures cause the water in the oceans to move. This is called an ocean current. The air above ocean currents also moves. The warm or cold ocean air moves over the land as wind. Oceans are also a really important part of the water cycle. Evaporation from oceans creates most of the world's rainfall. Plants on land need the rain to absorb nutrients from the soil. The oceans are also home to all kinds of sea life. These include fish, whales, dolphins, octopi, lobsters, crabs and shrimps. There are also jellyfish and starfish.Many kinds of plants, such as plankton, kelp and sea grass are part of the ""forest of the seafloor."" Carbon dioxide in-oxygen out! Oceans help to capture and store carbon dioxide(C02). They are the largest natural ""carbon sinks"" in the world. Oceans trap about1/4of the CO2 that humans put into the air. Oceans also release oxygen. Half of the world's oxygen is produced by these tiny plants!"	['oceans provide humans with rich resources']
Many people can't remember their parents's phone numbers because _ .	If you need to call your parents but your phone is not with you, can you remember their numbers? To remember 11 numbers is not difficult. However, because of the smartphone, many of us are losing this ability. What's more, smartphones weaken our skills at giving directions, as well as killing face-to-face communications. Even when friends are having a meal together, it's common for most to check their phones. According to a report by Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, an American company, Chinese people spend about 170 minutes on their smartphones daily. Many students are _ to using smartphones. It does no good to their study. Research by Japan's Education Ministry showed children who spend more than four hours a day on their phones perform much worse in school test than those who play with their phones for 30 minutes. It's true that the smartphone has made our lives easier. But many also think they spend too much time on it, and this is bad for their study or work. People are trying to change that. A new app called Forest was introduced this month. It lets users plant a seed that grows into a tree over the next 30 minutes. During the half hour, users cannot use their phones, or the tree will die. A restaurant in Los Angeles, US, gives people a 5% discount if they don't check their phones during a meal. Owner Mark Gold said he hopes it gives people a way to enjoy their meal and actually talk with friends and family in person.	['they depend too much on smartphones']
How does the author seem to feel about the future of nuclear energy?	The crisis at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear energy center caused by the terrible earthquake has raised questions about the future of the nuclear energy industry. Arjun is president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in the United States. He says the disaster in Japan is historic. This week, the chairman of America's nuclear agency said there is little chance that harmful radiation from Japan could reach the United States. Gregory also said America has a strong program in place to deal with earthquake threats. No new nuclear power centers have been built in the United States since 1979. That was when America's worst nuclear accident happened at the Three Mile Island center in Pennsylvania. The accident began to turn public opinion against nuclear energy. At present, about twenty percent of electricity in the United States comes from nuclear energy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would close seven nuclear power centers for the time being while energy policy is reconsidered. The European Union is planning to test all centers in its twenty-seven member nations. Developing nations are less willing to slow down the development of nuclear. China says it will continue with plans to build about twenty-five new nuclear reactors . And India, under a cooperation agreement with the United States, plans to spend billions on new centers in the coming years. Nuclear reactors supply fourteen percent of global electricity. Nuclear energy is a clean resource, producing no carbon gases. But radioactive waste is a serious problem to be solved. So is the presence of nuclear power centers in earthquake areas like the one near Bushehr, lran.	['Worried.']
What's the best title of the passage?	Sometimes people come into your life and they were meant to be there, to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson, or to help you figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be-----a roommate, a neighbor, a professor, a friend, a lover or even a complete stranger------but when you lock eyes with them, you know at the very moment they will affect your life in some profound way. Sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair at first, but in reflection , you find that without overcoming those obstacles , you would have never realized your potential, strength, willpower, or heart. Every thing happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good or bad luck. Illness, injury, lost moments of true greatness, and pure stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved straight flat road to nowhere. It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless. The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience, help to create who you are and who you want to become. Even the bad experience can be learned from. In fact, they are sometimes the most important ones. If someone loves you, give love back to them in whatever way you can, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things. If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart. _ . Appreciate every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can for you may never be able to experience it again. Talk to people that you have never talked to before, and listen to what they say. Let yourself fall in love, break free and set your sights high. Hold your head up because you have every right to. Tell yourself you are a great individual and believe in yourself, for if you don't believe in yourself, it will be hard for others to believe in you.	['Create your own life']
The three skydivers jumped out of the plane at an altitude of about _ .	"""It was amazing, just impressive,"" Holly Budge, a 29-year-old British woman, said after making a safe landing at a spot 12,350 feet (3,765 meters) above sea level -- the highest ""drop zone"" achieved by a parachutist . ""We had one minute of freefall and while we were above the clouds you could see Everest and the other high mountains popping out of the top,"" she said. Ms Budge and her two fellow daredevils, Wendy Smith, from New Zealand, and Neil Jones, from Canada, jumped out of an aircraft at about 29,500 feet, just higher than the peak of the world's highest mountain. They fell at speeds reaching 140mph, past the highest ridges of the snow-covering Himalayas, before each released a parachute . The jumpers wore oxygen masks to keep their lungs working as they fell. Wearing neoprene underwear was compulsory -- to prevent them from being frozen to death. The adventure, advertised by its organizers as ""a feast for those who seek to stimulate all their senses to the full"", appeared to have lived up to its billing. ""I had never seen so many mountains before,"" Ms Smith said. ""To be on top of the world was simply stunning ."" The expedition also offered a way by which to celebrate her 30th birthday later this month, she said. Besides, her jump raised funds for charities in Britain and Nepal, including more than PS10,000 for the Hampshire Autistic Society. In the next few days the feat will be repeated by about 30 others, weather permitting. Each has paid at least PS12,675 to High and Wild, the British adventure travel company behind the project. Ms Budge said: ""It was worth the money. It is something that has never been done before."""	['8993 meters']
The key to keeping prices at a reasonable level lies in _ .	"BEIJING --With a series of measures being adopted to control price rise, the Chinese government is confident of keeping prices at a reasonable level, Premier Wen Jiabao said Sunday morning, asking people to remain confident. ""I believe we can keep prices at a reasonable level through our efforts. As a major leader of the government, I have the responsibility and I have the confidence, too."" He made the remarks while answering a listener's question during a radio broadcast by China National Radio. Steps taken in the past month, including price controls to curb speculation and monetary tightening , had started to produce results, he said. The government plans to build 10 million units of affordable housing in 2011, up from this year's target of 5.8 million. China will also increase efforts to curb speculation in the housing market, mainly through monetary policies and stricter use of land, Wen said, without giving details. Wen said the country had a good agricultural supply base which gave the government confidence that it could stabilize prices. In a bid to control inflation, the government has also increased the bank reserve requirement ratio six times and lifted interest rate twice this year, he added. Further, authorities have introduced many measures including cutting fees for transportation of agriculture products and controlling food price rise strictly. The overall price level, especially of major consumer goods, has now begun to drop, Wen said. ""The fundamental way to stabilize pri ces is to achieve a balance of supply and demand, which requires continuous development of agriculture,"" said premier, adding that the central government has worked out measures to increase agricultural production."

Why did Jack tell Tom and Martin the story?	"The light from the campfire brightened the darkness, but it could not prevent the damp cold of Dennis's Swamp creeping into their bones. It was a strange place. Martin and Tom wished that they had not accepted Jack's _ . They liked camping, but not near this swamp. ""So,"" Martin asked as they sat watching the hot coals. ""How did this place get its name?"" ""Are you sure you want to hear it ? It's a scary story,"" warned Jack. ""Of course!"" cried out Tom. ""If there were anything to be scared of, you wouldn't have chosen this place!"" ""Ok, but don't say I didn't warn you,"" said Jack, and he began this tale. ""Way back in time, a man called Dennis tried to start a farm here. He built that cottage over there to live in. In those days, the area looked quite different ---- it was covered with tall trees and the swamp was a crystal-clear river. After three hard years, Dennis had cleared several fields and planted crops. He was so proud of his success that he refused to listen to advice. ""'You are clearing too much land,' warned one old man. ' The land is a living thing. It will hit back at you if you abuse it. ' ""'Silly fool,' said Dennis to himself. 'If I clear more land, I can grow more crops. I'll become wealthier. He's just jealous!'"" ""Dennis continued to chop down trees. Small animals that relied on them for food and shelter were destroyed. He was so eager to expand his farm that he did not notice the river flowing slowly towards his door. He did not notice salt seeping to the surface of the land. He did not notice swamp plants choking all the native plants."" ""What happened?"" Martin asked. It was growing colder. He trembled, twisting his body closer to the fire. ""The land hit back ---- just as the old man warned,"" Jack shrugged. ""Dennis disappeared. Old folks around here believe that swamp plants moved up from the river and dragged him underwater. His body was never found."" ""What a stupid story,"" laughed Tom. ""Plants can't ..."" Before he had finished speaking, he screamed and fainted . The other two boys jumped up with fright, staring at Tom. Suddenly, they burst out laughing. Some green swamp ivy had covered Tom's face. It was a while before Tom could appreciate the joke."	['To satisfy their curiosity.']
According to the ban, _ .	"New York City plans to put a ban on the sale of large sodas and other sugary drinks at restaurants, movie theaters and street carts, in an effort to fight rising obesity. The ban would affect almost all the popular sugary drinks found in fast-food restaurants and even sports centers, from energy drinks to pre-sweetened iced teas. The sale of any cup or bottle of sweetened drink larger than 16 ounces would be forbidden under the first-in-the- nation plan. The measure would not apply to diet sodas, fruit juices, zero-calorie Vitamin Waters, dairy-based drinks like milkshakes , or alcoholic drinks; it would not expand to drinks sold in grocery stores or convenience stores. Stefan Friedman, spokesman for the New York City Beverage Association, criticized the city's plan, saying it turns focus away from the hard work that needs to be done on this front. Kelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, said he believes the ban would be effective. ""It is not right to put all the blame for obesity on sugar drinks, but they are strongly connected with this rise in obesity over the last 30 years."" Dr. Farley, the health commissioner, said the city had seen higher obesity rates in neighborhoods where soda consumption was more common. City officials said they believe it will finally prove popular and push governments around the U.S. to follow similar rules. Mr. Bloomberg has introduced a series of rules in his term of office, including bans on smoking in restaurants and parks, a ban on trans fat in restaurant food and a requirement for health inspection grades to be posted in restaurant windows. Because of the measures, the mayor was laughed at as Nanny Bloomberg, by those who view the bans as threats to personal freedom. But many of the measures adopted in New York have become models for other cities, including bans on smoking and trans fat, as well as the use of graphic advertising to fight smoking and soda consumption, and the demand that restaurants post calories contents next to prices."

Why do some big companies want to join in Second life?	Second Life is a 3D online world in which computer users can create a new life and live a different life. Second Life is one of the most popular new online games. But unlike other games, Second Life is not about winning or losing. Second Life is technically a computer game. But people involved in it do not consider it a game because the players create everything. Second Life is more for socializing and creating communities. Users of Second Life are called residents( ). To take part, they must create an avatar, or an electronic image of themselves. Some avatars look like humans, while others look like animals or imaginary creatures. Inside the Second Life world, residents live in different versions of themselves. They build homes, run businesses, buy and sell things, work, play, and attend schools. They even have relationships and get married. Second Life was created in 2003 by Linden Lab in San Francisco, California. Linden Lab controls the website where the ever-changing world is being created. There are now about one million people around the world who are active to Second Life. The number has grown quickly since the beginning of the year when there were about one hundred thousand users. The average age of people involved with Second Life is about thirty. However, Linden Lab has recently created Teen Second Life for young users. Second Life has its own economy and its own money, called Linden dollars. Millions of dollars are made and spent each month in Second Life. Users can enter Second Life for free. But they must pay for a membership if they want to own land or buy and sell goods and services. Recently, several major companies have become involved with Second Life. They want to be part of the growing business world that exists within the made-up reality.

At the 2013 CES, which item drew the most attention?	"Televisions were among the most talked about items at the 2013 International Consumer Electronics Show last week in Las Vegas, Nevada. Some employed the most advanced technology ever. Some of the TVs used a new technology called Organic Light Emitting Diodes, or OLED. They were thinner, lighter, offered better color1 and were brighter than traditional LEDs. Smart TVs this year were smarter. Many offered technology that let users have a more personalized experience. One such TV from the electronics company TCL uses sensors and voice recognition to determine who is watching. It then offers programming based on the specific user. Another TV from Panasonic offers a similar personalized user experience. In addition to television technology, size also played a major part in CES 2013. Televisions varied in size from big to bigger, with at least two companies -- Samsung and HiSense -- exhibiting TVs measuring 110 inches. The yearly Consumer Electronics Show is the biggest technology trade show in North America and one of the biggest in the world. Gary Shapiro is president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, the group that organizes CES. He gave one of the keynote speeches on opening day. ""Now you know that CES is more than a trade show. It's a gathering of the brightest minds and the top leaders from many industries and those seeking a glimpse into the future."" That glimpse into the future included a look at digital health and fitness devices, which were also big at CES 2013. There were devices that track your activity and others that measure blood pressure, heart rate and weight. There was even a fork that tells you when you are eating too fast. Cars, smart-phones, tablet computers and PCs also made news. And a 27-inch table computer drew quite a bit of attention. CEA President Gary Shapiro says there was much to see but not nearly enough time to see it all. ""You cannot see the show in the four days that you have. We have over 3200 different industries showing over 20,000 new products. It's ly incredible."""	['Televisions.']
Why couldn't the young student go to sleep?	"A Hard-working Student This story is about a young student. She worked very hard at her lessons. She was too busy to have a rest.

The measure to keep Asian carp out of the Great Lake but proved not good is _ .	"Seven species of carp native to Asia have been introduced into United States waters in recent decades, but it's four in particular-bighead, black, grass and silver-that worry ecologists, biologists, fishers and policymakers alike. Introduced in the southeast to help control weeds and parasites in aquaculture operations, these fish soon spread up the Mississippi River system where they have been crowding out native fish populations not used to competing with such aggressive invaders. The carps' presence in such numbers is also harming water quality and killing off sensitive species. Asian carp are strong to jump over barriers such as low dams. They lay hundreds of thousands of eggs at a time and spread into new habitat quickly and easily. Also, flooding has helped the fish expand into previously unattainable water bodies. And fishers using young carp as live bait have also helped the fish's spread, as they have boats going through locks up and down the Mississippi. The federal government considers the Asian carps to be annoying species and encourages and supports ""active control"" by natural resources management agencies. Federal and state governments have spent millions in tax dollars to prevent the carp from making their way into the Great Lakes, but an underwater electric fence constructed to keep them out has not worked as well as hoped, and policymakers are reviewing other options now. In the meantime, state and federal agencies are monitoring the Mississippi and its branches for Asian carp and testing various barrier technologies to prevent their further spread. For instance, the National Park Service is cooperating with the state of Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources to construct new dams that are high enough to prevent Asian carp from jumping over. The Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee has funded DNA monitoring in potentially affected water bodies whereby researchers can determine whether the troublesome fish are present just by the biological footprints they leave behind. Individuals can do their part by not transporting fish, bait or even water from one water body to another, and by emptying and washing boats before moving them between different water bodies."

According to Disney's new standards, _ .	"Mickey Mouse wants to help kids kick the junk food habit. The Walt Disney Company announced that it plans to advertise only healthier foods to kid. By 2015, all food and drink products that are advertised on its TV channels, radio stations and websites will have to meet the company's nutrition standard for limiting calories and reducing fat, sodium and sugar. Many foods, such as fruit drinks, candy and snack cakes, won't meet the standard. First Lady Michelle Obama called it a ""game changer"". ""Disney is doing what no major media company has ever done before in the US - and what I hope every company will do in the future."" ""This is a landmark , because a major media company is taking responsibility for what food they advertise to children,"" says Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy for the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""This should be a real wake-up call to Nickelodeon(an American children's channel) and the Cartoon Network to do the same."" But the company will still be able to advertise ""better-for-you versions of products that are not perfectly nutritious."" Under the new standards, breakfast cereals that are advertised will have to contain fewer than 10 grams of sugar in a serving, Wootan says. ""That's a good step forward, but it's not perfectly nutritious."" Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, says Disney is making this move ""at perhaps some risk of affecting their incomes, so that's why we should praise them."" Food marketing is really ""important because it shapes the way kids are fed,"" Wootan says. ""If we don't deal with food marketing to kids, we don't have any chance of addressing childhood obesity."" Currently, a third of children are overweight, putting them at a greater risk for serious health problems. At its theme parks, Disney began offering healthier kids' meals, serving carrots and other vegetables, fruits, low-fat milk and yogurt at meals, instead of fries and soft drinks."

How did the operation work for Darek Fidyka?	"Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey. The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said. Polish doctors injected the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves. Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true."" Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized. David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe. ""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said."

Scientists originally thought that _ .	As they migrate, butterflies and moths choose the winds they want to fly with, and they change their body positions if they start floating in the wrong direction. This new finding suggests that insects may use some of the same methods that birds use for traveling long distances. Scientists have long thought that insects were simply at the mercy of the wind. Fascinating as their skills of flight are, migrating behavior has been difficult to study in insects because many long distant trips happen thousands of feet above ground. Only recently have scientists developed technologies that can detect such little creatures at such great heights. To their surprise, though, the insects weren't passive travelers on the winds. In autumn, for example, most light winds blew from the east, but the insects somehow sought out ones that carried them south and they positioned themselves to navigate directly to their wintering homes. Even in the spring, when most winds flowed northward, the insects didn't always go with the flow. If breezes weren't blowing in the exact direction they wanted to go, the insects changed their body positions to compensate(, ). Many migrating birds do the same thing. The study also found that butterflies and moths actively flew within the air streams that pushed them along. By adding flight speeds to wind speeds, the scientists calculated that butterflies and moths can travel as fast as 100 kilometers an hour. The findings may have real-world applications. With climate warming, migrating insects are growing in number. Knowing how and when these pests move could help farmers decide when to spray their crops.	['insects were just blown about by the wind']

What did the gunman do after the massive killing?	"All 20 children who died in a shooting at a school in Connecticut were aged between six and seven, according to an official list of the dead. The state's chief medical examiner said the gunman used a rifle as his main weapon, and all the victims appeared to have been shot several times. The gunman, named in media reports as Adam Lanza, killed his mother before driving to the school and opening fire. Six adults, all women, were also killed before the gunman shot himself dead. The head teacher at Sandy Hook school in Newtown, Dawn Hochsprung, is listed among the dead, along with adults Rachel DaVino, Anne Marie Murphy, Lauren Russo, Mary Sherlach and Victoria Soto. Eight boys and 12 girls were killed - all but four of them were aged six. The youngest, Noah Pozner, celebrated his birthday only last month. A woman who worked at the school was the only person to be shot and survive. Scores of people have left flowers at a memorial outside the school, and on Saturday evening hundreds attended a candlelight vigil . President Barack Obama is to visit Newtown on Sunday to meet families and speak at an interfaith vigil at the town's high school.

In which section of a newspaper can we most likely to read the passage?	"In the gym of Croxteth Community School, Liverpool, 50 boys have completed a course on boxing that is seen as a pilot for its return to state schools. The Schools Amateur Boxing Association (SABA) has developed the Kid Gloves scheme ( ),a -non-contact version of the sport where outside coaches teach a range of basic skills. Chris Andrews, assistant secretary of the SABA, said the scheme was regarded as a way of changing the decline in boxing in state schools which began 25 years ago. Safety fears and the poor image of professional boxing had accelerated the sport's decline. Concern was worsened by incidents such as the death of the professional boxer Bradley Stone. But the Croxteth example was winning more supporters. Mr. Andrews said the idea was particularly well received in the north-east of England. ""The interest shown so far has been enormous,"" he said. ""I believe that boxing will come back into schools. A video has been produced to promote boxing in schools, and a bid has been made for a Sports Council grant ."" He said, ""I think there is a genuine recognition that there are aspects to boxing, if it is controlled and properly run, that really are very beneficial for children. This scheme takes away the dangers. I hope boxing can be promoted throughout the country in a more coordinated way."" Such an idea horrifies such groups as the British Medical Association (BMA) and the British Safety Council, both critics of the idea. Dr Jeffrey Cundy, the joint author of a BMA report on boxing, accepted that the scheme in Liverpool was non-contact, but he was still opposed. He said, ""We feel that children should still not be introduced to boxing, because they will then be encouraged to take up an activity which is uniquely dangerous when actual contact takes place."" He added, ""There is a whole range of sports which will teach the discipline that comes from boxing without the dangers. We see this reintroduction in schools as an unhealthy development."" At the 800-pupil Croxteth school, Steve Stewart, head of PE, said boxing had helped to improve self-confidence, self-discipline, self-awareness and self-respect in those taking part. Everybody could get involved and, because all were starting from scratch, the improvements could be quickly seen. Certificates were presented to the pupils at the end of the course by Paul Hodgkinson, a local boxer who is a former world champion. Next year, the course will be repeated and if possible girls will be allowed to take part following requests from them. Gerry Thompson and Tony Curry, both 12,have enjoyed the boxing sessions and say they will both join a local boxing club. ""I thought it was brilliant,"" said Gerry. ""I would rather be a professional boxer than a footballer. It's more enjoyable*"""	['Education']
What will the following part of this passage talk about?	"You've bought what you need. The grocery cashier asks, ""Will that be paper or plastic? You reply ""Plastic, please."" This seems like a simple question and there are plenty of reasons we choose plastic: easier to carry, lighter than paper bags, possibly less damaging to the environment, less expensive to the shop owners, able to be used as trash bag, and so on. There are different opinions on plastic and paper. Now let's follow the travels of 3 plastic bags. It begins at the grocery store with the customer's choice. Plastic Bag 1: As the waste engineer come by and pick up the trash, the first plastic bag falls out. It sits on a small street for a couple of hours until a car comes along and takes it down to the road. Then a gust of wind blows it across the road, then another car, then another gust of wind finally makes its way to the beach. Water fills the plastic bag and makes it look like a jellyfish. A seal swims by, thinking it looks very interesting, and swallowed it. The plastic bag may stay in the seal's stomach for months, maybe years. You see, our lovely animals have been living thousands of years in a world where everything can be eaten. Plastic Bag 2: This bag does make its way to landfill . Before they have a chance to cover up the thousands of pounds of daily waste, a strong wind comes up and blows these plastic bags out of the landfill. Once the wind stops, workers will be sent to collect thousands of bags around. But they can't possibly get them all. So our little bag continues his adventure getting caught in trees, eaten by birds or making its way to our lakes or rivers. Plastic Bag 3: The last bag also blows away but is caught in a landfill where it sits for many years, as all the trash is wrapped in a big plastic bag, making natural degradation impossible. Although workers do much work to make sure water and air system won't be polluted, some do. Guess what, plastic bags are made from petrol, a harmful waste material, which in one way or another makes its way to the environment. Another problem with putting plastic bags in out trash is that our landfills for most cities may be filled in about 20 years. More importantly, since we are running out of land to build homes, you might have the pleasure of one day living on top of your plastic bags! One of the best suggestions is not to use a bag at all or bring your own cloth bags. If you must, please choose paper bags, which, though not suggested, can be eaten by animals. And there are more opportunities recycle paper bags. It does take a little extra effort. But please have a thought about the little seal next time you say, ""Plastic please."""

What do we learn about Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe from the passage?	The pen is more powerful than the sword. There have been many writers who use their pens to write things that were wrong. Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe was one of them. She was born in the U. S. A. in 1811. One of her books not only made her famous but has been described as one that excited the world, and was helpful in causing a civil war and freeing the enslaved race. The civil war was the American Civil War of 1861, in which the Northern States fought the Southern States and finally won. This book that shook the world was called Uncle Tom's Cabin. There was a time when every English-speaking man, woman, and child had read this novel that did so much to stop slavery. Not many people read it today, but it is still very interesting, if only to show how a warm-hearted writer can arouse people's sympathies. The author herself had neither been to the Southern States nor seen a slave. The Southern Americans were very angry at the book, which they said did not at all represent the true state of affairs, but the Northern Americans were widely excited over it, and were so inspired by it that they were ready to go to war to set the slaves free.

What contributes most to the loss of medicinal plants?	"The health of millions could be at risk because medicinal plants are being used up.These plants are used to make traditional medicine,including drugs to fight cancer.""The loss of medicinal plants is a quiet disaster,""says Sara Oldfield,secretary general of the NGO Botanic Gardens Conservation International. Most people worldwide (including 80 percent of all Africans)rely on herbal medicines which are got mostly from wild plants.But some 15,000 of the 50,000 medicinal species are under threat of dying out,according to a report from the international conversation group Plantlife.Shortages have been reported in China,India,Kenya,Nepal,Tanzania and Uganda. Overharvesting does the most harm,though pollution and competition from invasive species are both responsible.""Businessmen generally harvest medicinal plants,not caring about sustain ability,""the Plantlife report says.""Damage is serious partly because they have no idea of it,but it is mainly because such collection is unorganized."" Medicinal trees at risk include the Himalayan yew and the African cherry,which are used to treat some cancers. The solution,says the report's author,Alan Hamilton,is to encourage local people to protect these plants.Ten projects studied by Plantlife in India,Pakistan,China,Nepal,Uganda and Kenya showed this method can succeed.In Uganda the project has kept a sustainable supply of lowcost cancer treatments,and in China a public run medicinal plant project has been created for the first time. ""Improving health,earning an income and keeping cultural traditions are important in encouraging people to protect medicinal plants,""says Hamilton.""You have to pay attention to what people are interested in."" Ghillean Prance,the former director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London,agrees that medicinal plants are in need of protection. ""Not nearly enough is being done,""he told New Scientist.""We are destroying the very plants that are of most use to us."""	['Improper harvesting.']
What's the writer's purpose of writing the passage?	"I learned about life from an ant farm. When I was seven years old, my family created one. First, we put clean sand in a thin glass box and put the ants into it. Soon they got to work making tunnels. I was amazed that each one knew exactly what to do. With my mom's help, I kept a record of what happened each day and named the ants. One day when I had put my face close to the structure (building), accidentally I knocked it over, and all the tunnels fell in. Although the ants survived their earthquake, one by one they began to die. I was frightened as I watched them give up their tunnel-building to carry the bodies to a corner of the farm. My mother reported that the ants were dying of ""frustration "". They simply could not stand the reality that their tunnels had been destroyed. Although much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Over the years, I came to realize the ants have the spirit of teamwork. Working together, they were able to create an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. Day in and day out, each worked at their task. The ant farm showed that teamwork and perseverance are indeed the keys to success. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently --Adversity is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, humans cannot give up when they face disappointment. So I try to live my life like those hardworking ants. But, unlike them, I try not to let frustration defeat me. I will have to keep building my tunnels."	['To share a personal experience.']
According to the passage, we can learn that the first bike was _ for him.	"My bike was a three-speed English ""racer"", purchased during my second year in college in November 1964 for $44. Most of the money was earned by myself in my spare time, but I had to get my mother to help me out a little. At that time, bikes were rare on a college campus. My reason for getting a bicycle was a little strange. A friend of mine convinced me to take a summer job selling door-to-door and suggested that I should use a bicycle to travel between houses. The job didn't work out, but was in my brain. That fall, I borrowed another student's bike and rode 45 miles on the first day, but his bike soon had a flat which he didn't like fixing. So I had to buy one. I immediately started using mine almost every day. Before getting the bike, I sometimes walked 28 miles to my parents' house. Now the bike gave me a quicker method, but my first trip took four hours due to strong headwinds that had me fight for every foot. Once I made a trip of 100 miles in one day. I decided to use the bike to go camping in the Smokies. During the trip, I recognized the need for handlebars and more gears, so I bought a ten-speed after just one year though I loved this bike. The first bike ""hung around"" for a couple of years, and then I gave it to my sister's kids who let it become part of their lives."	['very useful']
According to Carlos Pardo, _ .	"World Car Free Day is a very important day on the environmental calendar. Every September 22, governments, green groups and ordinary citizens stress the damage cars are doing to the earth. The day is a reminder that we do not need to rely so much on cars. Those who take part in the activity hope that we all should realize we do not have to accept our car-controlled society. Carlos Pardo from Colombia's Sustainable Urban Transport Project said, ""World Car Free Day is not only a celebration of fun ways to get around the city, but a demonstration of traffic-free streets and clean air is possible. But we do not want just one day of celebration and then a return to normal life. When people get out of their cars, they should stay out of their cars. It is up to us, our cities and our governments to help create lasting change to benefit walkers, cyclists and other people who do not drive cars. "" Car-free days were organized as early as during the 1970s, and several car-free days were organized in European cities during the early 1990s. An international car-free day was organized in Europe in 1999. The European Union adopted the idea in 2000. Today, as many as 100 million people in over 1500 cities worldwide celebrate this day. World Car Free Day aims to take a large number of cars off the streets for all or part of a day. This will give people a chance to see what their town might look like with fewer cars. But some people say it is a one-day trick and does not make people give up their cars for the rest of the year. They say what is needed is a move towards a more sustainable city transportation system."	['each day should be like World Car Free Day']
Did the girl's family have a lot of money?	"I watched a little girl playing basketball every day from my bedroom window. One day, I asked her why she practiced so much. She said, ""I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship . I like basketball and I want to be the best player in college. My dad told me, ""If the dream is big enough, the facts don't count."" She never changed her mind. Whenever she was in junior high school or senior high school. One day, before she graduate from senior high school, I saw her sitting on the grass sadly. I asked her what was wrong. She told me that her coach said she was too short to be a good basketball player, so she should stop dreaming about going to college. She was heartbroken and it made me feel bad, too. Then she smiled and told me her father said to her, ""If you really want to play for the scholarship of a good college, nothing but yourself can stop your dream."" The next year, she and her team went to a big game she was seen by a coach of a famous college team and was offered a scholarship to the women's basketball team of their college. She was getting the college education that she had dreamed of. ""If the dream is big enough, the facts don't count."" It is true."	"[""No, it didn't.""]"
What does the writer mainly want to tell us?	"Nearly all kids have had the same experience. They are eating in a restaurant with their parents. They finished the spaghetti minutes ago. Now, they are bored. Their little brother is kicking them under the table. He is also complaining about the desserts . Yet their parents are still eating and talking...and talking...and talking. ""Be patient."" One parent says. ""We'll have dessert soon."" All kids know what happens next. After dessert, their parents drink coffee. Then they talk some more. Again, the children must wait. They have been in school all day and would rather be running and playing. Instead, they must sit in a chair and stare at a wall. Going to a restaurant doesn't have to be this way. Many restaurants say they are ""family-friendly"". Family restaurants, such as fast-food restaurants should play areas for children. At these restaurants, almost every play area is a big room full of climbing equipment. The room is usually, packed with happy kids. Parents can eat while the children play. Everyone is happy. The real problem begins when families want to eat a fancier meal . The parents don't want to hurry through the meal but talk to each other. They do not have bored children pestering them about leaving. That's no fun for kids either. For them, going to a nicer restaurant means just one thing: sit still and be quiet. On family blogs across the Web, dozens of parents post the same question all the time; are there any nicer restaurants with play areas for kids? Research shows that some nicer restaurants do have play areas. In warmer cities, it is easier for restaurants to build play areas outside. For example, at one restaurant kids can sail tiny little motor boats in a small, shallow pond. Parents can sit on a beautiful yard and watch the kids play. Some nicer restaurants even have indoor play areas. Research also shows that these restaurants serve more than just burgers, chickens and fries. So, it's possible for a restaurant to provide both food and a place where kids can play. These restaurants seem to be popular, too. For some, families must have reservation days in advance. For others, families might be forced to wait in long lines. Clearly, quality food and safe play areas are both good for business."	['Restaurants are supposed to give kids some space.']
Diet products indirectly harm people physically because such products _ .	"Diet Coke, diet Pepsi, diet pills, no-fat diet, vegetable diet... We are surrounded by the word ""diet"" everywhere we look and listen. We have so easily been attracted by the promise and potential of diet products that we have stopped thinking about what diet products are doing to us. We are paying for products that harm us psychologically and physically. Diet products significantly weaken us psychologically. On one level, we are not allowing our brain to admit that our weight problems lie not in actually losing the weight, but in controlling the consumption of fatty, high-calorie, unhealthy foods. Diet products allow us to jump over the thinking stage and go straight for the scale instead. All we have to do is to swallow or recognize the word ""diet"" in food labels. On another level, diet products have greater psychological effects. Every time we have a zero-calorie drink, we are telling ourselves without our awareness that we don't have to work to get results. Diet products make people believe that _ , and that life can be without resistance and struggle. The danger of diet products lies not only in the psychological effects they have on us, but also in the physical harm that they cause. Diet foods can indirectly harm our bodies because consuming them instead of healthy foods means we are preventing our bodies from having basic nutrients . Diet foods and diet pills contain zero calorie only because the diet industry has created chemicals to produce these wonder products. Diet products may not be nutritional, and the chemical that go into diet products are potentially dangerous. Now that we are aware of the effects that diet products have on us, it is time to seriously think about buying them. Losing weight lies in the power of minds, not in the power of chemicals. Once we realize this, we will be much better able to resist diet products, and therefore prevent the psychological harm that comes from using them ."	['lack basic nutrients']
What can we learn from the passage?	"The 18-meter-tall Rubber Duck arrived in Beijing on Friday. It was placed on waters in the International Garden Expo Park, where the Yongding River passes through. The Rubber Duck exhibition was designed by Dutch artist, Florentijn Hofman. It was part of the activities of Beijing Design Week, which ran from September 26 to October 3 in 2013. The Rubber Duck stayed in the park until September 23, then moved to the Summer Palace, a famous Beijing tourist spot, where it was on display until October 26. The duck is made of over 200 pieces of rubber. It was guarded not only by staff, but also by 10 volunteers wearing yellow T-shirts and hats with a rubber duck logo. Sun Yidong, a volunteer who guided visitors to the duck, said the art brought energy to the traditional Chinese park. ""Seeing the giant Rubber Duck makes me feel like I'm a kid again."" Sun said. Because of the rain on Friday, there were not too many people coming to see it. The Expo workers said they expected more people to come and visit the duck on weekends. Zhao Yan said she had been following news about the duck since 2007, when the duck began its journey. ""I even considered going to Hong Kong to see it. It's great that the duck is in Beijing,"" Zhao said. Before arriving in Beijing, the Rubber Duck traveled to 13 cities in nine countries. ""The aim of the Rubber Duck is simply to bring everyone back to their childhood again,"" said Zeng Hui, a leader of the Beijing Design Week Organizing Committee Office. ""It can be a toy for adults."" ,."	['The Rubber Duck can remind people of their childhood.']
In Godwin's opinion, children should be encouraged to _ .	"Many parents take on the role of being their children's preschool teacher and the responsibility of readying them for kindergarten. To achieve this goal, it is important for parents to introduce a variety of subjects in a positive and playful manner. ""Learning should not be forced,""says Marion Godwin, who has taught first grade in Moorestown, N. J. for more than 30 years."" It should be taught according to what they know and do best--and that is' play'. When teaching them, play games and have fun with the subject. And parents should always be looking for'teachable moments'."" ""You want a child to be a lifelong learner, so you want to show them learning is everywhere,""she says.""If parents take the time to lay a strong educational foundation, their children will keep building on it."" Introduce children to science with hands-on activities that interest them, such as growing plants from seeds, discussing animals and how to care for pets, and observing the chemical changes that occur during cooking"", she says. ""Sorting activities, simple patterns and counting games are a great way to teach children the basics of math, and taking them on field trips, singing songs and reciting rhymes also are ways to prepare them for the first day of school"", she says. ""I think children are naturals when it comes to computers,"" she says.""Let them play educational games on the computer and teach them how to type their first names using the keyboard. When they are more familiar with using the computer, let them find pictures of animals and places on the web. "" ""Don't criticize the child,"" she says. ""You can't force them to learn something. If they don't get something right, so what? Smile and be happy and make the experience joyful. Parents need to understand that if a child gets something wrong, they may think something is wrong with them. Keep working with them and when they get the right answer make sure you tell them how hard they worked to get the correct answer. """	['learn online under instructions']

Which of the following NOT right according to the passage?	"It is difficult to say exactly how the music we call ""rock"" or ""rock and roll"" began. Its roots go back to many different countries and many different kinds of music and many musicians. Rock music developed mainly from the interaction of black African and white European music. The Europeans and the African slaves who came to America during the seventeenth century each had their own different kinds of music. Black Africans used heavy drumbeats,a rough singing voice,and the calling of a melody and answer of a chorus. The white Europeans,mostly English and Scots,used a stronger melody,a less heavy beat,and instruments such as guitars,horns,and fiddles. The history of rock and roll is the history of how rock changed from these two traditions. From the seventeenth to the twentieth century, musicians in the southern United States developed two new forms of music: the blues,usually played by blacks,and country music, played by whites. Black musicians sang the blues with a guitar. This music was similar to work songs:stories of troubles and pain, with lines that were repeated several times. The word ""rock and roll"" probably came from the black churches in the South, where people sang and danced to the strong rhythms, which they called ""rocking and reeling"". At the same time, whites were playing country music, which was mostly traditional dancing music and slow songs that told sad stories. The singers played with string instruments such as fiddles and guitars. During this time blues and country musicians had some influence on each other, but the influence grew stronger after phonograph records became popular in the late nineteenth century. The birth of the electric guitar changed country and blue music in the 1940s. The sound of the electric guitar would become the sound, of rock and roll. No one thinks of early rock and roll without thinking of Elvis Presley,the""King of Rock and Roll"".Rock music continues to develop and change, but the heart and soul of rock is the same heart and soul that Elvis expressed."

In the writer's opinion, _ .	Is war unavoidable? Can war be prevented? History tells that there were wars, great or small, in every century, in every decade. Throughout the ages, from the Stone age to the Atomic Age, men have been fighting, first with swords and shields , then with guns and cannons, and now, hydrogen bombs and missiles are used for military purpose. But, in spite of all these, it is still my belief that war can be prevented and peace can be won, but it requires the effort of every one of us. I am sure that we would not like to experience another world war. If it ever happens, two-thirds of the world and much of the civilization which men have gained through time, patience and effort will be destroyed. Will then the remaining one-third of the world be able to survive on its own? Our task now is not to blame the past, but to plan for the future. If there is peace in the world, men can use their rockets to explore the mystery of space, their submarines to explore the depth of the sea, their missiles to deliver mails and their fine equipment to penetrate the jungles of Africa, instead of using them military. Governments can use their money to build more schools, so that more children can be educated to be useful citizens. Scientists can use atomic energy to propel steamships and planes. They can also design new machines to increase the production of goods and thus improve the way of living of the people. How can a peaceful world be achieved? It requires, in my opinion, the understanding and friendship between all people from all nations. Let no one suffer discrimination by reason of color, race, religion, or national origin. Let the rich support the poor and the strong help the weak. We know that neither peace nor such a dream world can come true in a day or a month. It may even take decades or centuries. But let us plan and begin now.	['peace can be won through the efforts of all human beings']
Abraham Lincoln couldn't go to school because _ .	"When Abraham Lincoln was just a boy, he had to help his father to look after their farm.

What is the basic reason for poaching?	"When you think of environmental problems you probably think of pollution, but the poaching of wild animals is one, too. Poaching has worried environmentalists for years and, despite laws, this terrible crime has yet to be stopped. Poaching is a serious problem, especially in Africa and Asia. This crime is done for commercial profit , meaning hunters kill animals illegally and sell their most worthy parts. Although poachers usually hunt tigers, elephants and rhinos, they kill sharks and whales, too. This illegal hunting has led to decreasing populations of many species. Many nations have banned poaching, but enforcement is difficult. The small number of police officers trained to deal with this creates an unfair advantage for poachers. Poachers usually kill animals for only one product: tigers are killed for their striped fur, elephants their ivory tusks and rhinos their large horn. The bodies of the animals are left to rot. Sharks' fins are cut off and their bodies thrown back into the ocean. Without fins they can't swim and will die. The illegally obtained fins are used to make shark fin soup. The laws that ""protect"" animals are no more than pieces of paper. The current poaching bans need better enforcement, and I have a plan. The number of enforcers needs to be increased so that there are enough to watch the herds and make sure poachers can't shoot the animals. The reserve parks in Africa should become a huge zoo so that the animals can move but within a fenced area. Another idea is to build a concrete enclosure instead of fences. Watchtowers could be constructed so enforcers can monitor a wide variety of poacher targets. This may not completely end the problem, but it would slow it down. Poaching is a serious problem and a criminal act. The effects of poaching will be felt for centuries to come, and if there are any still alive, the only place to see animals might be in a zoo."	"[""People's desire for profit.""]"
The main topic of this passage is _ .	"""Racism is a grown-up disease,"" declares the saying on Ruby Bridge's website along with a photo of Mrs. Bridge today, a 6-year-old girl four decades ago. In the photo, she is walking up the steps of the William Frantz Public School in New Orleans, a little black girl accompanied by two officers who protect her on her way to school. Her name then was Ruby Nell. It was Nov. 14, 1960. She was the first black child to enroll at this all-white elementary school according to the court order to desegregate in New Orleans schools. Her story is moving -- she was a very courageous child -- and remains a significant proof against intolerance of all kinds. Ruby's photo brings out another powerful image on her website: Norman Rockwells symbolic painting for Look magazine on Jan. 14, 1964, ""The Problem We All Live With."" Rockwell was an illustrator of exceptional skill and charm. He produced a vast number of unforgettable images over a long career, many of them involving children. His American kids are innocent and appealing, but often, at the same time, decidedly naughty. His method was to photograph his models, and the resulting paintings were photographic. But it is revealing to see how the artist slightly changed facial expressions from photo to oil painting in order to make his paintings communicate with the viewer. Communication, even persuasion, lay at the back of his work; this was art for effect. ""The Problem We All Live With"" belongs to Rockwell's later work, when he began openly showing his strong belief in liberty. This is a highly persuasive image. Before he arrived at the final copy, one sketch shows the little girl closer to the two officers following her than to those in front. In the finished picture, the girl seems more determined, independent, and untouched. The unfriendly tomatoes thrown on the wall are behind her now, and she, is completely unaffected."

Even so, we packed up our old computer and delivered it to my parents' home. And so began my mother's adventure in the world of computers. It also marked the beginning of an unusual teaching task for me. I've taught people of all ages, but I never thought I would be teaching my mother how to do anything. She has been the one teaching me all my life; to cook and sew; to enjoy the good times and put up with the bad. Now it was my turn to give something back. It wasn't easy at the beginning. There was so much to explain and to introduce. Slowly but surely, my mother caught on, making notes in a little notebook. After a few months of Scrabble and other games, I decided it was time to introduce her to word processing . This proved to be a bigger challenge to her, so I gave her some homework. I asked her to write me a letter, using different letter types, colors and spaces. ""Are you demanding this with your kindergarten pupils?"" she said. ""No, of course not,"" I said. ""They already know how to use a computer."" My mother isn't the only one experiencing a fast personal growth period. Thanks to the computer, my father has finally got over his phone allergy .

What is the author's attitude towards Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?	When I was a kid, my only interest was watching television. But now, my interest is reading, thanks to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone, the first book I ever read that inspired me to read. This wonderful book pulled me in with its adventure. It's about a boy, Harry Potter, who discovers he's a wizard . After this, his life becomes full of uncertainty. He starts his new school and makes two best friends. Then Voldemort, the man who killed Harry's parents, comes to steal the stone that will extend his life. The three bravely defeat the bad guy. This was a life-changing book for me. After finishing it, I really started to enjoy reading. Ever since then, I don't ever put a book down before I'm finished with it. When I read a book, it inspires me and shows me a different world. It makes me excited. When I read, I never get bored. Books can also change my state of mind. Regardless of whether I'm angry, depressed, or stressed, a book will make me happy. Books took me out of my comfort zone. Since I started reading, I have learned that even if I'm not comfortable with something, I should try it out. It might turn out to be something I love doing. It might even become another one of my interests. Interest is a factor that can turn a job into a career. Hopefully, one day, I will get my dream job at a publishing house. Then, my interest would become my life, and I would have lived my life to its fullest.	['Grateful.']
Which part will change more when a person studies a second language?	"If English means endless new words, difficult grammar and sometimes strange pronunciation, you are wrong. Haven't you noticed that you have become smarter since you started to learn a language? According to a new study by a British university, learning a second language can lead to an increase in your brain power. Researchers found that learning other languages changes grey matter. This is the area of the brain which processes information. It is similar to the way that exercise builds muscles. The study also found the effect is greater the younger people learn a second language. A team led by Dr Andrea Mechelli, from University College London, took a group of Britons who only spoke English. They were compared with a group of ""early _ "" who had learnt a second language before the age of five, as well as a number of later learners. Scans showed that grey matter density in the brain was greater in bilinguals than in people without a second language. But the longer a person waited before mastering a new language, the smaller the difference. "" _ ""said the scientists. It means that the change itself increases the ability to learn. Professor Dylan Vaughan Jones of the University of Wales, has researched the link between bilingualism and math skills. ""Having two languages gives you two windows on the world and makes the brain more flexible ,"" he said. ""You are actually going beyond language and have a better understanding of different ideas."" The findings were matched in a study of native Italian speakers who had learned English as a second language between the ages of two and 34. Reading, writing, and comprehension were all tested. The results showed that the younger they started to learn, the better. ""Studying a language means you get an entrance to another world,"" explained the scientists."	['grey matter density']

As the cards change from one to the other, her gaze starts to lose its focus - until a third, with three black spots, is presented. Her gaze returns; she looks at it for twice as long as she did at the previous card. Can she tell that the number two is different from three, just 24 hours after coming into the world? Or do newborns simply prefer more to fewer? The same experiment, but with three spots shown before two, shows the same return of interest when the number of spots changes. Perhaps it is just the newness? When slightly older babies were shown cards with pictures of objects(a comb, a key, an orange and so on), changing the number of objects had an effect separate from changing the objects themselves. Could it be the pattern that two things make, as opposed to three? No again. Babies paid more attention to squares moving randomly on a screen when their number changed from two to three, or three to two. The effect even crosses between senses. Babies who were repeatedly shown two spots became more excited when they then heard three drumbeats than when they heard just two; likewise when the researchers started with drumbeats and moved to spots.

What's the author's attitude towards the autopilot?	Did you know that there are actually people who have paid for a flight to the moon? In the future, there will be a lot more opportunities to travel to faraway places than now... perhaps even as far as the moon. As people adventure further and further away and as planes, trains, cars, and rocket ships become faster, is it safer to have these vehicles controlled by humans or by computers? While many flights by plane are controlled automatically by machines, most people today wouldn't let their car drive itself. That's because currently the autopilot function on your car can only keep it on the same course you are travelling on. It won't turn the car right or left. It won't stop if an animal jumps in the way. However, cars today can sense when something is too close and warn the driver with flashing lights and alarms. Many cars also have GPS(global positioning systems) that tell drivers which road to take and when to turn. These systems, unlike human drivers, never get lost. In the future, it is easy to believe that your car will be better able to drive itself with the aid of computers that can determine the position of your car and the speed it should travel at. In addition to computers being 'smarter' than people regarding the best way to go or knowing how close another vehicle is, computers don't get sick, tired, or angry. This means they won't make the same mistakes that people make when they are not having a good day. While responding with emotion is a good thing when choosing the best way to deal with a friend's personal problem, it may not be such a good thing when deciding what to do at the wheel of a fast-moving vehicle. So what are the disadvantages of autopilot systems? Maybe one disadvantage is that a small computer problem could cause a serious accident. It could also be argued that in unexpected situations, computers might not be able to respond appropriately; some decisions require human emotions. Another problem might be that if everything were controlled by computers or robots, people wouldn't have any jobs.	['Objective.']
Why was the other lady crying when the author was there?	"Yesterday I went to the nursing home to visit my step mom's grandma. When I got there she was happy to see me. Then I heard a woman crying. It was my great grandma's roommate. The curtain was drawn so I could not see her. She started calling out a name that wasn't mine but she was definitely talking to me, begging me to go to her side of the room. Then she started begging and saying, ""Please, come see me!"" So I went to see her. She looked so old and weak but flashed me the biggest smile! She opened her arms wide for me to hug her so I bent low and gave her a hug. Then I sat on her bed and talked with her for a few minutes. She kept calling me by the other name but I did not correct her. She told me stories like I had been there when they happened. Eventually I went back to visit with my great grandma. Then the other woman started crying again, saying, ""Please, come back."" I stopped by the nurse's station and the nurse told me that the lady was suffering from Alzheimer's. I mentioned the name she had called me. The nurse told me it was the lady's daughter's name. It was a heartbreaking experience but it gave me a new perspective on life. We will all get old someday.Some of us will have broken minds like my great grandma's roommate and some of us will have broken bodies like my great grandma.But what was beautiful was the fact that both ladies,one 86 and the other 90,did not have broken spirits.As I was leaving I promised I would go back and visit the lady,even after my great grandma moves back to her home state."

""" He settled for some biscuits ""(in Paragraph 3)means that Tim _ ."	The house was quiet at 5 am and Tim's mother was asleep. Only the sound of the big freezer broke the quiet. He'd dreamt of the cave last night. The purring of the freezer had been the sea . Tim pulled on a sweater and put some apples into his schoolbag. It was too early for breakfast. He'd eat after he'd been through the cave, sitting on the rocks and staring at the sea. He wished he had a proper pack. His schoolbag would have to do. What else? Sandwiches--but his mother might wake up if he started pulling out bread for sandwiches, she'd want to know why he had to leave so early. , and left a note stuck to the table: Gone to Michael's. Back tonight. Tim. The sky was high and soft and light outside, though the sun still wasn't up. Even the highway up the hill was quiet as he made his way down the street. The wind from the sea was fresh and sweet. The sandhills still breathed heat from yesterday's sun, though the top of the sand was cool. He ran down to the beach impatiently, but there was no one, just dry sand dancing in the early wind and seabirds marching up and down watching the waves. The light changed suddenly. The first rays of sunlight stretched across the sea . The sun was pushing its way over the edge of the world. Over the first rocks, along to the point. Tim glanced back. The beach was still empty. The sun sailed higher in the sky. He could see the cave now, even darker in the morning light. The sand turned silver then dark gold as the water flowed away from it. He had to force himself to go closer. Why was it so much more mysterious now ? But it would be silly to go back now after so much trouble. He needn't go in all the way ...

Reading people's character from their ears is _ .	The size and shape of your ears show your character more than any other part of the face. Other parts of the face change shapes as we get older, but ears do not change their shapes. They only change in size. Reading people's character from their ears is a very old science. In the past people thought that a person's ears with color was dangerous. They also thought that the shape of the ears showed if a person was musical or not. Today,too many people believe that the size and shape of the ears help you know if a person is musical. Ears are all different,and each different thing has a meaning. Next time you look at a person,see if his or her ears are large,medium-size,or small. Look at the lobes .Do they stick to the face? Ears that are always red mean that a person may get angry easily. Ears that are always cold and nearly white color mean that a person has a nervous character.	['an old idea']
What did the old soldiers do more than 70 years ago?	"When we interviewed what the life was like more than 70 years ago, many old soldiers were full of tears in their eyes. They told us that they never forgot those days when they were in the army, during which they lived hard lives but spared no effort to fight against the enemies. Now in the year 2015 comes the first great parade in the 21stcentury. September 3rdis the 70thanniversary of the victory of the anti-fascist war. This day is considered as an important moment for China, as well as the world. 49 countries from all over the world, including South Korea and some European countries attended this special occasion. In preparation for the parade, the soldiers worked hard every day. In order to walk well in the three hundred meters distance on the Tian'anmen Square, they had to receive extremely strict training. Each day, they got up early in the morning and started the 10 hours' practice. When a reporter arrived, it was raining heavily outside, but none of the soldiers stopped training. Nothing can stop their training, and no one can stop their deep love to their motherland. The reporter asked, ""The training is so hard but why does nobody give up?"" ""It's the first time for me to join in such an important ceremony. I consider it a great honor. I must try my best."" One of the participants answered. In fact, everyone takes pride in taking part in this big parade because they want to show the spirit of Chinese army, the power of Chinese army, as well as the determination of keeping the world in peace. From the soldiers, we learned the power of dreams. If one has a dream, he will get over any difficulties that get in the way to make the dream come true."	['They took part in a war.']
What can we learn about the two storms that the tree has survived?	"I am in my father's house in Connecticut, sitting at a crowded table with my brother, my two sisiters and all our partners, talking about a tree. ""He doesn't want it cut down."" My sister says when my father has gone to bed and none of us speaks of the tree in his presence. ""He says he usef to climb it when he was a boy."" When I was last here, a year and a half ago, for my father's 90th birthday, Hurricane Irene drove seawater into the roads. The large tree that hangs over the houses swayed alarmingly, but it stayed up. Last October, Hurricane Sandy acused a great deal of damage. Six months on, many of the surrounding houses are on sale, but the tree that hangs over the house still stands. ""That tree,"" my brother says, ""has survived the two worst storms of the last 100 years."" Though my brother thinks highly of the amazing staying power of the tree, my sister says that the tree should never have been planted: it stops light from reaching the house. My other sister's partner says that all trees fall down eventually. There is plenty of evidence for what he says: throughout the neighborhood, the ramains of similarly sized trees lie on their sides, with their roots in the air. During this discussion, I offer to pay a quarter of whatever is required to remove the tree. ""A guy I talked to,"" my brother says, ""told me it could cost us$10,000."" As night wears on, the discussion becomes increaslingly meaningless. There is no point in reaching any kind of agreement, since the decision is not for us to make. It's my father's tree, and he has refused to cut down the only thing in the neighborhood older than him."	['They were the two worst storms of the last 100 years.']
What should parents do for their children based on Dweck's study?	"Make Up Your Mind to Succeed Kind-hearted parents have unknowingly left their children defenseless against failure. The generation born between 1980 and 2001 grew up playing sports where scores and performance were played down because ""everyone's winner."" And their report cards sounded more positive than ever before. As a result, Stanford University professor Carol Dweck, PhD, calls them ""the overpraised generation."" Dweck has been studying how people deal with failure for 40 years. Her research has led her to find out two clearly different mind-sets that have a great effect on how we react to it. Here's how they work: A fixed mind-set is grounded in the belief that talent is genetic - you're a born artist, point guard, or numbers person. The fixed mind-set believes it's sure to succeed without much effort and regards failure as personal shame. When things get difficult, it's quick to blame, lie, and even stay away from future difficulties. On the other hand, a growth mind-set believes that no talent is entirely heaven-sent and that effort and learning make everything possible. Because the ego isn't on the line as much, the growth mind-set sees failure as a chance rather than shame. When faced with a difficulty, it's quick to rethink, change and try again. In fact, it enjoys this experience. We are all born with growth mind-sets. (Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to live in the world.) But parents, teachers, and instructors often push us into fixed mind-sets by encouraging certain actions and misdirecting praise. Dweck's book, Mind-set: The New Psychology of Success, and online instructional program explain this in depth. But she says there are many little things you can start doing today to make sure that your children, grandchildren and even you are never defeated by failure."

While speaking in English, a foreigner seems _ .	"So there you are on the phone, you ask a question, and suddenly there's silence. What is this, the phone's gone dead, the person you're talking to is dead? Possibly. But there could be another reason -- the other person could be Finnish, or Japanese. According to a handy new booklet from British Telecom (BT) for business people, in countries such as Britain and Italy ""conversation is a form of entertainment. There is a continuous flow of talk..."". But in other countries especially Finland and Japan, ""it is not only impolite to break in, but listeners will think over what has been said in silence"". It also points out that English, when spoken by foreigners, is likely to include plenty of ""false friends"", where word-for-word translation fails. If a Frenchman says something is ""interesting"", he probably means it's profitable.If he ""demands"" something, he's actually just asking. If an American says your proposal is ""quite good"", you should be pleased, because ""quite"" means ""very"". But if he tells you to ""table"" a proposal, then things are not good at all. Whereas an English person would understand tabling a proposal as putting an idea forward, to an American it means shelves it. According to the booklet, British people are not ""explicit"" like the Americans, the Dutch, the Germans or the French. ""If a Dutchman says an idea is interesting, he means that it is interesting. If an Englishman says it is interesting, you have to deduce from the way he says it whether he means it is a good or a bad idea."" The Japanese, the Russians and the Arabs on the other hand, live in the land of true dioplomatic subtlety .""If they say an idea is interesting, it may simply be out of politeness"". It is safest to stick with plain speaking whenever possible, BT advises its British readers. And whatever you do, be careful to limit the use of the famous British sense of humor."

From the story we know the parrot was _ .	"Once there was a parrot on sale in a pet store. It was a beautiful red and blue bird. It sat on a perch in the middle of the store, so that everyone could see it when they came in. The owner was very proud of it and asked a high price for it. One day a man went into the store. ""That's a beautiful bird,"" he said to the pet store owner, ""But why is it so expensive? Is it unusual bird?"" ""No, it's not very unusual. It's expensive because it can talk,"" the pet store owner said. ""I see. How can I make it talk?"" the man asked. The pet store owner asked him, ""Do you see those string tied to each of the bird's legs?"" ""Yes,"" the man answered. ""Well, you pull those strings,"" the pet store owner told him. ""That will make the parrot talk."" The man asked, ""Do you mind if I try?"" ""Not at all,"" the pet store owner said. The man walked up to the parrot and pulled the string on its left leg. The parrot said, ""Good morning."" The man pulled the string on the parrot's right leg. This time the parrot said, ""How are you today?"" ""That's not very interesting,"" said the man. ""Any parrot could do that."" Then he laughed, ""But what would happen if I pulled both strings at the same time?"" ""I'll fall off my perch, you fool!"" the parrot said."	['clever']
According to the passage, which of the following is WRONG?	"Local businessmen are increasingly facing competition from online retailers. Larry Pollock, owner of Camera Co/Op on South Congress, said he has been dealing with this kind of problem for years, even before the Internet. The struggle began with mail-order catalogues , which are similar to online retailers in that they have few employees to pay, no sales tax fees and no business venue to lease and manage. ""Their overhead is lower, but they don't offer a service like we do,"" Pollock said. Pollock, however, said providing a valuable service to customers does not always guarantee continued sales. ""We spend 30 minutes to an hour with somebody and they go home and buy it on line,"" he said. According to the state comptroller's office, online shopping is developing at a more rapid rate than traditional businesses. In spite of how fair or unfair online shopping may be to the local businessmen, consumers will continue to turn to the Internet for its variety and accessibility, said Mitch Wilson, an online shopper. ""You have a larger selection and it's easier to compare prices."" Wilson said he built his personal computer and paid a third of the price by shopping on line. ""Before the Internet, I would have had to go and buy an assembled computer from somebody like Dell,"" he said. ""Before I started shopping on line I could never find all the pieces I wanted. No single store had everything needed, so shopping on line saved me from having to buy from Dell."" Janny Brazeal, a psychology freshman, said online shopping is too impersonal. ""'d rather see it in person, touch it, know that I'm getting it,"" she said. Brazeal also said she would not give out her credit card number or other personal information on line no matter how safe the site claims it is."

What is Prof. Petford's belief according to the text?	"Tuition fees for British students could reach as much as #20,000, a university vicc-president has warned. Prof. Nick Pctfon warned that universities will face additional economic pressures as student numbers increase, which could force them to increase home students' fees. Student tuition is presently upped at #9,000 for British students. Speaking to the lines fligher Education, Prof. Petford, the vice-president of Northampton University,said that some universities with high brand value will be able to charge PS17,000, PS18,000 or PS20,000 in the future. ""'I am sure of that. The president of the National Union of Students Toni Pearce said: ""The suggestion that tuition fees should be charged at this level shows just how astonishingly out of touch some university vice-presidents can be."" Prof. Petford argued there will be a change in how universities view home students - suggesting they will be treated more like international students. ""If you look at international students, that's been a market not well-governed since we've been recruiting (tix) overseas students. Universities have always been used to this sort of behaviour."" He said. ""The big step change now is thinking about home students in this way."" Presently there is no cap on fees that universities can charge international students. The president of Universities UK, Christopher Snowden, said that his report showed universities needed more money to maintain their current standards. ""The rise in tuition fees in England did not give all universities extra money - it replaced the cuts in direct government funding , "" he said."

What food can make us more confident?	We all know that food makes us grow every day, but sometimes it can make us happy when we feel bad. Food such as sea fish, bananas, pumpkins and chicken can help us be happy. How can they affect our feelings? People living by the sea look much happier than other people, because the fresh sea air helps them clear their minds and they eat a lot of sea fish. Bananas have much Vitamin B6. Having more bananas can help us make a quick decision, and become more confident . Eating pumpkins can also help people get into a good feeling because it's rich in Vitamin B6 and iron . Are you in a bad mood ? If you are, don't sit alone. Go to eat such happy food with your friends. Maybe you'll feel better. ,. (5)	['Bananas.']
What is the best title for the text?	"What were you doing before you started reading this? Were you fully focused on another article? Or eating breakfast? Organizing your day? Or were you staring out of the window, feeling restless and bored? It is likely to have been the latter. Brief moments of boredom are universal, and are frequently what drives us to stop what we are doing and move to something that we hope will be more exciting. But although boredom is common, it is neither unimportant nor favorable, according to Dr John Eastwood, a psychologist at York University, Toronto. Eastwood is the joint author ofThe Unengaged Mind, a major new paper on the theory of boredom. Boredom, he points out in the paper, has been connected with overeating, depression, anxiety, and an increased risk of making mistakes. Mistakes at work might not be a matter of life and death for most of us, but if you are an air traffic controller, pilot or nuclear power plant operator, they most certainly can be. Commercial polo Sami Franks confirms that boredom can make pilots lose attention. ""When you fly a lengthy distance, there are two pilots, one of whom is monitoring all the screens while the other does the paperwork, talks to air traffic control and so on. You need to be alert for landing and takeoff, but once you're 500 ft above the runway, the plane's on autopilot and it can be very quiet and boring. In a study I saw of pilots who woke up after a short sleep. 30% of them reported seeing the other pilot asleep too,"" said Franks. However, Dr Esther Priyadharshini, a senior lecturer in education at the university of East Anglia, has studied boredom and says it can be seen in a positive light. ""We can't prevent boredom--it's an unavoidable human emotion. We have to accept it and find ways to control it. We all need downtime. There's no need to be fully busy with work at all times."" she says. Children who complain that they have nothing to do on rainy holidays may try to find other things to focus on. The artist Grayson Perry has reportedly spoken of how long periods of boredom in childhood may have improved his creativity. ""We all need vacant time to mull things over,"" says Priyadharshini."

. From the text we learn that _ .	"Have you ever heard an echo of your voice? An echo is a reflected sound. Stand in a very large, empty hall with nothing on the walls. Then shout. The sounds you make will hit the walls and come back to you. The walls reflect the sounds. These reflected sounds are called ""echoes"". We can use reflected sound to make sound travel farther. Hold a watch about fifty centimeters from your ear. You cannot hear it. The sound of the watch travels a short way in all directions. It does not travel as far as your ear. You can make it travel to your ear by using a roll of cardboard . Make the roll of cardboard about fifty centimeters long. Put one end over your ear and hold the watch at the other. Now you can hear the watch because the sound has not gone in all directions. It is reflected down the roll to your ear. A megaphone works in the same way. It makes sound travel farther. It reflects the sound into a beam which can travel a long way. In the ship, the sailor uses the megaphone to make his voice travel. Without the megaphone, his voice cannot travel far. We use reflected sound in many ways. We use it to measure the depth of the sea, for example. Among the animals, bats and whales use reflected sound to tell them where they are and what things are near them."	['bats use reflected sound to fly and get food']
What is the best title for the passage?	Nearly all our food comes from the soil. Some of us eat meat, of course, but animals live on plants. If there were no plants, we would have no animals and no meat. So the soil is very necessary for life. The top of the ground is usually covered with grass or other plants. There may be dead leaves and dead plants on the grass. The waste matter from animals also falls on it. All soil needs food. If we do not give it any, the plants will be weak. Farmers found that animals' waste is the best food for the soil, but chemical fertilizers are also very useful. The same crop should not be grown in the same place every year; it's better to have a different crop. A change of crop and the use of a good fertilizer will keep the land good.	['Soil and Food']
It can be inferred from the passage that in the writer's opinion, _ .	"My old digital camera broke down, so I wanted to buy a new one. Being the cautious type, I fancied a reliable brand. So I went on the Net, spent 15 minutes reading product reviews on good websites, wrote down the names of three top recommendations and headed for my nearest big friendly camera store. There in the cupboard was one of the cameras on my list. And it was on special offer. Oh joy. I pointed at it and asked an assistant, ""Can I have one of those? "" He looked perturbed . ""Do you want to try it first?"" he said. It didn't quite sound like a question. ""Do I need to?"" I replied, ""There's nothing wrong with it."" This made him look a bit offended and I started to feel bad. ""No, no. But you should try it,"" he said encouragingly, ""compare it with the others. I looked across at the others: shelves of similar cameras placed along the wall, offering a wide range of slightly different prices and discounts, with each company selling a range of models based around the same basic box. With so many models to choose from, it seemed that I would have to spend hours weighing X against Y, always trying to take Z and possibly H into account at the same time. But when I had finished, I would still have only the same two certainties that I had entered the store with: first, soon after I carried my new camera out of the shop, it would be worth half what I paid for it; and second, my wonderful camera would very quickly be replaced by a new model. But something in the human soul whispers that you can beat these traps by making the right choice, the clever choice, the wise choice. In the end, I agreed to try the model I had chosen. The assistant seemed a sincere man. So I let him take out my chosen camera from the cupboard, show how it took excellent pictures of my fellow shoppers... and when he started to introduce the special features, I interrupted to ask whether I needed to buy a carry-case and a memory card as well. Why do we think that new options still offer us anything new? Perhaps it is because they offer an opportunity to avoid facing the fact that our real choices in this culture are far more limited than we would like to imagine."

Why do the people think that Halloween is the children's New Year's Eve?	"Halloween is a festival on October 31st.The name of the holiday means --""hallowed"" because it comes the day before All Saints Day. Before the festival, people paint homes, shops and classrooms in the traditional Halloween colours, orange and black. Some people make costumes at home. Some people buy them in shops. People also make decorations for the festival. These decorations look like witches, black cats, ghosts, skeletons and jack-o-lanterns. Jack-o- lanterns are pumpkins that are cut to look like faces. People think that Halloween is the children's New Year's Eve. On that day children dress up in special costumes and masks. They eat too much, and go to bed very late after celebrating. They go from one door to another saying ""trick or treat"". People give them candies,cookies,fruit or money. Adults and older children also celebrate Halloween with parades ,festivals and costumes parties. One kind of the parties welcomed by children is dunking for apples. Apples are put in tubs full of water. People try to get the apples using only their mouths; they cannot use their hands."

Instead of sending the woman away, the holy man _ .	"There is an old Chinese tale about a woman whose only son died. Sadly, she went to the holy man and asked, ""What magical things do you have to bring my son back to life?"" Instead of sending her away or reasoning with her, he said to her, ""Fetch me a mustard seed from a home that has never known sadness. We will use it to drive the sadness out of your life."" The woman happily went off at once in search of that magical mustard seed. She first came to a splendid house, knocked at the door and said, ""I am looking for a home that has never known sadness. Is it such a place? It is very important to me."" They told her ""You've certainly come to the wrong place"" and began to describe all the tragic things that had happened to them recently. The woman said to herself, ""I have had misfortune of my own. Who is able to help these poor, unfortunate people?"" She stayed to comfort them, and then went on in search of a home that had never known sadness. But wherever she went, she found one tale after another of sadness and misfortune. She became so involved in other people's sorrow that finally she forgot about her search for the magical mustard seed, never realizing that it had, in fact, driven the sadness out of her life."

Which is the best title for the passage?	"Treatment for HIV has become more widespread, especially in poorer countries. It's also become cheaper, as medicine companies have lowered their prices for life-saving anti-retroviral drugs . But these drugs are still expensive and many countries are looking to create the biggest impact with limited resources. That's where World Health Organization guidelines come in, says Rochelle Walensky, a disease researcher from Harvard. Walensky and her colleagues used computer programs to model the most cost-effective disease interventions , as well as collected data from clinics in Africa and India about what works best. They found that among the choices of what to do first, earlier anti-retroviral therapy improved five-year survival dramatically and resulted in the longer life expectancy. But cost-effective doesn't always mean affordable, especially for governments in poor countries. Countries still have to make difficult choices about how much treatment they can afford. People in Nairobi, Kenya on Thursday, Dec. 9, 2010, protest a potential free trade area agreement between the EU and India that could see cheap anti-AIDS drugs phased out . However, Walensky notes that first-line anti-retrovirals--those medicine given to newly diagnosed patients that can keep away from symptoms for years - are much cheaper than they were a decade ago. ""Second-line therapy have come down quite a bit but not to the level of first-line and countries are having a hard time affording them and increasingly over time, people are going to fail first-line therapy and they're going second-line therapy and then, eventually, they're going to need third-line therapy, some of them."" According to Walensky, history has shown that drug prices can come down when international pressure is applied to drug makers. But for now, she says, countries should focus on treating as many people as they can, as early as possible Her paper is published in the online journal PLoS Medicine."

Pinto will most likely agree that _ .	"Is it ever a good idea admitting a teenager to carry a credit card? My kids watch closely as I swipe the card through the register. They've seen me do it hundreds, thousands of times. Cool. They are _ to swipe it through the machine themselves. When we walk out of the store with our groceries or pet food, or whatever, it's almost as though money has not changed hands, painless, easy. So it shouldn't be shocking to discover that teenagers are becoming card carrying consumers in their own right. The question is, should they? While some argue it's best to teach kids how to use a credit card while still living under the family roof, not everyone agrees. Dave Ramsey, financial expert says getting credit card for your teenager is actually ""an excellent way to teach him or her to be financially irresponsible."" Now parents are required to co-sign on credit cards for children under 21. ""If their name is on the credit card, then the parent may say, Hey, my name is on this. Don't get me into trouble,"" says Mary Beth Pinto, a marketing professor. ""When parents were the co-obligors , the children caused less debt. If the parents are the co-obligors, the tendency is that the parents were explaining how to use the cards."" Still, Pinto believes parents should start the process much earlier. ""Yes, there has to be teaching going on and it has to start when they're younger. You're not going to get rid of credit cards. They are here to stay. You have to have them. You can't fight progress,"" Pinto said. Ramsey, however, disagrees. ""Throwing teens into a pool of (credit) sharks is a sure way to guarantee a life-time of heartache."" he said, ""You can make online purchases and rent a car with a credit card. Of course, you must have money in your bank account before you can make a purchase with a credit card. But paying for things with money is what you are supposed to do."""

The writer wanted to tell the readers _ .	"People say teenagers are no good. They make too much noise in shopping malls; they drive carelessly up and down America's main streets. And at least some of the time those things are true. But we shouldn't forget that there are hard moments in the life of a teenager too. I watched such a moment not long ago at a woman's funeral which happened in a church. A teenage grandson stepped forward. Softly he began:""I want to share a few values that Nana taught me. She never failed to see light in any situation. When our family dog would attack her, what would Nana say? Oh, what beautiful markings that dog has."" That was Nana. ""She was a strong woman who often lived in the shadow of my grandpa, who was a successful businessman in this city. But she was the one behind the scenes who provided the strength and support for Grandpa's career,"" he said, with a voice now trembling. ""That was Nana's way."" Finally, in a voice breaking free of sorrow, he looked up and said, ""Nana taught me courage. She put up a fight to the end, when she died peacefully, which is how she lived her life. That was Nana's way, and I hope I can carry on in the same manner."" There are no hearts as sensitive as those of teenagers, because everything is happening to them for the first time. The trouble with teenagers is that they haven't learned to be controlled. When that boy rose to speak about the woman who had been his dearest friend, his honest voice dragged each of us out into the open where we could no longer hide. I was moved and learned a lot."

To parents who take the responsibility for children's expenses, the cost of living increases because _ .	In the past, American families tended to be quite large. Parents raising five or more children were common. Over the years, the size of the family has decreased. One reason for this is an increase in the cost of living. On the average, children attend schools for more years than they used to, making them financially dependent on their families longer. Moreover, children nowadays are better dressed and have more money to spend on entertainment. The parents usually take the responsibility for all the expenses. Meanwhile, families are less close than they used to be. More and more American mothers work away from home. The break up of the family occurs when the parents divorce. A lot of children in the U. S. live part of their young lives with only one parent. Broken families usually result in problems for children and parents alike. Children blame themselves when their parents separate. They grow up feeling unsettled as they are moved back and forth between parents. Usually one parent is responsible for raising the children. These single parents must care for the children's emotional and psychological needs while also supporting them financially. This is very demanding and leaves very little time for the parent's own personal interests. Single parents often marry other single parents. In this type of family, unrelated children are forced to develop brother or sister relationship. The situations of many American families today are not good. However, recent signs indicate that things are getting better. The divorce rate is declining. The rate of childbirth is rising. Perhaps Americans have learned how important families are.

Recognizing these mirrors helps us _ .	"The other day I was really annoyed by a friend's behavior, and when I told my best friend Terry about it, he laughed and said, "" But Jenny, you do that all the time!"" Well, that surprised me and set me laughing as well. Terry was absolutely correct. The very thing I had been annoyed at my friend for was a reflection of my own behavior. Almost all of us have experienced something like this at some time. When we find ourselves upset or annoyed by situations or by the behaviors of others, it is usually because they are mirroring something in ourselves that we subconsciously know, and we are ready to look at _ and make a change. Understanding this is an important part of self-growth. When we become aware of the characteristics or behaviors we dislike in others, it may be because we are displaying those features in others in order for us to see and deal with them in ourselves. For example, if we need to learn to control our own habit of using sarcasm , then we will attract very sarcastic people to us. And we will continue to do so until our lesson in regard to sarcasm is learned. Recognizing these mirrors helps us do two very important things. It helps us to accept ourselves fully, not just the parts we are happy with. And secondly, it helps us to become more caring and able to love others just as they are. After all, they are only showing us what we do ourselves. Who knows? We could very well be mirrors for them, too."	['accept our bad parts']
The butcher did not give any meat to the dog _ .	"It was Monday.Mrs.Smith's dog was hungry,but there was not any meat in the house.

At noon,the dog came to the shop again.It gave the butcher a piece of paper again.After reading it,he gave it half a pound of meat once more. The next day,the dog came again exactly at noon.And as usual,it brought a piece of paper in the mouth.This time,the butcher did not take a look at paper,and gave the dog its meat,for he had regarded the dog as one of his customers . But,the dog came again at four o'clock.And the same thing happened once again.To the butcher's more surprise,it came for the third time at six o'clock,and brought with it a third piece of paper.The butcher felt a bit puzzled.He said to himself,""This is a small dog.Why does Mrs.Smith give it so much meat to eat today?""

The argument against the headmaster's request is that _ .	"Have you ever seen any students whose trousers hang so low that you can see their underwear? What do you think of that? Fashionable? Some of today's teenagers are big fans of such a look. But recently this trend has been at the center of an argument in Italian middle schools. The headmaster of a school in central Italy has asked students to stop wearing low-rise jeans that expose underwear and parts of the body. His request came after a class trip, when he saw one boy's baggy trousers slide to his feet. He pointed out that this way of dressing is not suitable for school. But in Italy, a nation that takes fashion very seriously, the suggestion caused a debate among parents, teachers and students. The issue is whether the headmaster's request will limit students' freedom-- or whether dress in Italian schools is too casual. A parents' group praised the move in favor of good taste, while others advised schools to stop worrying about fashion and fix up old school buildings. ""We do not want to kick fashion out,"" the headmaster explained, ""but extremes of fashion like this are not right in school."" Many other schools have now requested that their students also stop wearing such trousers. Most students have simply ignored the request. Ludovica Gaudio, 14, wore extremely low trousers exposing orange underwear in class. It was cold, so she wore a matching orange scarf. Another 14-year-old said she would probably respect the request, simply for practical reasons. ""I don't really feel comfortable in those sort of jeans,"" said Sarah Lattanzi, ""in winter, when dressed like that, it's quite cold and I am afraid my stomach will ache."""

Which of the following may Piers Steel support?	"As the new semester begins,millions of college students across the country are trying hard to remember how best to write a paper-or,more likely,how best to delay that paper. _ is the thief of time and a lot of students suffer from it.They can spend whole days in the library doing nothing but staring into space,eating snacks,surfing the Internet,watching videos and looking at their pretty peers sitting around them,who,most likely,are doing nothing either. Paralyzed by their habit to procrastinate,they write micro blogs about their fears,asking their online friends if they sometimes have the same issue.But this does nothing to solve their problems. According to a recent report by the BBC,95 percent of us procrastinate at some point and 20 percent of the world's population are procrastinators,complicating their lives with their continual delaying of tasks. Procrastinators like to find excuses to justify their behavior,but BBC columnist Rowan Pelling says they are all wrong.Many procrastinators tell themselves they are perfectionists who work best under pressure.Pelling says this is nonsense,as work done at the last minute is more likely to have mistakes than work done on time. She says the behavior of procrastinators often makes them feel flustered and ashamed,inconveniences others,and annoys loved ones. Fortunately,social seientists have made tireless efforts to understand this behavioral shortcoming and offer strategies to control it.Piers Steel,a Canadian social scientist and author of The Procrastination Equation,believes humankind is""designed""to procrastinate.Nevertheless,he suggests a couple of good ways to get through the task at hand. The first one is obvious:Break the task down into small pieces and work your way through them methodically. The second is clever:Give a trusted friend a sum of money and tell them that if you don't complete the task you have undertaken by a specific time,they can keep it or donate it to a cause you hate."

Last Saturday morning, Mr Jackson took his wife and two little sons to the aquarium. At the ticket office, he asked, ""How much shall I pay to get in?""

What did the cleaning lady look like?	"During my second year of nursing school, our teacher gave us a test. I was a hardworking student and I did well in all the subjects. I finished the questions successfully until I read the last one: ""What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?"" Of course this was a joke. I saw the cleaning woman every day. She is short and about 60 years old. She has dark hair. But how would I know her name? I had never talked with her before. In fact, I'd never even thought about talking to her. I stared at my paper and started to feel rather guilty. Finally, I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Before the class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our grades. ""Absolutely,"" the teacher said. ""In your life, you will meet many people. All are important. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is to smile and to say hello."" I've never forgotten that lesson. Everyone deserves my attention and I should get to know all of the people who work and live around me. That was, perhaps, the most important lesson of my life. I also learned the cleaning woman's name was Dorothy."	['She was not tall.']
The passage talks about _ .	An American friend has invited you to visit his family. You've never been to an American's home before, and you're not sure what to do. Should you take a gift? How should you dress? What time should you arrive? What should you do when you get there? Glad you asked. When you're the guest, you should just make yourself at home. That's what hospitality is all about: making people feel at home when they're not. The question of whether or not to bring a gift often makes guests squirm . Giving your host a gift is not just a social _ in some cultures-it's expected. But in American culture, a guest is not necessary to bring a present. Of course, some people do bring a small present to their host to show their thanks. The right gifts for the host might be flowers, candy, and you can bring toys if the family has small children. _	['what to do while visiting your friends']
What is the author's attitude towards the future of biometrics?	"""Iris scan , please,"" the bank's computer voice tells you . You step up and the computer reads your eye , comparing it to the stored file it has of your iris. The images had better match--otherwise you won't be able to get your money. Iris scanning and other technologies , such as fingerprint and voice scanning , have appeared in many science fiction movies in the past. Today , these advanced technologies are part of the real world. They are common at work, the bank, the airport, and your local prison. The iris scan, fingerprint scan, and voice scan are all examples of biometrics a fast developing area of automatic personal identification technology . Basically , biometrics uses various ways to verify a persons identity , based on the individual's unique characteristics ,including fingerprints , voices, irises, body heat patterns, facial images, handprints , signatures and so on. Biometrics identification systems have a number of advantages over password systems. The primary advantage is that an individual has to be physically present in order to be identified. Another important advantage is that there are no passwords to remember , forget, lose or steal. The voice scan is the simplest and most affordable form of biometrics . It only requires a computer, a microphone and the correct software. The software records a subject's voice and then compares it to a stored voice sample for identification purposes. For additional safety, fingerprint and handprint scans can also be employed . Fingerprint scans take the image of a fingerprint and compare it to a stored file of prints. Handprint scans identify the unique features of a hand. Iris scans currently give the highest level of accuracy among all the available biometrics systems. Another technology , full facial scans , is currently in use at border crossings and airports. Facial scanning equipment can actually track and identify moving faces within a crowd. The potential of biometrics is exciting and encouraging . With continued development , testing , and application , current technologies will become even more effective in the future. Soon , the days of password and car keys will be gone . Just don't leave home without your fingerprints!"	['He feels hopeful about it .']
What punishment waits for Buster Brown?	"Buster Brown was a thief and a good one too,he thought.

Confidently,he stood outside the house of his intended victim and read the sign on the front gate of the house.""Don't worry about the dog--be aware of the owner!"" it said.Buster smiled and found his way in. The house looked quite normal outside,but inside it was very exotic with fascinating objects on display.As he began putting them into his bag,a dog came into the room.It stopped when it saw Buster,then wagged its tail madly and went over to him,licking his outstretched hand.

""Well,boy,"" Buster whispered,finally.""That might do.Any more and I won't be able to carry it!"" He swung the heavy bag onto his shoulders, just as the lights came on, nearly blinding him. He shielded his eyes with his hand. ""You're a very silly person,"" the figure in the doorway said, his voice dry and dust. As the man came closer, Buster could see he was well dressed. His face seemed familiar, but Buster couldn't quite place where he had seen him before. ""You should have taken more notice of the sign outside,"" the man rasped.

Which of the following can be the best headline for the passage?	"A sixth of undergraduates in Beijing this year have registered at driving school. The students, mostly from majors such as business management or international trade, will finish their driving courses within 20 days or so. Training costs have dropped to 2, 600 yuan for students, according to the Haidian Driving School in Beijing.

Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Rare birds in the UK have been living far better than the more common birds over the last decade due to the efforts of conservation organisations, according to a new assessment. The research shows almost 60% of the 63 rare birds that live in the UK have increased over the last 10 years. By contrast, only about one third of common species have increased over the same period. Just 28% of rare birds have decreased over the same period, compared with four out of every 10 common birds. The rare birds described in the assessment with increasing populations include theosprey andcorncrake . All of these birds are subject to conservation action. The declining common birds include the nightingale,swift , house sparrow and redgrouse . These are suffering declines for a variety of reasons, including changes in farming practices. Dr David Noble, from the British Trust for Ornithology, said: ""That some of our rarer birds have responded to targeted conservation action is great news. It shows just what can be achieved. What we need to do now is to continue the good work and use some of the lessons we have learned to help our more common birds."" Dr Mark Avery, the conservation director of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), said: ""Over the last decade we've enjoyed some great conservation successes, including removing some threatened species from the World Conservation Union's Red List of Thratened Animals and increasing the populations of red kite, osprey, etc. However, these successes arecountered by continued declines of some widespread species.""

Jamie thought _ were healthy food.	"In the UK, most children have their lunches at school, but in some schools, parents can choose what their children eat. The children can have a school dinner-a hot, cooked meal; or they can take a packed lunch with them, which usually includes cold food like sandwiches. Often parents know what their children want. Cath, a mother of three children, told us, ""My children have packed lunches because they say they don't like to have school dinners. So I make three packed lunches every morning."" However, another mother, Susan, made a different choice. She said, ""My daughters have a always had school dinners. I think they probably get healthier food at school than a few sandwiches I make for them."" But how healthy are school dinners? Kaz, a father, thought poorly of them. He said, ""Fizzy drinks were offered and I think there were a lot of chips."" Jamie Oliver spent a year working in a school kitchen. He was worried about the unhealthy food which included burgers, pizzas and chips. So he tried to cook healthy food such as good stews and curries for the children instead. So Jamie improved the school dinners, and trained the dinner ladies to cook healthy food in that school. Then he advised the government to improve school food across the country. And it seems that the changes have begun. Anna, a pupil, told us, ""We used to have a fast food window where you got chips and coke, but they stopped that this year. There's a salad restaurant, which is good, so it's healthier than it was."" ,."	['stews and curries']
Which of the person can we see in the film?	"What does the word""youth"" mean to you? Many define it as a precious time in their life when they are young ,when fun ,passion,and imagination seem limitless.But for most high school students,youth is a time of determination and willpower for achieving their goals. This is vividly shown in Mark of Youth,a movie that opened on Feb 5.Mark of Uouth tells the story of four Senior 3 students in a top high school in the days leading up to the national cooege entrance examination. Each character represents a differet type of student,ranging from the most mischievous to the most motvated .Like most teenagers ,they enjoy carefree moments and like to talk about their schoolmates.But the rension of the approaching exam,probably their first life-changing event,is common-they must memorize seemingly endless English words and Chinese poems,work through piles of aractice test papers,and improve their scores despite the increasing pressure. But life exists beyond campus.That the college entrance examination is coming up doesn't mean they can escape family changes,such as when one character's parents get divorced or another's father is arrested.Can these four young people handle their problems and eventually make it to their ideal universities despite their on -and -off campus stress? The story is set in Hubei Huanggang Middle School,known for its students'outstanding performances on the big exam.The four students are played by the actors who played in the reality shows Happy Boys and Happy Girls.HongKong actor Alex Fong plays their teacher.

Where does the passage probably come from?	"The question this week comes from our listener Herve Acard, who asks about the American word ""OK"", which means ""all right"" or ""acceptable"". It expresses agreement or approval. The word is used more often than any other word in the world. Language expert Allen Walker Read said the word began as a short way of writing a different spelling of the words ""all correct"". Old stories say some foreign-born people would write ""all correct"" as o-l-l k-o-r-r-e-c-t and spoke it as ""OK"". Some people say it came from the Native American Indian tribe known as the Choctaws. The Choctaw word ""okeh"" means the same as the American word ""OK"". Experts say early explorers in the Western America spoke the Choctaw language in the nineteenth century. The language spread across the country. According to some people, ""OK"" was a way to shorten Greek words that mean everything is fine. It is also said that a railroad worker named Obadiah Kelly invented the word. He is said to have put the first letters of his names -- O and K -- on each object people gave him to place on the train. Another explanation is that ""OK"" was invented by a political organization that supported Martin Van Buren for president in the 1800s. They called their organization the OK Club. The letters O and K were taken from the name of the town where Martin Van Buren was born -- Old Kinderhook, New York. Not everyone agrees with these explanations, but experts do agree that the word is purely American and has spread to almost every country on Earth. Yet in the United States, it is used mostly in speech. Serious writers prefer using words, such as ""agree"", ""approve"" or ""confirm"" instead."	['A radio program.']
Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?	"Loren Gladstone of Toronto is 58, but thinking over how to bequeath his digital property . Doing the paperwork after his parents' death was a challenge. ""When my time comes, I wonder if my children will even know what paper is,"" he says. As a software developer, his virtual property is both valuable and vital to his business. That reflects a problem. Online lives have increasing economic and emotional value. But testamentary laws offer confusing and incomplete ways of bequeathing and inheriting them. Digital property may include software, websites, downloaded content, online gaming identities, social-media accounts and even e-mails. In Britain alone holdings of digital music may be worth over PS9 billion ($14 billion). A fifth of respondents to a Chinese local-newspaper survey said they had over 5,000 yuan($790) of digital property. And value does not lie only in money.""Anyone with kids under 14 years old probably has two prints of them and the rest are in online galleries,""says Nathan Lustig of Entrustet, a company that helps people manage digital property. Service providers have different rules--and few state them clearly in their terms and conditions. Many give users a personal right to use an account, but nobody else, even after death. Facebook allows relatives to close an account or turn it into a memorial page. Gmail (run by Google) will provide copies of e-mails to an executor . Music downloaded via iTunes is held under a license which can be abolished on death. Apple declined to comment on the record on this or other policies. All e-mail and data on its iCloud service are deleted on the death of the owner. This has led to cases to court in America. In 2004 the family of Justin Ellsworth, an army man killed in Iraq, took Yahoo! to court in Michigan to get copies of his e-mails. This year, a court in Oregon ruled that another American mother whose son had died could use her dead son's password to enter his Facebook account for a short period. Now five American states have made laws giving executors control over the social-networking accounts of dead users. But this raises the subject of privacy. Passing music on is one thing; not everyone may want their relatives to read their e-mails. Colin Pearson, a London-based lawyer, says access should come only with a clear provision in a will. But laws, wills and password safes may be contrary to the providers' terms of service, especially when the executor is in one country and the data in another. Headaches for the living and lots of lovely work for lawyers."	['Lawyers can make money through cases about digital property.']

People in Shanghai can drink their tap water _ .	"People in Shanghai can quench their thirst with high quality water if the Shanghai Water Authority (SWA) is able to make good on its word. It has vowed to make the city's water match its status as a world class city. ""The current tap water quality meets national standards, but, compared with that of the European Union and the United States, it still needs to be improved."" said the SWA's director general, Hang Jiayi. In other developed countries, water fountains can be found almost everywhere--people do not bother with bottled drinking water. By 2020, the water of the Huangpu River will be treated to reduce the amount of organic waste in it. Major water works that draw water from the Huangpu will need more treatment facilities to improve the colour, texture, ammonia and nitrogen content before 2010. These treatment facilities are expected to cost 4 billion yuan, something that could affect the price of water, according to Chen Yin, SWA's deputy director general. Chen said that replacing water pipes was also a key project. The city's aged pipes are mostly to blame for the bad water quality. The SWA has started the water facilities renovation work, including the more than 14,000 kilometres of indoor piping, 107,000 tanks on top of the buildings, and more than 6,000 underground facilities. World Water Day came on March 22, and this year's theme is ""Water for the future"". Beijing is also drawing up plans during China's Water Week, which runs until March 28. By 2010, the water for the Shanghai EXPO is to be above World Health Organization standards. And, the people of Beijing will be able to drink their tap water as well."	['by 2010']
