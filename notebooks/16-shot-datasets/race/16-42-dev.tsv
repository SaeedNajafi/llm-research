"Question: For the author, being considered Hispanic represents _ . Context: This place was darker than I expected, and, in spite of the rain, dirtier. Used to the life of rural Puerto Rico , I had to adjust to the similarly arranged, aggressive two-dimensionality of New York. Everywhere I looked, my eyes met gray and brown straight-edged buildings with sharp corners and deep shadows. Every few blocks there was a cement playground surrounded by chain-link fence. A girl came out of the building next door, a jump rope in her hand, and she hopped over. ""Are you Hispanic?"" she asked. ""No, I'm Puerto Rican."" ""Same thing. Puerto Rican, Hispanic. That's what we are here."" She skipped a tight circle, stopped abruptly, and shoved the rope in my direction. ""Want a turn?"" ""Sure."" I hopped on one leg, then the other. ""So, if you're Puerto Rican, they call you Hispanic?"" ""Yeah. Anybody who speaks Spanish."" I jumped a circle, as she had done, but faster. ""You mean, if you speak Spanish, you're Hispanic?"" ""Well, yeah. No . . . I mean your parents have to be Puerto Rican or Cuban or something."" ""Okay, your parents are Cuban, let's say, and you're born here, but you don't speak Spanish. Are you Hispanic?"" ""I guess so,"" she finally said. ""It has to do with being from a Spanish country. I mean, you or your parents, like, even if you don't speak Spanish, you're Hispanic, you know?"" She looked at me uncertainly. But I didn't know. I'd always been Puerto Rican, and it hadn't occurred to me that in New York I'd be someone else. Later, I asked. ""Are we Hispanics, Mami?"" ""Yes, because we speak Spanish."" ""But a girl said you don't have to speak the language to be Hispanic."" ""What girl? Where did you meet a girl?"" ""Outside. She lives in the next building."" ""Who said you could go out to the sidewalk? This isn't Puerto Rico. Something could happen to you."" I listened to Mami's lecture with depressed eyes and the necessary respect. But inside, I quaked. Two days in New York, and I'd already become someone else. It wasn't hard to imagine that greater dangers lay ahead. </s>"	the loss of her former identity </s>

"Question: The main purpose of making lists is to _ . Context: Making lists is relaxing. It dictates the shape of the immediate future; it calms you down (it's OK, it's on a list somewhere) and it makes you feel good when you cross something off List-making is standard practice in therapy for depression). It might even help you to get things done too. The more you have to do, the more you need a list and few people with high-powered jobs get by without them. Women always think they're better at lists than men. Men tend to have tasks which they assemble 'into Action Plans whereas women just have lists of Things To Do. James Oliver, psychologist, has created his own ""time management matrix "". He writes a list of things to do and then organizes them into _ : things that have to be done straight away, other things that it would be good to do today, things that are important but haven't got to be done immediately and things that are less urgent but that he doesn't want to forget. ""Using categories to order the world is the way the human mind works,"" he says. ""After that, you should divide things into levels of importance."" But he also warns, ""If people get too absorbed in making lists, it doesn't work. They have too many categories and lose their ability to decide which is the most important."" It's all a question of what works best for you, whether it's a tidy notebook, a packet of Post-it notes or the back of your hand. Having tried all these, student Kate Rollins relies on a computerized list, which is printed out each morning. ""My electronic organizer has changed my life,"" she says. ""Up to now, I've always relied on my good memory, but now that I'm working and studying, I find I've got too much to keep in my head."" So what are you waiting for? No, you're not too busy to make today the first day of your upgraded time-managed life. In fact, there's no better time than the present to begin to take increased control of your work and life. So, get out your pencil and pen and make a list. </s>"	organize one's work and life reasonably </s>
"Question: How do scientists know ""Motherhood may make women smarter""? Context: Motherhood may make women smarter and may help prevent dementia in old age by bathing the brain in protective hormones , U.S.researchers reported on Thursday. Tests on rats show that those who raise two or more litters of pups do considerably better in tests of memory and skills than rats who have no babies, and their brains show changes that suggest they may be protected against diseases such as Alzheimer's .University of Richmond psychology professor Craig Kinsley believes his findings will translate into humans.""Our research shows that the hormones of pregnancy are protecting the brain, including estrogen , which we know has many neuroprotective effects,"" Kinsley said. ""It's rat data but humans are mammals just like these animals are mammals,"" he added in a telephone interview.""They go through pregnancy and hormonal changes."" Kinsley said he hoped public health officials and researchers will look to see if having had children protects a woman from Alzheimer's and other forms of age-related brain decline. ""When people think about pregnancy, they think about what happens to babies and the mother from the neck down,"" said Kinsley, who presented his findings to the annual meeting of the Society of Neuroscience in Orlando, Florida. ""They do not realize that hormones are washing on the brain.If you look at female animals that have never gone through pregnancy, they act differently toward young.But if she goes through pregnancy, she will sacrifice her life for her infant--that is a great change in her behavior that showed in genetic alterations to the brain."" </s>"	They know it by experimenting on rats. </s>
"Question: The author described the Miller's behavior in order to _ . Context: Hans was an honest fellow with a funny round good-humored face. Living alone, every day he worked in his garden. In all the countryside there was no garden so lovely as his. All sorts of flowers grew there, blooming in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to see, and pleasant odors to smell. Hans had many friends, the most devoted being the Miller. So devoted was the rich Miller to Hans that he'd never go by his garden without plucking a large bunch of flowers or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with fruits. The Miller used to talk about noble ideas, and Hans nodded and smiled, feeling proud of having such a friend. The neighbors thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave Hans anything in return, though he had hundreds of sacks of flour, many cows and sheep, but Hans never troubled his head about these, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things about the unselfishness of true friendship. In spring, summer, and autumn Hans was very happy, but when winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to sell, he suffered from cold and hunger. Though extremely lonely, the Miller never came to see him then. ""There's no good in going to see Hans while the snow lasts."" The Miller said to his wife, ""When people are in trouble they shouldn't be bothered. So I'll wait till the spring comes when he's happy to give me flowers."" ""You're certainly very thoughtful,"" answered his wife, ""It's quite a treat to hear you talk about friendship."" ""Couldn't we ask Hans up here?"" said their son. ""I'll give him half my meal, and show him my white rabbits."" ""How silly you are!"" cried the Miller. ""I really don't know what's the use of sending you to school. If Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, our good supper, and our red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature. I am his best friend, and I'll always watch over him, and see that he's not led into any temptation. Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me for some flour. Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they shouldn't be confused. The words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things. Everybody can see that."" He looked seriously at his son, who felt so ashamed that he hung his head down, and grew quite scared, and began to cry into his tea. Spring coming, the Miller went down to see Hans. Again he talked about friendship. ""Hans, friendship never forgets. I'm afraid you don't understand the poetry of life. See, how lovely your roses are!"" Hans said he wanted to sell them in the market to buy back his things which were sold during the hard time of the winter. ""I'll give you many good things. I think being generous is the base of friendship."" said the Miller. ""And now, as I'll give you many good things, I'm sure you'd like to give me some flowers in return. Here's the basket, and fill it quite full."" Poor Hans was afraid to say anything. He ran and plucked all his pretty roses, and filled the Miller's basket, imagining the many good things promised by the Miller. The next day he heard the Miller calling: ""Hans, would you mind carrying this sack of flour for me to market?"" ""I'm sorry, but I am really very busy today."" ""Well,"" said the Miller, ""considering that I'm going to give you my things, it's rather unfriendly of you to refuse. Upon my word, you mustn't mind my speaking quite plainly to you."" Poor Hans was driven by his friendship theory to work hard for his best friend, leaving his garden dry and wasted. One evening Hans was sitting by fire when the Miller came. ""Hans,"" cried the Miller, ""My little boy has fallen off a ladder and hurt himself, and I'm going for the Doctor. But he lives so far away, and it's such a bad windy night. It has just occurred to me that you can go instead of me. You know I'm going to give you my good things, so you should do something for me in return."" ""Certainly,"" cried Hans. He struggled into the stormy night, and got the doctor to ride a horse to the Miller's house in time to save the boy. However, Hans got lost in the darkness, and wandered off into a deep pool, drowned. At Hans' funeral, the Miller said, ""I was his best friend. I should walk at the head of the procession."" Every now and then he wiped his eyes with a handkerchief. </s>"	warn the readers about the danger of a false friend </s>
"Question: What is the author's attitude towards the government? Context: Half a year ago I came across a book called""Salt,Sugar and Fat. How the Food Giants Hooked US"",but finished it only recently. I am far from being a fan of junk food,over-salty,or over-sweet stuff,and honestly this food doesn't appeal to me at all. Maybe it is related to the fact that I grew up in Russia and at that time we were not so exposed to the foreign, especially made in America foods. We knew Coca Cola,Pepsi,juice powder and Cheetos,but this stuff was not so cheap or available to buy it every day and we couldn't buy them in large quantities. We didn't know the word""fat""was not a bad thing but a normal of life for some people. We always had sweets and especially on holidays they were served as a dessert along with a cake. Russians like eating sweets when they drink tea. Even with my passion to desserts I still can'trelate myself to the people Michale Moss was writing about, those consumers who could not say""no"" when it came to junk food. What I found interesting in the book was that the author didn't focus on diets, necessity to exercise,sleep well at night and all other things we all are pretty aware of. The aim was not to teach people how to live but instead,after having made a huge research,interviewed more than 100 people in the food industry,Moss reveals the ugly of the food business. It puts all the facts in front of us and offers a choice:to buy or not to buy. However,the answer was known at the very beginning. Moss mentions the well-known food like Coca,Cola,Pepsi,Nestle and some others and tells how skillfully the consumers can be cheated when it comes to choosing what to put in the food basket in the supermarket. We like this taste of a chocolate,the crispy chips,and sweet porridges because it was all put on test by groups of scientists who made experiments to reveal what kind of taste will be most appealing to us. It involves brain,of course. Apart from scientific researches, it was also due to successful marketing strategies and plans that people prefer to buy food. In this companies'money race,the most vulnerable victims are kids. They can't tell good from bad and love everything that makes them feel good. Commercial ads of fast food particularly targeted kids and played on the fact that mothers can't fully control what their children eat because they spent all day at work. Mothers themselves buy chocolates bars and com flakes for their kids,guided by a powerful brainwashing that actually,these products were not unhealthy, on the contrary, it was encouraged to give them to kids, because fat and sugar provide energy, so they are good,right? Giving a credit to some food companies, they made attempts to fight the trend, but consumers,who already worked a habit of eating too salty, too fatting and too sweet products,didn't react to the changes. So the companies returned to the old policy. Surprisingly,such behavior was strongly backed up by the govermment. I would definitely recommend reading this book not only to those who struggle in the battle with his addiction to fast food but also people living healthily. It casts light on many things,including how vulnerable we can be in front of corporations and their powerful and accurate marketing strategies. </s>"	negative </s>

"Question: What would be the best title for this passage? Context: Babies are born yogis. Once we were all able to pull our toes up by our ears and laugh about it. Then we aged, got injured, and began carrying stress in our shoulders and back. In short, we lost our balance. Yoga is an ancient practice that helps create a sense of union in body, mind, and spirit. It brings us balance. I was seriously out of balance when I started practicing yoga in 1999. I had plantar facilities in both feet, and my doctor had warned me against all the things I loved to do: walking, hiking, and playing tennis. I was desperate for exercise. Yoga became my salvation and even enhanced my other fitness activities. I practice yoga at least twice a week, but I consider yoga to be part of my daily life because after a while you no longer just practice yoga--you love it. Yoga becomes part of your physical life. Your body grows stronger, more toned, and more flexible as you move from one pose to the other. I spent a week in Mexico at a yoga retreat, and it was the first vacation on which I lost weight. ""Rather than building muscle, yoga builds muscle tone,"" says Shakta Kaur Khalsa, author of the K.I.S.S. Guide to Yoga. ""Because yoga helps maintain a balanced metabolism , it also helps to regulate weight. Additionally, yoga stretches muscles lengthwise, causing fat to be removed around the cells."" I do yoga poses throughout the day. After hours at my computer, I stretch my stiff shoulders and arms. When I need a boost of energy, I do energizing poses. When I am feeling exhausted at the end of the day, I do restorative poses. Yoga becomes part of your mental life. Yoga teaches you to focus on breathing while you hold the poses. This attention to breath is calming; it dissolves stress and anxiety. I use yogic breathing on the tennis courts, in the dentist's chair, and in traffic jams. You should always leave a yoga practice feeling energized, not tired. If you feel tired after yoga, it means you spent the time ""fighting"" yourself, trying to force yourself into poses. In yoga, you ""surrender"" to the pose by letting go of the tension. Yoga becomes part of your spiritual life. Yoga is practiced by people from all religions; it is not restricted to any religious group. Yoga teaches ""right"" living in how we deal with ourselves and others. As I work on a difficult pose, I learn patience, forgiveness, and the value of gentleness. Yoga advocates proper eating, but you don't have to be a vegetarian to practice yoga. </s>"	The Benefits of Yoga </s>

"Question: ""Marine cloud whitening"" has an effect on global warming by _ . Context: Special ships that create clouds by sending seawater into the air could be the cheapest way of dealing with climate change, new research has found. The technique, known as ""marine cloud whitening"", would create clouds above the Pacific Ocean that would have a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight away from Earth. Nearly 2,000 wind-powered ships would cross the sea, getting seawater and sending it up through tall tubes. "" When you send saltwater into the air, you create bigger and whiter clouds, and thus reflect more sunlight back into space,"" said David Young from the group of the study. The paper by Professor Eric Bickel and Lee Lane looked into the costs of the projects. It found that cloud whitening would reduce the effects of climate change this century for no more than PS5.3 billion. This is only a small part of the PS150 billion that leading nations are considering spending to cut CO2 emissions each year. It is also more than 25 times cheaper than the PS140 billion cost of another project which would copy the cooling effect of volcanoes. The authors also compared the cost benefits that reducing temperatures would have. They found every PS1 spend on other ways would have PS15 of benefits, however every PS1 spent on cloud whitening would bring PS2,000 of benefits. These would include the human costs on health and the influence on other fields. David Young said, ""Marine cloud whitening could achieve as much for the planet as CO2cuts would, but with much less cost."" But he warned that these techniques shouldn't be considered as a long-period way to deal with climate change. "" It's important to note that this technique wouldn't reduce CO2emissions or deal with the causes of global warming, but would cover its effects."" he said. </s>"	cutting sunlight </s>

What could be bought ten years ago for one dollar now costs well over two dollars. It seems that this rate of inflation is tending to rise rather than to fall.If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices,one might think that inflation does not matter.But it does when money is losing value,it lacks one of the qualities of a good money---stability of value.It is no longer acceptable as a store of value;and it becomes an unsuitable standard of deferred payments.Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession,so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible.

"Question: By saying ""The happy childhood is hardly worth your while"", the writer really means that_. Context: ""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood. The happy childhood is hardly worth your while. ""Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood. And worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" That was Frank McCourt reading the opening lines of his book Angela's Ashes, released in nineteen ninety-six. This Irish American author best known for the Pulitzer Prize-winning autobiography Angela's Ashes that recorded his poor upbringing, died of cancer on Sunday, The New York Times reported. He was 78. Born in New York City, he was the eldest of seven children born to Irish immigrant parents. Angela's Ashes was a memoir that captured an irresponsible, drunkard father with a gift for story-telling. When not drunk, his father was absent, turning his back on a family so poor, McCourt wrote, that they were reduced to burning the furniture in their rented hut to keep warm. His mother struggled to raise her many children after his father left the family. Already struggling when the Great Depression hit, the family moved back to Limerick, where they slipped ever deeper into poverty in the 1930s. Three of McCourt's siblings died of diseases worsened by hunger and the wretchedness of their surroundings. McCourt himself almost died of typhoid fever as a child. In Angela's Ashes, he wrote of hunger, a home flooded with rainwater and the unbearable humiliation of seeking handouts from charities in the Irish city. But he told the story in a way that is expressive, warm and light-hearted. Frank McCourt left Ireland at the age of nineteen to return to New York City where he was born. He earned a degree in- English education and taught creative writing for nearly thirty years. After retiring in nineteen eighty-seven, he decided to write about his childhood. ""Angela's Ashes"" became a huge success and brought McCourt a 1997 Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award and other honors. Millions of copies of the book were sold worldwide and it was adapted into a 1999 movie starring Emily Watson and Robert Carlyle. </s>"	smooth childhood surely will not draw readers' attention </s>
