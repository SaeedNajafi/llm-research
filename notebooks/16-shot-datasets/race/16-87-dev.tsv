Question: Tea and coffee were first introducd to Europe in _ . Context: When tea and coffee were first introduced to Europe in the 18th century, people had different ideas about their use.Some said that tea and coffee were harmful to humans and they could cause people to die. In Sweden , King Gustaf III decided to find out whether or not this was true.It happened that there were two brothers in prison at that time.They were twins and were almost alike in every way.They had both been sentenced to death .The King decided to let them live if one of the men agreed to drink several cups of tea each day and the other several cups of coffee. Both brothers lived many years without problems of any kind.At last,the brother who had drunk tea every day died at the age of 83,the other died a few years later. Because of the experiment , tea and coffee got accepted and became popular as drink in Sweden, and it is one of the many countries of the world where much tea and coffee is drunk today. </s>	the eighteenth century </s>
"Question: Lin's success in N.B.A has _ . Context: HANGZHOU, China -- Millions of Chinese basketball fans who were upset about the retirement of Yao Ming, are excited to see another even more shining star, Jeremy Lin, rising from the N.B.A and becoming a household name all across China. ""We are amazed by Lin Shuhao's magic performance and should cheer him on,"" one Internet user wrote. ""His sport shirts have sold out, even including the counterfeit ones,"" said Zheng Xiaojun, a 24-year-old clerk. Lin's amazing success over the last month has caught the imagination of the Chinese. He has been particularly popular here in northern Zhejiang province, from which his grandmother went to Taiwan in the late 1940s. Cai Qi, a well-known micro blogger, posted a message on micro blog over the weekend stating that Lin's hometown is Jiaxing, a city near Hangzhou where Lin's grandmother grew up. Cai Qi's nephew Yu Guohua, a 56-year-old factory worker, is Lin's closest still living in northern Zhejiang. He said in a telephone interview that Lin had come to play basketball with the Jiaxing High School team last May and had been surrounded by admirers. Yu said he did not have a chance to meet Lin in the crowd, but managed to speak with his family. ""His father was very supportive of Lin's playing basketball, but his grandmother was not, for fear he would be injured,"" Yu said. Lin may owe his height, 6 feet 3 inches, to his grandmother's family, Yu said. Chen Weiji, the father of Lin's grandmother, was well over 6 feet and all of Chen's children were tall as well, he said. The N.B.A. believes that 300 million people in China play basketball. The retirement last year of Yao Ming took its main Asian draw away from the N.B.A. But Lin's appearance has helped the league remain a hot topic of Chinese online chatter. </s>"	drawn Chinese people's attention back to the league </s>
Question: We can infer from the passage that the writer probably _ . Context: Why do I volunteer with Big brothers / Big sisters of America? I have many reasons. Perhaps the biggest reason is that people once volunteered to help me. Years ago, I was on the other side of the table. I was lonely and I felt lost. It's a little embarrassing to talk about it now, but whatever the right direction in life was, I was going the opposite way. More than once, I found myself on the wrong path. If someone hadn't stepped in when he did, I probably wouldn't even be here now. I'd rather be in a prison or somewhere a lot smaller and deeper. I've seen the work that big brothers / sisters have been doing all over the country and I'm pleased to be part of it. I've never done anything that made me prouder than my volunteer work. Big brothers and sisters helped me get over sadness and depression as soon as possible. Then, if I can help anyone like they helped me, I am willing to serve for as long as they will have me serve them. There are no words to describe the joy I get from helping somebody turn their life around. Every time I think that that's me now, I'm proud and happy. Volunteering is how I want to leave my mark on the world. I recommend volunteering work to everybody, especially to somebody who isn't sure where they are going in life. Helping someone find their path is often the best way to find yours. Be a volunteer, and you will find your purpose in life. </s>	didn't know his purpose in life </s>
"Question: Which is the best title for the text? Context: They survive in some of the coldest environments in the world--but even penguins appreciate a warm woolly jumper once in a while. The mini knitted garments have helped save hundreds of flightless birds caught in oil spills, providing protection from the elements and stopping them from eating poisonous pollution. Knits tor Nature,a program run by The Penguin Foundation,which protects the little penguin population of Phillip Island,140km south-east of Melbourne,has created up to 300 different designs over the years--and it's all thanks to talented volunteers. ""There's a lot of hidden creativity out there,""said Lyn Blom,of the Phillip Island Nature Park.""People love to know that they're helping the penguins because they're so cute and small and they waddle up the beach and they're so strong and determined.But they need to be,they 1ive in a pretty tough sort of environment.'' A thumbnail--sized patch of oil can kill a little penguin,the smallest of the species,measuring just l3 inches and weighing l kg.The oil separates and mats their feathers,breaking natural waterproofing and heating functions. Ms Blom estimates she has knitted between 200 and 300 penguin jumpers over the years. A staff member read an article in an English women's magazine about knitting for guillemot birds and decided to adapt the designs. ""There's a lot of ladies out there who used to knit for their children and grandchildren.These ladies have spare wool and idle hands,and they love to feel loved and needed and we love and need them,""said Ms Blom. The Pengu in Foundation recently staged a competition for the most creative jumper,which received an enthusiastic response. The Penguin Foundation rescues approximately 20 birds a year.They even have a stockpile of jumpers in case of emergency-such as the large oil spill Phillip Island in 2001. In that instance,453 little penguins were affected,96 percent of which were saved-most thanks to the jumpers. </s>"	The penguins' new garments </s>
"Question: It could be inferred from the text that Bridgestone and Verizon _ . Context: When I was growing up in the suburbs of New York, our first local Earth Day was organized around a drive to a town field where families were urged to empty items from their basements for recycling rather than dropping them in the dustbin. It was an eye opening idea for a kid in 1970. But as an environmental reporter, I'm bored of the large amount of deals and promotions that arrive by email or in my office or home mailbox on Earth Day. Like Valentine's Day, Earth Day has become a huge marketing opportunity--a way to promote consumption. In fact, Earth Day is such a good sales opportunity that some shops, like Target, have expanded Earth Day into Earth Month. There isn't time to give you a variety of the Earth Day shopping opportunities I was informed of this past week. They included deals on buying bottled water and earth-friendly wipes. My award for the silliest promotion: a plan to gift 25 of the most environmentally conscious stars with unique, useful and ""green"" products and services, including skin care products, cheese-cake and artwork. My guess is most of the stuff will end up in celebrities' garbage. Is buying and selling a good way to celebrate and protect the environment? I would argue that Earth Day might be an occasion to consider giving up purchases or habits that are environmentally questionable or that we could happily do without. How about not buying bottled water, but refilling a water bottle? How about not buying foods--even ""organic"" foods--that are packed in non-recyclable plastic? Don't get me wrong. The company of Bridgestone is celebrating Earth Day by promising to repurpose a spent tire for every tire that it sells. Verizon will plant a tree for each cell phone you trade in. Some coffee stores will even refill reusable cups at no charge. Target is giving out free reusable carrier bags without requiring a purchase. But few shopkeepers are taking the next step-charging a fee at the cash register for disposable plastic bags, a common practice in Europe-to encourage customers to use those new reusable carriers.

"Question: What do the publishers mentioned in the passage have in common? Context: Besides news reports that tend to focus on war or election, Americans generally don't hear much about people in other countries. One reason may be that very little foreign-language literature is translated into English. In the United States, just a few of the titles, mainly translations of foreign novels, short stories, or poetry, make it into English. However, a number of efforts have taken root to try to bring more global literature to US audiences. Ks5u The online magazine of international literature, Words Without Borders, was founded by Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. The nonprofit site, now in its fifth year, offers modern writing from places such as Argentina, China and Italy, often for the first time in English. It gets about 200,000 page views per month and counts roughly 8,000 subscribers , more than one-quarter of whom live in the US. ""There's a wave of interest right now,"" says Jill Schoolman, publisher of Archipelago Books, a small nonprofit press in Brooklyn, N.Y., opened in 2003 to publish world literature in translation only. ""People are hungry for ideas from other countries."" Rainmaker Translations, a Las Vegas-based nonprofit, was formed two years ago to support the publication of more top-quality global writing here in the US. They put out their first three titles, translated from Arabic, Chinese and Russian, in the spring of 2006 and plan to aid up to four more in the coming year. In March, the Center for the Art of Translation, a nonprofit started in 1994 in San Francisco, will publish Two Lines World Library, focused on writing from some particular areas published over the last several decades. Dalkey Archive Press, a century-old nonprofit publisher in Champaign, Illinois, has upped the number of translations on its publication list since 2003, from 25 percent to nearly 80 percent. In recent years, more nonprofits have applied to the National Endowment for the Arts for help to publish literary translations. The agency is also trying to increase the availability of translated prose and poetry in the US, such as publishing partnerships with foreign governments. </s>"	They don't aim at making money by publishing global writing. </s>

"Question: What's the benefit of being involved in Postcrossing according to Emma Delaney ? Context: At any given time, hundreds of postcards are in transit across the world as strangers communicate through a movement called Post-crossing. Emma Delaney says it's a sad day when there isn't a postcard in her mailbox. She doesn't have a bunch of friends travelling overseas at the moment ---- she's just really active in the underground hobby of Postcrossing. ""I've sent over 3,000 postcards, but I've been doing it for close to seven years,"" she says. ""My husband, generally appreciative of my hobby, is sometimes frustrated by the amount of cardboard hanging around the house or in my car."" Postcrossing is a hobby where strangers send each other postcards across the world. You register on the website, list your interests and preferences for postcards, then receive an address of a stranger on the other side of the world to send a postcard to. ""I tend to send a lot of postcards of the local area because people are interested in where you're from and what you do,"" Emma says. From Uzbekistan to Belarus and Kazakhstan to Moldova, Emma has a growing collection of photos from around the world. The postcards have helped shape her international travelling too. ""I didn't travel overseas until I was 32 and a lot of the locations we chose for our honeymoon were selected because of the postcards I'd received."" ""Some people see sending mail as being a bit boring and unfashionable, but Postcrossing is popular and lots of people are fascinated that I do it.,"" The Postcrossing project has just celebrated its eighth birthday and has over 400,000 active members in 215 countries. The group says they've delivered over 18 million postcards. And while postal workers aren't supposed to read people's postcards, Emma says she's happy for them to do so at her post office in Shellharbour. She even encourages her correspondents to say hello to the Australia Post staff. ""It's a hobby that I continue to do because I find it enjoyable and relaxing."" </s>"	Broadening the mind. </s>
Question: Money was not used until _ . Context: In the earliest stages of man's development he had no more need of money than animals have. He was content with very simple forms of shelter, made his own rough tools and weapons and could provide food and clothing for himself and his family from natural materials around him. As he became more civilized, however, he began to want better shelter, more efficient tools and weapons, and more comfortable and more lasting clothing than could be provided by his own neighborhood or by the work of his own unskilled hands. For these things he had to turn to the skilled people such as smiths, leather workers or carpenters. It was then that the question of payment arose. At first he got what he wanted by a simple process of exchange. The smith who had not the time to look after land or cattle was glad to take meat or grain from the farmer in exchange for an axe or a plough . But as more and more goods which had no fixed exchange value came on the market, exchange became too complicated to be satisfactory. Another problem arose when those who made things wanted to get stocks of wood or leather, or iron, but had nothing to offer in exchange until their finished goods were ready. Thus the difficulties of exchange led by degree to the invention of money. In some countries easily handled things like seeds or shells were given a certain value and farmer, instead of paying the smith for a new axe by giving him some meat or grain, gave him so many shells. If the smith had any shells left when he had bought his food, he could get stocks of the raw materials of his trade. In some countries quite large things such as cows or camels or even big flat stones were used for trade. Later, pieces of metal, bearing values according to the rarity of the metal and the size of the pieces, or coins were used. Money as we know it had arrived. </s>	the exchange of one thing for another became too complicated </s>

Question: The Republic of Sudan was probably founded in _ . Context: Sudan is a rather large nation in the northeastern part of Africa. It has about twenty million people. It also has a short coastline along the Red Sea. Some northern areas of the country have deserts while the southern part has tropical rain forest. Their capital city is Khartoum. At Khartoum the Blue Nile and the White Nile come together to form the Nile River, which is the world's longest river. Khartoum has about four hundred and seventy thousand people. There are two groups of people who live in Sudan. In the northern part of the country, there are many Arabic-speaking Muslims. They make up about two-thirds of the total population. In the southern area, there are groups of people who speak African languages. The northern and southern areas also have different histories. People in the south lived by themselves for many years.

"Question: The passage mainly tells us _ . Context: When you're having a holiday, one of the main questions to ask is which hotel or apartment to choose. However, when it comes to France, you have another special choice: treehouses. In France, treehouses are offered to travelers as a new choice in many places. The price may be a little higher, but you do have a chance to _ your childhood memories. Alain Laurens, one of France's top treehouse designers, said, ""Most of the people might have the experience of building a den when they were young. And they like that feeling of freedom when they are children."" Its fairy-tale style gives travelers a special feeling. It seems as if they are living as a forest king and enjoying the fresh air in the morning. Another kind of treehouse is the ""star cube"". It gives travelers the chance of looking at the stars shining in the sky when they are going to sleep.

"Question: Why did the State Council submit the bill? Context: The State Council submitted a bill which aims to allow couples to have two children if either parent is an only child. It focuses on adjusting and improving the family planning policy. The State Council argues adjustment to the policy in the face of a steadily declining birth rate. The birth rate has remained relatively low and shows a tendency to fall further. The rate has dropped to between 1.5 and 1.6 since the 1990s, which means each Chinese woman of child-bearing age gives birth to 1.5 to 1.6 children on average. The working population began to drop in 2012 by 3.45 million every year, and it is likely to fall by 8 million each year after 2023. The population aged 60 and above will reach 400 million and account for one-fourth of the total population in the early 2030s, up from one-seventh now. ""If the current family planning policy continues, the birth rate will continue to fall and lead to a sharp drop of the total population after reaching a peak,"" said Li Bin, minister in charge of the National Health and Family Planning Commission. ""It is the right time to make changes: The low birth rate is stable, the working population is still large and the burden of supporting the elderly remains relatively light,"" he added. An increase in birth is expected if the policy changes but will not seriously affect the food supply, public education, health care or employment. China's food safety and public service plans are designed to meet the needs of 1.43 billion population in 2020 and 1.5 billion in 2033. Even with the policy change, the total population will reach no more than 1.38 billion in 2015, Li said. </s>"	To solve the social population issue. </s>
"Question: The sitting-rising test was first designed _ . Context: The simple exercise of sitting down and standing up again without holding onto anything, could suggest how long you have to live. This is the belief of a group of physicians, who came up with the 'sitting-rising test' to measure their patients' flexibility and strength. They developed a scoring system for the test and found that people who scored three points or less out of 10, were more than five times as likely to die within six years, as those who scored more than eight points. Claudio Gil Araujo, of Gama Filho University in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was among the doctors who originally developed the sitting rising test (SRT) to quickly assess the flexibility of athletes, but he now uses it to persuade his patients that they need to stay active to maintain their muscle and balance, and live longer, Discover Magazine reported. As we age, our muscles tend to become weaker and a loss of balance means we are increasingly likely to fall. Current ways to test frailty can be time-consuming, impractical and inaccurate for small doctors' surgeries, but experts are keen to keep older people moving. Dr Araujo says that anyone can take the SRT because no equipment is needed. In a study, published in the European Journal of Cardiology, the researchers described how 2002 adults aged between 51 and 80 took the SRT at Clinimex Exercise Medicine Clinic in Rio. They found that patients who scored fewer than eight points out of 10 on the test, were twice as likely to die within the next six years, compared with people with more perfect scores. One point was deducted each time a person used their hand or knee for support to either sit down or stand up, while half a point was deducted for losing their balance. The experts found that people who scored three points or fewer, were more than five times as likely to die within the same period. They wrote in the study: 'Musculoskeletal fitness, as assessed by SRT, was a significant predictor of _ in 51-80-year-old subjects.' The study found that every point increase in the test, was linked to a 21 per cent decrease in mortality from all causes. However, chartered physio-therapist Sammy Margo said that the exercise may be ""quite ambitious"" for older people in the UK. </s>"	to assess the flexibility of athletes. </s>
