Van der Lee and Ellemers' study shows that _ .	"Women are still underrepresented in top academic positions. One of the possible explanations for this is the increasing importance of obtaining research funding. Women are often less successful in this than men. Psychology researchers Dr. Romyvan der Lee and professor Naomi Ellemers investigated whether this difference also occurs at the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and examined potential explanations. The researchers were assigned by NWO to carry out this study as part of the broader evaluation of NWO's procedures and its gender diversity policy. The aim was to gain more insight into the causes of the differences in awarding rates for male and female applicants for research funding. The analysis addressed an important ""talent programme"" of NWO, the Veni grant. ""Whoever receives this grant has a greater chance of obtaining an important appointment at a university,""says Naomi Ellemers. Van der Lee and Ellemers investigated all the applications submitted by male and female researchers over a period of three years: a total of 2823 applications. Under the direction of NWO these applications were assessed by scientific committees consisting of men and women. The results demonstrate that the awarding rates for female applicants (14.9%) are systematically lower than those for male applicants (17.7%). ""If we compare the proportion of women among the applicants with the proportion of women among those awarded funding, we see a loss of 4%,"" said Ellemers. The study reveals that women are less positively evaluated for their qualities as researcher than men are. ""Interestingly the research proposals of women and men are evaluated equally positively. In other words, the reviewers see no difference in the quality of the proposals that men and women submit,"" says Romy van der Lee. In search for a possible cause for the differences in awarding rates and evaluations, the researchers also investigated the language use in the instructions and forms used to assess the quality of applications. This clearly revealed the occurrence of gendered language. The words that are used to indicate quality are frequently words that were established in previous research as referring mainly to the male gender stereotype (such as challenging and excellent). Romy van der Lee explains: ""As a result, it appears that men more easily satisfy the assessment criteria, because these better fit the characteristics stereotypically associated with men."" In response to the results of this research, NWO will devote more attention to the gender awareness of reviewers in its methods and procedures. It will also be investigated which changes to the assessment procedures and criteria can most strongly contribute to more equal chances for men and women to obtain research funding. This will include an examination of the language used by NWO. NWO chair Jos Engelens said, ""The research has yielded valuable results and insights. Based on the recommendations made by the researchers we will therefore focus in the coming period on the development of evidence-based measures to reduce the difference in awarding rates."""

If a man loses the ability to recognize his right side, _ .	"When you close your eyes and try to think of the shape of your own body, what you imagine (or rather, what you feel) is quite different from what you see when you open your eyes and look in the mirror. The image you feel is much vaguer than the one you see. And if you lie still, it is quite hard to imagine yourself as having any particular size or shape. When you move, when you feel the weight of your arms and legs and the natural resistance of the objects around you, the ""felt"" image of yourself starts to become clearer. It is almost as if it were created by your own actions and the feelings they cause. The image you create for yourself has rather strange proportions ; certain parts feel much larger than they look. If you get a hole in one of your teeth, it feels enormous; you are often surprised by how small it looks when you inspect it in the mirror. Although the ""felt"" image may not have the shape you see in the mirror, it is much more important. It is the image through which you recognize your physical existence in the world. In spite of its strange proportions, it is all one piece, and since it has a consistent right and left and a top and bottom, it allows you to locate new feelings when they occur. It allows you to find your nose in the dark and point to a pain. If the felt image is damaged for any reason--if it is cut in half or lost as it often is after certain strokes which wipe out recognition of one entire side -these tasks become almost impossible. What is more, it becomes hard to make sense of one's own visual appearance. If one half of the ""felt"" image is wiped out or injured, the patient stops recognizing the affected part of his body. It is hard for him to find the location of feelings on that side, and, although he feels the doctor's touch, he locates it as being on the undamaged side."	"[""he can't locate the doctor's touch on his right side""]"
How did the seed feel after hearing the traveler's words at last?	"A long time ago, there was a seed and because he was only a seed, nobody noticed him. Thus, feeling inferior , the seed gave no importance to his existence . Then one day, a wind picked him up and threw him on an open field in the sun. Later, he was given rain. Years later he saw a traveler sitting by his side. ""Thank you God for this. I really need some rest,"" he heard the traveler say. ""What are you talking about?"" the seed quickly asked. He thought the man was making fun of him. No one ever spoke to him like that. ""Who just spoke?"" the shocked man asked. ""It is me. A seed."" ""A seed?"" The man looked at the big tree. ""Are you joking? You are not a seed. You are a big tree!"" ""Really?"" ""Yes! Why else do you think people come here?"" ""What do they come here for?"" ""To feel your shade ! Don't tell me you didn't know you had grown over time."" A moment passed before the traveler's words brought him pride. The seed thought and smiled for the first time in his life. The years of torture by the sun and the rain finally helped him grow up. ""Oh! That means I'm not a little seed anymore! I was actually born to make people feel comfortable. Wow! That's great!"""	['Proud.']
Why are the English abbreviations becoming more and more popular according to the passage?	"Does technology pose a threat to the purity of Chinese language? Many Chinese use instant messenger tools such as MSN or QQ, listen to music on MP3 players and log on the Internet using ADSL--most without knowing the literal Chinese translation of the abbreviations . But they don't have to, as many English letters have become part of the local vocabulary. A dozen abbreviations including GDP, NBA, IT, MP3, QQ, DVD and CEO are among the 5,000 most-frequently used words in the Chinese media last year, according to a report on the 2006 Language Situation in China. The report said some parents are so keen on English letters that a couple tried to name their baby ""@"", claiming the character used in email addresses reflects their love for the child. While the ""@""is obviously familiar to Chinese e-mail users, they often use the English word ""at"" to pronounce it ""ai ta"",or ""love him"". The study collected more than 1 billion language samples from newspapers, magazines, TV, radio and websites. The annual report is jointly compiled by the Ministry of Education and the State Language Commission. ""Nowadays, more and more English abbreviations are being used in Chinese, making them an important part of modern language,"" said Hou Min, a professor at Communication University of China. ""The abbreviations have gained popularity because of the ease of usage,"" Hou said. For example, DNA is much simpler to use than its Chinese version. ""As more Chinese people learn foreign languages, especially English, in recent years, using abbreviations has become a trend among educated people,"" she added. Some language scholars fear such usage will contaminate the purity of Chinese and cause confusion in communication."	['Because English abbreviations are easy and simple to use.']
According to Ken Drew and Dr. Patel, people get slightly constipated and have heart pain because _ .	"Quickly ask yourself: What did you eat today? Now tell me how you actually feel. If you're complaining of stress, anxiety, depression, aches and pains, foggy thinking, or just a general lack of energy, a new medical theory will blow your mind. The chances are that those disease-like symptoms are all the result of what's called hidden food allergies . This is what Ken Drew found out when he was lucky enough to be recommended to medical practitioner Dr. Patel. Patel is considered something of a genius, and has been called a modern day Louis Pasteur. You've heard of him, of course--Pasteur figured out how to keep milk from getting spoiled. Dr. Patel is like a Louis Pasteur for keeping your body from getting spoiled from chronic diseases. ""Foggy thinking, slightly constipated , heart pain,...you name it. It's part of getting old,"" you say. ""It's just stress."" Most of the body's immune defenses are all located in your stomach, so when you have a hidden food allergy and you expose yourself to harmful foods, your defenses malfunction and disease-carrying bacteria take over. Had you not eaten that one food you were allergic to for breakfast, you would never have got sick. Together, Dr Patel and Ken Drew have developed the Reverse My Disease program, which claims it can _ your body against diseases like arthritis , Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease and cancers. You won't need a prescription and there isn't any kind of medical procedure involved. There's no medical jargon, no complicated diet to do. What it does do is claim to tell you how to hack your body's natural defense system. Dr. Patel has remained under the radar of the entire medical establishment because his ideas are so threatening to doctors who don't want you to stop being sick enough for them to write you prescriptions. Those doctor visits cost you, so check out Reverse My Disease if you want to prevent disease by learning how to eat food that won't harm your body."	"[""they don't eat the right food.""]"
Which of the following contributes to the emergence of musical prodigies according to the passage?	"Violin prodigies , I learned, have come in distinct waves from distinct regions. Most of the great performers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were born and brought up in Russia and Eastern Europe. I asked Isaac Stern, one of the world's greatest violinists the reason for this phenomenon. ""It is very clear,"" he told me. ""They were all Jews and Jews at the time were severely oppressed and ill-treated in that part of the world. They were not allowed into the professional fields, but they were allowed to achieve excellence on a concert stage."" As a result, every Jewish parent's dream was to have a child in the music school because it was a passport to the West. Another element in the emergence of prodigies, I found, is a society that values excellence in a certain field to nurture talent. Nowadays, the most nurturing societies seem to be in the Far East. ""In Japan, a most competitive society, with stronger discipline than ours,"" says Isaac Stern, children are ready to test their limits every day in many fields, including music. When Western music came to Japan after World War II, that music not only became part of their daily lives, but it became a discipline as well. The Koreans and Chinese as we know are just as highly motivated as the Japanese. That's a good thing, because even prodigies must work hard. Next to hard work, biological inheritance plays an important role in the making of a prodigy. J. S. Bach, for example, was the top of several generations of musicians, and four of his sons had significant careers in music."	['a natural gift.']
We can learn from the passage that Benjamin Franklin _ .	"Everyone knows the story of Benjamin Franklin's famous kite experiment. He was a man of many gifts and interests. His natural curiosity about things made him try to find ways to make them work better. Although he made important discoveries, Ben didn't ""invent"" electricity. He did, however, invent the lightning rod which protected buildings and ships from lightning damage. In America, most people warmed their homes by building a fire in a fireplace even though it was kind of dangerous and used a lot of wood. Ben said that he had another better way. His invented an iron stove which allowed people to warm their home less dangerously and with less wood. The stove that he invented is called a Franklin stove. Ben also set up the first fire company and the first fire insurance company in order to help people live more safely. As the postmaster, Ben had to find out the best way for delivering the mail. He went out riding in his carriage to measure the routes and needed a way to record the miles. He invented a simple _ for it. In his old age, Ben retired from business and public service and wanted to spend his time reading and studying. He found, however, that his old age had made it difficult for him to reach books from the high shelves. Even though he had many grandchildren to help him, he invented a tool called a long arm to reach the high books. The long arm was a long wooden pole with a grasping claw at the end. Later, other famous inventors, like Thomas A. Edison and Alexander Graham Bell, would follow in Ben's footsteps by trying to find ways to help people live better. Today's curious thinkers are keeping Ben's traditions alive by inventing new and improved ways to make things work."	['set up some companies to help people to live better']
Follow Your Heart is _ .	"As students, you may have many dreams. They can be very big like becoming Superman, or they can be small. You may just want to become one of the ten best students in your class. If you find a dream, what do you do with it? Do you ever try to make your dream come true? Follow Your Heart by Australian writer Andrew Matthews tells us that making our dreams come true is life's biggest _ . ""You may think you're not very good at some school subjects, or that it is impossible for you to become a star. These ideas stop you from getting your dream,"" the book says. In fact, everyone can make his dream come true. The first important thing you must do is to remember what your dream is. Don't let it leave your heart . Keep telling yourself what you want. Do this step by step and your dream will come true faster. A big dream is, in fact, many small dreams. Never give up your dream. There will be difficulties on the road.

Fresh bamboo shoots are easily found in _ .	Bamboo is a giant grass that grows in warm places. It has many uses. Everything--from chairs and fishing rods to basket and paper can be made from it. And that's not all. It can be eaten, too. People in China like bamboo shoots very much. They think the bamboo shoots are a delicious vegetable for parties and meals. In many parts of Asia, bamboo shoots are a favorite food. The winter shoots are the best because they are soft, with a white and green color. Usually they are boiled in water with some salt. Spring shoots are darker and harder, so they take longer to cook. But they are cheaper than winter shoots. Fresh bamboo shoots are seldom found outside bamboos' hometown. But people in other places can buy bamboo shoots, too. These shoots are kept in bottles and cans. They need no cooking and are almost as good as fresh bamboo shoots.	['Asia']

_ is grown in Yang Lin's hometown.	"Many young Chinese people drink coffee when meeting with friends. Yang Lin lives in the U.S. but comes from an area in China famous for growing tea. She used to only drink tea while in China. But now, she says, she drinks both and for different reasons. ""I would say ... I was a tea drinker when I was in China. But now, you know, with the influence of different holiday drinks ... I think I like coffee as well as tea now."" Yang Lin says that drinking coffee for her is a social event. She and her workmates like to sit in a cafe and talk over a cup of coffee. Tea, she says, is more about family memories. She grew up in Fujian Province -- an area known for its tea. Ms. Yang says that as a child, her family would get together in the evening and talk about the day's events over a pot of tea. So now, even the smell of Fujian tea brings back these warm family memories. Voyo is another Chinese woman who now lives in Washington D.C. She says that after moving to the U.S. her tastes changed. We would call her _ , someone who now chooses to drink coffee. ""I used to be a tea drinker before I came to the United States. But now I am a coffee drinker and actually getting to be a very heavy coffee drinker. Like I go from one cup a day to three cups a day and if I stop one day I will have a headache."" said Voyo."

Compared to the clear words of her boyfriend on screen, his accent becomes _ .	"After too long on the Net, even a phone call can be a shock. My boyfriend's Liverpudlian accent suddenly becomes too difficult to understand after his clear words on screen; a secretary's tone seems more rejecting than I'd imagined it would be. Time itself becomes fluid--hours become minutes, and alternately seconds stretch into days. Weekends, once a highlight of my week, are now just two ordinary days. For the last three years, since I stopped working as a producer for Charlie Rose, I have done much of my work as a tele-commuter. I submit articles and edit them by E-mail and communicate with colleagues on Internet mailing lists. My boyfriend lives in England; so much of our relationship is computer-mediated. If I desired, I could stay inside for weeks without wanting anything. I can order food, and manage my money, love and work. In fact, at times I have spent as long as three weeks alone at home, going out only to get mail and buy newspapers and groceries. I watched most of the blizzard of '96 on TV. But after a while, life itself begins to feel unreal. I start to feel as though I've merged with my machines, taking data in, spitting them back out, just another node on the Net. Others on line report the same symptoms. We start to strongly dislike the outside forms of socializing. It's like attending an A. A. meeting in a bar with everyone holding a half-sipped drink. We have become the Net opponents' worst nightmare. What first seemed like a luxury, crawling from bed to computer, not worrying about hair, and clothes and face, has become an avoidance ,a lack of discipline. And once you start replacing real human contact with cyber interaction, _ can be quite difficult. At times, I turn on the television and just leave it to chatter in the background, something that I'd never done previously. The voices of the programs relax me, but then I'm jarred by the commercials. I find myself sucked in by soap operas, or needing to keep up with the latest news and the weather. ""Dateline"", ""Frontline"" , ""Nightline,"" CNN, every possible angle of every story over and over and over, even when they are of no possible use to me. Work moves from foreground to background."

From the passage we can learn that _ .	Gateway Academy Pre-Sessional Courses Our pre-sessional courses are ideal for students who have a conditional place at a British university, but who need to achieve a certain level of English in order to be accepted. The course aims to provide students with the English language and study skills that they need in order to be successful at university or another academic establishment. It is important to note that completion of the course does not guarantee students' entrance into a university. It is necessary for students to show during the course that they have understood the information and skills that they have been taught, and can apply them to their work. Pre-sessional students at Gateway Academy will benefit from: * Small class sizes (no more than 10 students per class) * Twenty three hours of tuition per week * Individual support and tutorials * Regular guest lecturers * The use of the Academy's study and recreational facilities, including the Language Library, the computer suite, and the academy's sports facilities. * A varied social programme including evening entertainments and weekend excursions to popular tourist attractions and cities such as Stonehenge, Oxford and Stratford-on-Avon. The course offers an all-around approach to learning, and covers reading, writing, speaking and listening skills. During the course, students will receive instruction on important techniques such as summary-writing, analysing essay titles, organising writing, note-taking in lectures, giving seminars and making presentations. Students will gain experience in working both individually and in groups. As part of the course, all students will work towards a 5000-word project in their own field of study. Students will receive guidance from their tutors on how best to conduct research and write it up effectively. Students will also work towards a presentation on the same subject. There is no final examination. The attendance, successful completion of assignments and participation in class will be taken into account. Students will be given a full report on their progress at the end of the course. Students need to be aware that the course involves a great deal of coursework, which will require students to manage their time effectively.	['the course emphasizes the application of skills']
We can infer from the passage _ .	"My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening near my parents' tomb in the churchyard. ""Hold your noise!"" came a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the tombs at the side of the church. ""Keep still, you little devil , or I'll cut your throat!"" A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. He seized me by the chin . ""Tell us your name!"" said the man. ""Quick!"" ""Pip, sir."" ""Show us where you live,"" said the man. ""Point out the place!"" I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church. The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread. ""You young dog,"" said the man, licking his lips, ""what fat cheeks you ha' got. Darn me if I couldn't eat em, and if I han't half a mind to't!"" I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn't, and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying. ""Now then lookee here!"" said the man. ""Where's your mother?"" ""There, sir!"" said I. He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder. ""There, sir!"" I timidly explained, pointed to the tombstone. ""That's my mother."" ""Oh!"" said he, coming back. ""And is that your father alonger your mother?"" ""Yes, sir,"" said I; ""him too; late of this parish ."""	['the boy was very calm and smart']
What does the article mainly talk about?	"On the eve of our daughters' weddings, I gave both of them what I considered to be excellent marital advice: never leave your husband unsupervised with pruning shears . _ I recently let my guard down. Thirty-some years of marriage can do that to a woman. Give a man pruning shears and electric trimmers and he will give new meaning to ""armed and dangerous."" One day earlier this year, my husband said that the crab apple tree was dead. ""Why do you think it is dead?"" I asked. ""Look at it. There's not a leaf on it."" ""There's not a leaf on anything. It's March,"" I said. ""It looked sick last fall and with this bitter winter we had, I'm convinced it's dead."" The truth is he's never liked the crab apple. Sure, it has beautiful blooms in the spring, but then it gets a disease, the leaves curl, and it drops those little apples that sit on the driveway. Each passing week he pronounced the tree dead. Eventually I began to believe him. Though he agreed it would be a regrettable loss, there was a twinkle in his eye. He armed himself a couple of weeks ago and began trimming. A branch here, a branch there, a small limb, then a large limb. I watched and then decided to check the wood on some of the branches closer to the trunk. I broke one off and saw green. The crab apple was not dead. It just hadn't had time to leaf out. The tree was now falling to one side, but it was not dead. I would have told him so, but he had moved on to a maple. Once the man starts, he can't stop. One trim leads to another. ""Please, stop!"" I called. He smiled and nodded, but he couldn't hear because he had started the hedge trimmers and was getting ready to fix a line of hedges. Zip , zip, zip. ""What do you think?"" he shouted. ""It's supposed to be a privacy hedge; now all that will be private are our ankles."" He started the trimmers again. ""Stop!"" I called, ""Come back!"" ""Why?"" he shouted. ""You're in the neighbor's yard."""	"[""Why husbands shouldn't be left to trim trees alone.""]"
