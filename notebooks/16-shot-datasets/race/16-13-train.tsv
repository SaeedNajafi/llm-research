"Question: The writer's purpose in writing this passage is _ . Context: Nine years ago, after Leo had died, people said to me. ""I never knew he was your stepfather."" You see, I never called him that. At first, he was no one special in my life. Then he became my friend. In time, I felt he was also my father. Leo married my mother when I was eleven. Two years later we moved into a house in a new suburban development, where we put down roots. At first our lawn was just a mud with wild grass, but Leo saw bright possibilities. ""We'll plant trees there to give us shade as well as some flowers,"" he said. And just these little touches made our house different from all the others. More important, a real family was forming. Leo was becoming a full-time parent, and I was learning what it meant to have a father. Weekday mornings when the weather was bad, Leo often drove me to school. Having a father drop you off may have been something my classmates took for granted, but I always thought it was wonderful. Saturday mornings, we went to the hardware shop, then stepped into the five-and-ten, buying a sports magazine or something else. Some people might think that doing shopping together is nothing special, but I, who had ever before spent my childhood watching other families do their everyday activities, experienced them now with extreme delight. Looking back, I realized that Leo gave me what I needed most--the experience of doing ordinary things together as a family. Soon after we moved to the suburbs, one of our new neighbors introduced herself to me. She had already met my mother and Leo. ""You know,"" she said, ""you look just like your father."" I knew she was just making conversation--but even so... ""Thank you"", I said. Why tell her anything different? </s>"	to show his pride to have a good stepfather </s>

"Question: ""Our server was down"" is perhaps a lie told as an excuse for not _ . Context: Britain's most popular lie has been disclosed, with one in four people admitting using ""Sorry I had no signal"" when returning a missed mobile phone call, a survey found. Researchers found the average Briton tells on average four lies every day or almost 1500 every year. Almost one in six men admitted they were most likely to lie to their wife or girlfriend, on average at least twice a day. The most popular lie was saying you had no mobile phone signal, with one in four people admitting regularly using the little white lie. It usually came after they hit the ""ignore"" button when their mobile rang. Three quarters of people think women are better liars. The research found 46 per cent of girls have been caught lying, compared to 58 of men. The second most common fib is ""I haven't got any cash on me"" when asked for money by tramps , beggars and Big Issue sellers. ""Nothing's wrong - I'm fine"" came third followed by ""You look lovely"" and ""Nice to see you"". Modern technology turned out to have contributed to many lies with ""I didn't get your text"" in 18th, ""Our server was down"" in 20th and ""My battery died"" in 26th place. Other lies to make the top ten included ""I'll give you a ring"", ""We're just good friends"" and ""We'll have to meet up soon"". ""I'm on my way"" and ""No, your bum doesn't look big in that"" completed the top ten. Men tell the most fibs, coming out with five every day compared to women who lie just three times. In many cases perhaps it is better to flatter with a fib than destroy someone with the truth, according to a spokesman for OnePoll, which carried out the research of 4,300 adults. </s>"	responding to an e-mail </s>
Question: What is the main idea of the article? Context: Sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid that crashed on Earth led to the disappearance of the largest animals that have ever walked our planet - the dinosaurs. At least, this is what some scientists believe. But that accident happened so long ago. People have come to believe that we are free of threats from asteroids and everything else from space. However, what happened on Feb 15 , 2013 was a reminder that we're just as _ as the dinosaurs once were. Two objects from space - a meteor and an asteroid called 2012 DA14 - visited Earth's atmosphere on the same day. The former fell in Russia, injuring 1,200 people, while the latter passed by Earth at a record-setting close distance. Scientists had been expecting the asteroid since last year, but the meteor was a surprise. NASA's telescope system only detects asteroids at least 50 meters in diameter , which is just about the size of 2012 DA14. But the meteor was much smaller, which made it harder to spot. But what if we do spot an asteroid that is headed right for Earth? There are several possible ways in which dangerous asteroids could be made to change its orbit. Which method is best depends on several factors and most importantly - how much time we have to stop it. If there is enough time before the hit, we can send off a heavy spacecraft to travel alongside the asteroid. The gravity from the spacecraft would gradually change the rock's orbit. Besides that, scientists could one day use sun-powered lasers to either make asteroids disappear or change their course. If there's not enough time, we'll have to go after the asteroid with a spacecraft and change its orbit with a crash. Finally, if things are truly desperate, there will be only one choice left - to use a nuclear bomb. That could turn the asteroid into a meteor shower, which would be even more dangerous. </s>	The threats of objects from space and possible solutions. </s>
Question: What is mainly described in the text? Context: In Asia,there are special competitions where kites have complex designs and are fitted with instruments that make musical sounds as the wind blows through them.Although all kites have a similar structure ,they are widely different in size and shape.Kitefighting competitions are also held,in which competitors use their kites to attack and bring down their opponents' kites or cut their strings . For more than 15 years,the Big Wind Kite Factory has been giving kitemaking and kiteflying classes for the children on an island in Hawaii.In its kitemaking lessons,students can make kites in as little as 20 minutes!Children as young as four years old can learn how to fly a kite.Jonathan Socher and his wife Daphne started the kite factory in 1980.Their kites are made of nylon .Their designs are Hawaiian themes created by Daphne.The designs are cut out of the nylon with a hot knife that seals the edges and then fastened directly onto the kite. The kite that is used to give lessons is a regular diamond kite with a rainbow pattern.The difference between this kite and the ones they make during the lessons is that it is a twostring controllable kite.Big Wind employees fly the kite and for a few minutes show students how pulling on one line and then on the other controls the direction the kite goes in.Then the controls are given to the students. Jonathan insists that it is not necessary to make a huge impressive kite to have fun making and flying kites.Even the simplest structure can work,and can give hours of fun.Go on,give it a try!

"Question: The best title for the passage is "" _ "". Context: In Yemen, you always see one type of vehicle on the road: the water truck.They travel mountain roads and cross deserts to bring Yemenis the goods more valuable than oil.It is one that only the rich can afford, with the supply regularly being cut off.Others must rely on scarce rain or charity to fight thirst. Experts say Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water.The capital, Sanaa, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025,says a report by the World Bank. Hannan, an 18yearold from Lahej, said that only the rich could prepare for cuts in supply.""In a good week we'll have a water supply all week but then the following week there will be water only for a day or two, "" she said. She and her husband, a factory worker, pay 3,000 riyals (99yuan) for a week's supply of water from a touring water truck when the taps run dry.With an income of only 20,000 riyals (660yuan) a month,this means the family often spend half their money on water. ""There are a lot of people who can't afford it and they have to rely on their neighbors to help,"" she said. The average person in Yemen survives on onefifth of what the World Health Organization considers to be enough water. In Taiz, in the south,tap water is available only once every 45 days.In the mountainous Malhan district in the north,women and children climb a 1,500m mountain to collect water from a spring, often in the small hours to avoid long queues. Yemen is located in Southwest Asia,bordering the Arabian and Red Sea.Yemeni people have lived on scarce water supplies for thousands of years but that problem has been made serious by conflict in the area,the fastgrowing population and the use of water to grow a drug called qat.With one of the world's highest rates of population growth--3.46 percent, Yemen is the poorest Arab country. The government is considering desalinating seawater,but this would be expensive and it may now be too late.The only other solution is to cut down on farming, but that means importing even more food. </s>"	No water for Yemen </s>

Question: Who do you think the passage is written mainly for? Context: A graded reader is a book containing simplified languages used to help learners master the language. Readers come in different levels, from beginners to advanced. English learners need to choose a reader that is suitable for their level. Why use readers? Lots of research shows that extensive reading improves all aspects of language learning, including vocabulary, speaking skills, fluency ,writing skills and reading comprehension. prefix = st1 /Reading is a way of learning English without classes or a teacher. It helps develop learner independence. And while reading graded readers, learners don't have to run to a dictionary because the language is at their level. How do I get started? The entire class can read the same book or different books at different times. How do I know the right level? If your class is all reading the same book, choose one that is appropriate for their level. If your students are reading different books, you can have a selection of books at different levels. In this case, don't worry too much about the level. A learner who is interested in detective stories might read a higher level book if the motivation is there. How to read the book depends on students' age, motivation and class time available. Some classes like to read silently, others like to read aloud in small groups and some enjoy being read to by the teacher. Be sensitive to the class and ask for their opinions. Some pre-reading activities are needed. Before students open a book, it is important to spark interest in the story and in the whole process of reading. For example, ask them to guess what the story is from cover, chapter titles and let students put them in the best order, or discuss the author. During reading, choose a suitable chapter or chapters that can be broken down to make a comic strip . Or students select a part of the book to make into a radio play. Students can also become journalists and report on parts of the story. Choose a piece of action and have students write it up. Besides, students can role-play an interview with a character. </s>	Teachers. </s>
Question: Which of the following statements is true according to the passage? Context: We humans love to scare ourselves. Newspapers and TV news are full of shock-horror stories about the killer flu virus but are there things we can do to cut our risk of catching it? Every year, people in Britain catch the flu virus and some of those who are already ill, or are very young, may die. It is very sad, but modern treatment means that many deaths can be avoided. Experts tell us that the world is another flu epidemic and that the latest bird-flu virus would be the most likely cause. Humans can catch the disease only after closely contacting with a sick bird. However, if someone who had normal flu was to come into contact with bird flu, this could be very dangerous. The bird flu virus could attach itself to the human flu virus, _ and then start to spread from person to person. Coughs and sneezes always have spread diseases, especially colds and flu, and they still do. If bird flu does begin to infect humans, it will spread through coughs and sneezes. If you want to stay free of flu and someone coughs or sneezes at you, what should you do? First, keep your hands away from your face and wash them and your face as soon as you can. If a cough or a sneeze spray misses your face and you accidentally touch a droplet with your hands and then touch your face, the flu or cold bug could creep into your system. </s>	The person who has normal flu and comes into contact with bird flu can easily get Bird flu. </s>
"Question: The Internet has a history of more than _ years. Context: Everyday we talk about and use the Internet, but how many of us know the history of the Internet? Many people are surprised when they find that the Internet was set up in the 1960s. At that time, computers were large and expensive. Computer network didn't work well. If one computer in the network broke down, then the whole network stopped. So a new network system had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way computer network system would keep on working on the time. At first the Internet was only used by the government, but in the early 1970s, universities, hospitals and banks were allowed to use it too. However, computers were still very expensive and the Internet was difficult to use. By the start of the 1990s, computers became cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed software that made ""surfing"" in the Internet more convenient. Today it is easy to get on-line and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day. Sending e-mail is more and more popular among students.The Internet has now become one of the most important parts of people's life. </s>"	fifty </s>
"Question: The author usually imagined a reporter as one who _ . Context: My mind seems always to return to the day when I met Carl. The city bus stopped at a corner to pick up the daily commuters (someone who travels regularly to and from work), a group in which I was included. Boarding the bus, I looked for a place to sit. At last, I found a place near the back. The man in the seat next to the one I was going for was an older man in a grey suit, well-worn dress shoes, and a black hat like I always pictured reporters wearing, but without the little press card. Seated, I began to read the book I had been carrying, which was Jack Kerouac's On the Road. The man in the seat next to me introduced himself by asking if I had read any other book like the one I was holding. When I told him I had, he seemed to become interested, and so did I. He introduced himself as Carl and asked if I liked jazz, and I told him that I didn't really listen to it, and that I liked rock and roll. Waiting for Carl to tell me that I should listen to real music, I was shocked when he just smiled and nodded. He said, ""You remind me of myself when I was your age. I remember how my parents hated jazz and how they couldn't see how I could listen to that awful noise. I bet your parents say the same thing, don't they?"" Now it was my turn to smile, amused with how right he was. As the bus carried us from one side of the city to the other, Carl and I talked about a lot of different things. The more we talked, the more amazed I became at how much the two of us really had in common, despite the age difference. I haven't seen him since we parted, but the thought of our connection that day rarely leaves my mind. Carl really made me think about how much we can learn from each other if we just break through the blocks between us we've got. I mean, I would have never thought before that day that I could have anything in common with someone so much older than I. But Carl taught me that no matter what we are, we are all just people, and that we should make an extra effort to try and get to know our neighbors and people we see every day, regardless of age, race, religion, sex, or anything else. If we all take the time to attempt to understand each other, I think that the world would be a much better place that we could share together, as humans. </s>"	usually wore a black hat and press card </s>
