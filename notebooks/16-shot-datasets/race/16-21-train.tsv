"Question: Which of the following is NOT true about the newly found ring? Context: Astronomers recently found another ring around the planet Saturn -- and it's the biggest one yet. This newly discovered ring stretches about 15 million miles across, which makes a loop big enough to fit a billion Earths inside. It may be even bigger and reach 22 million miles across at its diameter . Saturn's new ring is now the biggest known ring in the solar system. This ring, like Saturn's other rings, is not one solid piece of rock. Instead, it is made up of millions or billions of tiny rocks that orbit the planet all together and give the appearance of a unified ring. Unlike the more visible rings, however, this big one is mysterious -- the pieces are far apart, and the ring cannot be seen from the surface of the Earth. If all the pieces were stuck together, they'd be slightly bigger than a rock a half-mile wide. Astronomers suspect that the newly discovered ring gets its material from Saturn's outermost moon, Phoebe. For example, the dust in the ring circles Saturn in the same path and the same direction as Phoebe. Plus, the surface of Phoebe is marked with holes and places where rock has been knocked away, the result of collisions between Phoebe and other moons and rocks. These collisions could have sent dust out into space to become part of the big ring. The discovery of the ring could help explain other mysteries surrounding Saturn and its dozens of moons. The moon called Iapetus, for example, is two-toned: one side is gray; the other more reddish. Iapetus is within the newly discovered ring, but it orbits in the opposite direction. As a result, some researchers say, debris from the ring may have coated and color1ed one side of Iapetus as it moved through space, and left the other side alone. ""The cause of Iapetus' strange color1 distribution ... has been a puzzle that now seems solved,"" said Joseph Burns, a scientist. But not everyone agrees. Some think the ring alone may not be able to explain Iapetus' funny color1ing. </s>"	It can be seen from the Earth. </s>
Question: Which of the following is true? Context: White bread is thought to have a long history.In ancient Egypt, people discovered white bread about 8,000 years ago. There is something interesting about white bread.In the old times,many cities in ancient Greece said they owned the best quality.In the middle ages,bakers in England carefully _ their secrets of making bread.Anyone who hoped to learn the art of making bread must spend seven years on it.In times of war and disasters ,bread and wheat were the first things to bekept closely.

"Question: We learn that compared to Americans, Australians _ . Context: Once upon a time, there was a scholar who wanted to gain more knowledge each day even though he had already gained enough knowledge. One day, he came to visit a saint and wanted to be his student. The saint provided some tea. He slowly filled the scholar's cup: the cup was full, yet he kept pouring and pouring. The scholar burst out, ""Stop! You can't add anything to something that's already full!"" The saint set down the teapot and replied, ""Exactly."" Whether it's the silence between notes in music, or some open time in your schedule, you need space to act effectively. Yet most of us, myself included, tend to stuff as much as possible into whatever room is available-closets, schedules, budgets, relationships, and even the mind itself. However, some people know how to avoid overstuffing their life. For example, in Australia, it seemed that most people there operated at about 85% of their capacity ,unlike Americans pushing as close to 100% as possible. So when you run into Australians you know in the street, they have time to hang out and talk with you. Remember the cup: its value is in the space, the emptiness it holds. How to empty your ""cup""? Be mindful of the element of space, openness , and emptiness in your life. This includes room in a drawer, the volume of air in a kitchen, and open-mindedness in a friend. Sometimes you're just stuck with a big bucket of tasks yet to do. But at least empty the bucket faster than you fill it with new tasks. Put some space between finishing one thing and staring another. For example, after sending one email, take a breath before replying to another one. Drop the stuff you can no longer afford to _ around. At sea level, you can run with a brick in your backpack, but if you're hiking on a mountain, that brick has got to go. </s>"	spare more time for themselves </s>
"Question: The novel Unstoppable intends to inspire kids that _ .

Once he settles in and realizes his natural football ability, tragedy strikes again and he loses his leg to a deadly bone cancer. Unstoppable follows Harrison's incredible journey as he faces many challenges in his life. Tim Green says he decided to write a novel about a kid facing cancer after watching how his wife fought to survive her own illness. ""Her mental and physical toughness were more heroic to me than anything I'd ever seen in the national sports leagues,"" Green told TFK Kid Reporter Zachary J. Lewis. After watching his wife's battle, Green said, he knew he needed to write about a person who struggled through a serious illness. But because the target age for his books is teen, he needed to tell the story through the eyes of someone that age. When friends introduced Green to Jeffrey Keith, Green knew he had found the right person to help him"" capture the heroism that it takes to fight cancer"". Cancer-survivor Jeffrey Keith lost his leg to disease at age twelve, but went on to be the goalie for the Boston College Division 1 Lacrosse Team and was also the first _ to run 3,300 miles across the country. When Green heard Jeffrey Keith's story, he knew it was the perfect narrative on which to base his next book. TFK asked Keith what it felt like to read Unstoppable for the first time. ""Tim captured what it felt like for me to go through this experience and battle back,"" Keith said. ""After I read the book, Tim asked me to describe it in one word, and I said 'awesome'. Tim's work sends a message to all the kids across the country that are facing obstacles that can have nothing to do with cancer: you are all unstoppable, as long as you believe it."" </s>"	they can overcome any obstacles ahead </s>

Question: What can be a suitable title for the text? Context: If you need to spend time on the road,it's important to find ways to keep safe on your feet. Don't suppose it's your right of way. Yes, you might be crossing at the right place, at the right time, within the crosswalk area, but you are still exposed to danger. It could be a distracted driver, or a cyclist with a loose sense of traffic rules, so you could still get hurt. You can be in the right legally, but that won't be much help when you're in the hospital. Follow pedestrian signals. Just as drivers aren't supposed to speed up to beat a light when crossing through an intersection, pedestrians need to take the same care when obeying their own signals. If the hand is flashing and the countdown is into single digits ,stay where you are. Trying to outrun the flashing hand is unsafe,especially as cars try to clear the intersection before the light turns red. Give drivers enough time to stop when crossing. Don't suppose that drivers will jam on their brakes when you hit the crosswalk signals. Some provinces, such as Alberta, issue a ticket if you don't give drivers enough time to brake. Cross quickly. Once you've followed all of the other rules, and it is safe to cross the street, don't then just wander along in front of six lanes of traffic. There's no need to run or jog, but respect the drivers who respected you enough to stop for you. </s>	Tips to Keep Safe on Your Feet </s>

First, I want to tell you how proud we are. You have become a talented and accomplished young woman. You should be as proud of yourself as we are. College will be the most important years in your life. It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about. You often question ""what good is this course"".

People are not perfect, so as long as they are genuine and sincere, trust them and be good to them. They will give back. This is my secret of success -- that I am genuine with people and trust them (unless they do something to lose my trust). College is the four years where you have: *the greatest amount of free time *the first chance to be independentk%s5$u *the most flexibility to change *the lowest risk for making mistakes So please treasure your college years - make the best of your free time, become an independent thinker in control of your destiny.

"Question: According to the passage, students who date in middle school may _ Context: Students who date in middle school have significantly worse study skills. They are four times more likely to drop out of school and report twice as much alcohol and tobacco use as their single classmates, according to new research from the University of Georgia. ""Romantic relationships are a trademark of adolescence, but very few studies have examined how adolescents differ in the development of these relationships,"" said Pamela Orpinas, study author and professor in the College of Public Health and head of the Department of Health Promotion and Behavior.[: _ Z _ X _ X _ K] Orpinas followed a group of 624 students over a seven-year period from 6th to 12th grade. Each year, the group of students completed a survey indicating whether they had dated and reported the frequency of different behaviors, including the use of drugs and alcohol. Their teachers completed questionnaires about the students' academic efforts. He found some students never or hardly ever reported dating from middle to high school, and these students had consistently the best study skills according to their teachers. Other students dated infrequently in middle school but increased the frequency of dating in high school. ""At all points in time, teachers rated the students who reported the lowest frequency of dating as having the best study skills and the students with the highest dating as having the worst study skills,"" according to the journal article. Study skills refer to behaviors that lead to academic success such as doing work for extra credit being well organized, finishing homework, working hard and reading assigned chapters. ""Dating a classmate may have the same emotional complications of dating a co-worker,"" Orpinas said, ""When the couple break up, they have to continue to see each other in class and perhaps witness the ex-partner dating someone else. It is reasonable to think this could be linked to depression and divert attention from studying."" ""Dating should not be considered a ceremony of growth in middle school,"" Orpinas concluded. </s>"	have poorer academic performances </s>
"Question: A standard treatment for depression includes all the following ways EXCEPT _ . Context: Researchers invited 79 people between the ages of 18 and 50 years old who had been diagnosed with depression. 33 of the participants were offered 20 music therapy sessions, in addition to their usual treatment for depression. The other 46 participants received stan dard treatment, and acted as the control group. The one-on-one music therapy sessions each lasted 60 minutes and took place twice a week. Trained music therapists helped each participant to improvise music. On average, each participant attended 18 music therapy sessions. 29 individuals (88 percent) attended at least 15 sessions. The participants in both groups were followed up at three and six months and assessed forsymptoms of depression and anxiety. In the final analysis, researchers discovered that af ter three months of participation, individuals who received music therapy showed greatly fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, and scored better on general functioning. Although improvements still remained after six months, the difference between the groups was no longer statistically significant. Co-researcher Christian Gold, Ph.D., explained the study findings: ""Our trial has shown that music therapy, when added to standard care including medication, psychotherapy and counseling , helps people to improve their levels of depression and anxiety. Music therapy has specific qualities that allow people to express themselves and interact in a non-verbal way - even when they cannot find the words to describe their inner experiences."" Given the success of the study, researchers say it needs to be repeated with a larger sample of people, and that further research is needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of such therapy. Outside experts believe this study shows that music ther apy is an effective addition to traditional therapy and improves outcomes. Mike Crawford, M.D., said, ""This is a high-quality randomized trial of music therapy specifically for depression, and the results suggest that it can improve the mood and general functioning of people with depression."" </s>"	Music therapy </s>
Question: What did people think of girls who got tattooed in the past? Context: Every girl wants to have a great-looking tattoo design that makes them more attractive. Small and lovely tattoo designs are the path to go for girls planning to get tattooed for the first time. Nowadays, more and more females are getting a tattoo inked on their body. In the last fifteen years, tattoos have grown from being a sign of rebelliousness and trouble to a state of popular acceptance as a mark of fashion. Tattoos are permanent so you need to be sure that you like it before getting one. A great way is to have small tattoos that look beautiful as well. You can get a cherry blossom tattoo on the foot, perhaps, a hibiscus flower on the shoulder or a lovely butterfly on the lower stomach; whatever design you choose, it can definitely add to your attractiveness and charm. Deciding to get a tattoo needs careful thought and reflection. Otherwise, you could make some serious tattoo mistakes. Try to avoid big and obvious designs if possible. Another important part of choosing a tattoo design is the location. What part of the body do you want it on? Choosing a hidden location can often make the tattoo the perfect adornment . As for professional women, tattoos should normally be where they can be hidden. Most importantly, no matter what tattoo design you choose the final goal is that the design should be something you like. If you are into the tattoo and really feel passionate about it you will carry yourself in a different manner when you get it inked on your body. </s>	They thought these girls were rebellious </s>
Question: According to the passage,which part can help build up your confidence? Context: Tests can be stressful even for the most prepared students,and,unfortunately,test anxiety can actually have a negative impact on your performance.(Just having that knowledge adds to the stress,doesn't it?)Well,the following tips can help you get through your next test with much greater ease--and likely more success! Get Enough Sleep Getting 6 hours of less can put you into what's called a sleep deficit,or lack of sufficient sleep,which can actually make you less sharp mentally and thus negatively affect your performance on tests,even if you spent those missed hours of sleep studying.So it's very important for you to get all of your studying done so you can get a good night of sleep before your big day. Study Smarter Being organized with your studies can help you keep from pulling all-nighters to get all of your studying in and blowing the test because you're exhausted.How do you study 'smarter'? Make a list of the most important things you need to learn,in order of importance,and hit the items at the top of the list first.That way,if you run out of time,you're mostly covered.Make a list of all the work you have to do,estimate how much time each item will take,and compare that with the amount of hours you have available;this will tell you if you can carefully read or just skim,how many times you can afford to revise papers,and other ways to pace yourself so you can get everything done.If you're pressed for time,it's important to learn to let go of being perfect.Oh,and turn off the TV as much as possible until your tests are behind you. Visualize Success Before you fall asleep each night,it is a great way to visualize yourself taking the tests and doing wonderfully.Detailed visualizations can help you feel like you're really experiencing something,and visualizing yourself doing well is a way to 'practice' success in a way that can actually help you perform better and feel confident.Being confident as you take your exams can keep you from choking because of the stress.Visualizations can also help you to remember facts: you can create detailed scenarios that involve the information you're trying to remember,and this can help cement the facts in your memory. Stay Calm Because stress can impair your memory,it's important to stay calm before and during tests.While that's easier said than done,there are several stress relief techniques that can help you calm down quickly whenever you feel overwhelmed.For example,breathing exercise has been shown by research to reduce test anxiety,and can be extremely effective in helping you relax and reverse your stress response in a variety of situations: just take deep breaths,expanding your belly on the inhale,and let the stress come out with your exhales. </s>	Visualize Success </s>

"Question: New rules for pubs and clubs will be introduced in Britain to ban heavy drinking because _ . Context: Tough new rules for pubs and clubs - including a ban on drinking games like the infamous ""dentist's chair"" - will be introduced in Britain this year in a bid to prevent the heavy drinking culture that costs the country billions of pounds a year. Other promotions like ""all you can drink for 10 pounds"", speed drinking competitions and ""women drink free"" nights will also be forbidden. But on the other hand, a large amount of offers of cheap alcohol in supermarkets - widely regarded as one of the main sources of Britain's problems with under-age and excessive drinking - will not be affected. Doctors and health experts argue that the government has failed to use its most effective weapon, the taxation of minimum price controls on alcohol. Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he did not want to target responsible drinkers on low incomes, but that the government and the industry had a duty to act on heavy drinking. ""These practices have a real impact on society, not to mention the lives of those who just want to enjoy a good night out."" he said. The ""dentist's chair"", where drinks are poured directly into the mouth by others, was made famous by the celebrations of footballer Paul Gascoigne. That game and others that promote mass consumption will be banned from April and publicans will have to ensure free tap water is made available to the drinkers. A second set of rules enforcing compulsory ID checks and making sure smaller alcoholic measures are on sale will come into effect in October. The government says excessive drinking costs Britain up to 12 billion pounds a year and has announced that any pubs that go against the new rule will face severe punishment. Publicans and vendors could lose their licenses, be fined up to 20,000 pounds or face six months in prison. </s>"	drinking in the country costs too much </s>
