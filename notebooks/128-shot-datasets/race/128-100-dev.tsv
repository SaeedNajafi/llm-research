"Question: How was the weather when the author got up? Context: This is a true story of how my car got stuck in water and how a stranger helped me during the worst rain storm. Last Sunday, the sky was grey when I woke up. The weather report said rain was coming, but I couldn't stay home just because of rain. Around 8:00 am I had a doctor's appointment. It wasn't raining then. At 9:00 I left the doctor's office to drive to work, and it was raining hard. I just had to go about 5-6 miles down one main road to get to a nearby school, where I could stay until the rain ended. Unfortunately, the road in front of the school was flooded, and my car stopped in the middle. ""Who is going to save me?"" I wondered. I shut off the engine and turned on my flashers . I called 911. They were not helpful. I called my husband, even though he couldn't come and help me. I was also very close to a police station. But I never saw even one police car. I decided to get out of the car, since it was still pouring. My best decision of the day had been to wear rain boots. I took my umbrella and quickly got out and ran across the street to a shelter. Before long, a tow truck happened to pass by the street. The driver kindly offered to help me. At that moment, I really needed car pulled out quickly, so I trusted the stranger. He pulled my car and drove me home. After he had dropped my car off, he also helped me check the engine. He said the engine was most likely flooded, but fortunately there was no water inside the car. Although many years have passed, I still remember that stormy day and the warm-hearted stranger clearly. </s>"	Cloudy. </s>
"Question: According to the passage, it is clear that _ . Context: Mountain lions live in mountainous areas of the western prefix = st1 /United States. Lately, however, people have reported seeing them in quiet neighborhoods all across the country! Usually considered shy and seldom seen, these lions are becoming more noticeable. In addition, the lions appear to be moving east. They were even reported in the suburbs of Boston, Philadelphia, andChicago. It seems certain that these ""Kings of the mountains"" are moving. Why? Scientists are not sure. Some think that as the mountain lion population increases in the west, younger wild cats are leaving the area. These cats are searching for new homes and new places for food. ""The young males are looking for new homes,"" says Lynn Sadler, who is the director of the Mountain Lion Foundation in Sacramento,Calif.""People tend to create too many barriers, such as buildings, fences, roads, and noise. As the mountain lions seek new places and food and water sources, these barriers get in their way."" The sightings have made people increasingly watchful . Sometimes the ""mountain lions"" that people report seeing turn out to be large dogs or even house cats. But at least a few of the meetings have been real. The building of new roads, the growing of suburbs and the growing popularity of outdoor activities are all increasing the chances that people in various parts of the country may meet up with a mountain lion. Because many people are concerned about the reappearance of the American lion, an expert outlined some ways they can avoid attracting the wild cats: Never leave pets or pet food outside; properly care for farm animals; and plan public land use to enable the lions to move safely from one place to another. ""To be fair,"" says the expert, ""mountain lions are trying to regain their homes. They were here first. Now we need to find ways we can live together."" </s>"	people walking in the country may come across a lion </s>

"Question: Professor Babette Renneberg believes people feel uneasy in lifts because _ . Context: Many of us use them several times a day without really noticing. And yet the way we behave in lifts, or elevators as they are known in the US, reveals a hidden anxiety. Passengers seem to know instinctively how to arrange themselves in an elevator, like the dots on a die. With each additional passenger, the bodies shift, going into the open spaces. On your own, you can do whatever you want--it's your own little box. If there are two of you, you take different corners, creating the greatest distance. When a third person enters, you will unconsciously form a triangle. And when there is a square, with someone in every corner, a fifth person is probable going to have to stand in the middle. Why are we so awkward in lifts? ""You don't have enough space,"" says Professor Babette Renneberg, a clinical psychologist at the Free University of Berlin. ""Usually when we meet other people we have about an arm's length of distance between us. And that's not possible in most elevators, so it's a very unusual setting. It's unnatural."" But perhaps there is more to it than just social awkwardness. ""In the back of our minds we are a little anxious,"" says Nick White, an officer in New York who was unfortunate enough to be trapped in a lift for 41 hours. ""We don't like to be locked into a place. We want to get out of the elevator as soon as possible, you know, it's a frightening place to be."" During his terrible experience, he began to think of another enclosed space--a tomb. Dr. Lee Gray agrees that a sense of powerlessness is the main cause of lift anxiety. ""You're in a machine that's moving, over which you have no control. You cannot see the elevator engine, you don't know how it's working."" he says. </s>"	they have to stay too close together </s>
"Question: From this passage, the author tells us that _ . Context: The story began with a young mother who had three sons. Unfortunately, the youngest son developed slow thinking skills, not having the intelligence of his brothers. With double duty as the mother of the household, she was exhausted, so that the youngest was often the target of anger and annoyance. Bad words, such as ""you little fool"" and the like, served as a daily meal for the youngest. The words and curses he got from the mother and ridicule from friends convinced him that he was distressing and embarrassing his family. Every morning he woke up with his own face staring from the mirror reflection, he started to say quietly and sadly, ""The fool is going to school."" As adult citizens, there was compulsory military service which should be lived. Thus, the youngest son also signed up and started to follow the various tests: a medical, physical ability test and other tests. On the day of the announcement, he was called into the board of examiners. In his mind, he convinced himself that he was the fool and couldn't pass the tests this time as he entered the room with his head down. It was not expected at all. The tests turned out to have the highest praise from the board of examiners. ""Congratulations, young man! Your test results are incredible! You are really a great and talented young man. ""Words from the board of examiners became the discovery of a new side of himself that was not known in advance. Voice kept echoing in his mind, such as ""I, the great man, am in the shower"", ""The great man washes his face"", ""The talented young man again brushes his teeth"" and so on. Confidence and improved self-image came beyond usual. 20 years later, the youngest established himself as a successful businessman who was admired and respected, and received many awards. The mindset and belief are the power behind the success that is within us. Whatever we think and believe in or minds continuously, it will eventually materialize in reality.

People were so afraid of Nian that they locked their doors before evening came during the winter. One day, an old man came to a village. He told people there that Nian was afraid of three things----the color red, fire and noise. He told people to play drums and gongs, make big fires and set off fireworks to make Nian go away.

Every Saturday during our last two years of high school, we set out early in the morning with the same desire and drive we had gained while working under our father. Taking care of lawns was not exciting or high-paying, but that didn't matter. It taught me that any job was a good job and that whatever I was paid was more than I had before. A newspaper reporter once asked me how someone could possibly live on a forty-hour-a-week minimum pay. ""My father has never worked just forty hours a week, and neither have I,"" I replied. ""If you're only working forty hours, you probably don't want to do any better than you are doing.""

"Question: Which of the following best describes the author's viewpoint? Context: Things are seldom what they seem.Skim milk masquerades as cream.Anil labor-saving household appliances often do not save labor.This is the surprising conclusion reached by a small army of historians, sociologists, and home economists who have undertaken, in recent years, to study the one form of work that has turned out to be most resistant to inquiry and analysis -?namely, housework. During the first half of the twentieth century, the average American household was transformed by the introduction of a group of machines that profoundly altered the daily lives of housewives.The forty years between 1920 and 1960 witnessed what might be called the ""industrial revolution in the home"".Where once there had been a wood or coal burning stove there now was a gas or electric range.The dryer replaced the clothes-line; the vacuum cleaner replaced the broom; the refrigerator replaced the icebox and the root cellar.No one had to chop wood any more. And yet American housewives in 1960, 1970, 1980 and even 1990 continued to log about the same number of hours at their work as their grandmothers and mothers had in 1910, 1920 and 1930.The earliest time studies of housewives date from the very same period in which time studies of other workers were becoming popular--the first three decades of the twentieth century.The sample sizes of these studies were usually quite small, and they did not always define housework in precisely the same way.but their results were more or less consistent; whether rural or urban, the average American housewife performed fifty to sixty hours of unpaid work in her home every week, and the only variable that significantly altered _ was the number of small children. A half-century later not much has changed.Survey research has become much more sophisticated, and sample sizes have grown considerably, but the results of the time remain consistent.The average American housewife, now armed with dozens of motors and thousands of electronic chips, still spends fifty to sixty hours a week doing housework The only variable that significantly altered the size of that number was frill-time employment in the labor force: ""working"" housewives cut down the average number of hours that they spend cooking and cleaning, shopping and chauffeuring, to a not insignificant thirty-five, virtually the equivalent of another full-time job. </s>"	Housework is still a heavy burden for most housewives. </s>
"Question: Who would get father's fortune? Context: Long long ago, there was an old merchant who had three sons. ""To which one shall I leave my fortune?"" he wondered.

""It is a big room,"" said the eldest son. ""One coin will not buy very much,"" said the second son. But the youngest son said nothing. He stood and thought, and then he smiled, ""Come, brothers,"" he said, ""let us go to the market."" The eldest son bought straw with his coin. But one coin bought only a bit of straw. Even when he had spread it as much as he could, the straw covered only a corner of the room. The second son bought sand with his coin. But one coin bought only a bit of sand. Even when he had spread it as much as he could, the sand covered only half of the floor. ""What did you buy?"" the eldest son angrily asked the youngest son. ""You don't have any straw."" ""Yes, what did you buy?"" the second son asked angrily. ""You don't have any sand."" ""I bought this,"" said the youngest son. ""A candle!"" cried his brothers. ""What good is a candle?""

"Question: What is the best title of the passage? Context: Children with autism have difficulty with social skills and communication. They often behave in restricted and repetitive ways and have what seem like abnormally intense interests. Autism is more common in boys than girls. What causes it is not clear. Scientists are studying genes and possible environmental influences. Doctors usually cannot confirm a diagnosis of autism until a child is about three years old. Rebecca Landa is a researcher at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Maryland. Professor Landa wanted to find out what differences in development might be seen earlier. She led a new study that observed 235 babies between six and 36 months of age. ""At six months of age, the signs of some risk for developing communication and social delays, including autism, include motor delays. Like when you lay your baby on their back and you pull them by the arms gently into a seated position, the baby's head may nod back behind the shoulders, like poor head control. So that does not mean that the baby is going to have autism, but it does mean the baby needs to have some exercises to strengthen their body. And when they strengthen their body, they are better able to play with toys and engage with people, which then goes on to help them have better outcomes."" By the time a baby is one year old, signs of possible autism include difficulty in using words and not looking eye-to-eye or reaching out to other people. By 14 months, the baby might smile less and use language less. However, Professor Landa says these signs can be so small that they might be missed during a short health exam. ""It's important for parents to stay tuned into their children's development, and if a parent is concerned about a child's development, for professionals to listen to them."" The earlier parents notice delays, she says, the sooner they can begin doing simple things that may help improve their child's development. For example: talking to the child about what they are doing, commenting when the child shows them something, and playing simple games that keep the child's attention. </s>"	Watching for Early Signs of Autism in Babies </s>
"Question: Western people usually use ""cat"" to refer to "" _ "". Context: As we know, there are differences between western culture and Chinese culture. We can see differences when we pay attention to the way words are used. Let's look at the words about animals and plants. Most expressions in Chinese about the dog, for example, ""a homeless dog"", ""a mad dog"", ""a running dog"" and ""a dog catching a mouse"", have negative meanings. But in western countries, dogs are thought to be honest and good friends of humans. In English, people use the dog to describe positive actions. For example, ""you are a lucky dog"" means you are a lucky person. And ""every dog has its day"" means each person has good luck sometimes. To describe a person's serious illness, they say ""sick as a dog"". The word ""dog-tired"" means very tired. However, Chinese love cats very much. But in western culture, ""cat"" is often used to describe a woman who is cruel. There are many other examples of how ""cat"" is used differently as well. The rose is regarded as a symbol of love in both China and some western countries. People think the rose stands for love, peace, courage and friendship. And the rose is the national flower of England, America and many other countries. The words about plants and animals are used in positive or negative ways in different cultures.

Now German researchers have set up a ""smart""house, programmed to help the elderly live at home with dignity. Scientists at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute say the house combines existing technology with future-oriented technology. For example, the ""smart""bathroom has a touch screen mirror that can remind people to take their medicine, wash their hands or brush their teeth. The hardware behind Fraunhofer's electronic bathroom is not new, and the software runs on a regular personal computer. When the medicine cabinet is opened, a display in the middle of the mirror tells the person how many pills to take. The mirror is linked to a care provider, who can remotely check whether a patient at home is actually taking medicine and brushing his or her teeth. As many elderly people have arthritic conditions that make it difficult to operate water taps, the mirror also has displays that turn the water tap on or off or control the water temperature. The bathroom is only the start. Kitchens, bedrooms and all other parts of the intelligent""home will become ""user-friendly""to meet all kinds of individual needs. Sensors in doors, toilets, taps, light switches and carpets detect every activity and record them electronically. Doctors or care staff can see from the computer records what personal hygiene tasks have been completed, how often the elderly person visits the bathroom or uses the toilet. In case of an emergency, the computer automatically alerts the chosen contact person or calls the care center. </s>"	introduces a new house </s>
"Question: Who helped the writer find the subway station? Context: A trip to London My family had dreamed of a trip to London for a long time.Luckily it was possible for us to realize our dream because all of us were free on the weekend. We planned to drive into Cambridge and caught the 7:34train to Liverpool Street Station.Then my wife and I would separate from Joan,my wife's sister,to do different things and finally meet again for lunch.And after lunch,we would go to the concert. But we were late because of a thick London fog.The train had to move along so slowly that it was not until 10:30that it got there.In spite of our late arrival,Joan decided that she would go to see the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London while we went shopping.It was only after her sister had disappeared into the fog that my wife realized that we hadn't decided where we should meet for lunch.Since I had our three tickets for the concert in my pocket,this was indeed a problem.We didn't have any mobile phones at that time.There seemed to be nothing we could do except taking a taxi to the Tower of London,and try to find her there.Needless to say,we didn't find her. It was now one o'clock,and the concert began at 2:30.""Perhaps she will think of waiting outside the concert hall,""said my wife hopefully.By this time the fog was so thick that road traffic had to stop,and the only way to get there was by subway.Hand in hand we felt our way along the road to where we thought the nearest station should be.An hour later we were still trying to find it.Just when I was about to become angry,we met a blind man tapping his way confidently through the fog.With his help we found the subway station which was just fifty meters down the road. By now it was far too late to get to the concert hall before the performance began at 2:30,so we decided to return to Cambridge.It took seven hours instead of the usual two to make that journey.Nor were we able to get any food and drink on the train.We were tired and hungry. We finally reached home at ten.Opening the door we were amazed to find Joan at home; she had seen the Crown Jewels,had managed to get another ticket for concert,and had had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant.Of course,she managed to get home,too.Oh my god! </s>"	A blind man. </s>
Question: The clothes people choose to wear tell us about their _ . Context: In Britain today, is it possible to tell a person's class just by looking at him? Physical details alone tell us about health, diet and the type of work a person does. A hundred years ago the working class often looked unhealthy, small and they were either too thin or too fat. The upper classes were often tall, sporting types who were used to a good diet and looked healthy. Today living and working conditions have improved, and such descriptions are no longer true. People are taller now than a hundred years ago. Everyone in Britain today is able to have free medicine, a good diet, acceptable working conditions and enough rest and leisure. WWW.K**S*858$$U.COM The clothes people choose to wear, however, do provide information about their backgrounds. Expensive clothes look expensive and show their wearer is rich. Clothes can provide other clues as well. The upper classes appear to be less interested in fashion and wear good quality clothes in non-bright colours, made of natural material like wool, leather and cotton. Lower working-class people often choose clothes in bright colours, made of man-made materials. A sociological explanation for this would be that colour and interest are missing from their lives, and therefore any opportunity to produce this is taken. Clothes are available at a price within most people's reach. New clothes make the wearer feel good and show some degree of wealth to the outside world. Today it is the younger people who spend most money on clothes. Fashion is no longer for the upper classes and the rich. Young people from all social classes spend a lot of money on clothes. Some new fashions are started by working-class people who want to look different and feel important. They want people WWW.K**S*858$$U.COMto look at them. </s>	backgrounds </s>

Question: What can we learn about Uncle Tom in the book? Context: The novelist, Harriet Beecher Stowe, born 200 years ago, was a poor housewife with six children, and she suffered from various illnesses. Driven by the hatred of slavery, she found time to write Uncle Tom's Cabin, which became the most influential novel in American history and caused great change, both at home and abroad. Today, however, the book has a different reputation, owing to the popular image of its character, Uncle Tom, whose name has become a saying for a cowardly black man who betrays his race. But this view is wrong: the original Uncle Tom was physically and morally strong, an inspiration for black people and other oppressed people worldwide. Indeed, that was why, in the mid-19th century, Southerners attacked Uncle Tom's Cabin as a dangerously destructive book, while Northern reformers--especially black people--often praised it. The book was influential overseas too. In Russia it inspired Vladimir Lenin, who recalled it as his favorite book in childhood. It was the first American novel to be translated and published in China, and it fueled anti-slavery movements in Cuba and Brazil. The book's progressive appeal was the character of Uncle Tom himself: a strong man who is notable because he does not betray his race; one reason he gives up escaping from his plantation is that he doesn't want to put his fellow slaves in danger. And he is finally killed because he refuses to tell his master where two runaway slaves are hiding. Unfortunately, these themes were lost in many of the stage versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin. The play, seen by more people than those who read the book, remained popular up to the 1950s and still appears occasionally. But in the play, Stowe's revolutionary themes were drowned. But it doesn't have to be that way; indeed; during the civil rights era it was those who most closely resembled Uncle Tom--Stowe's Uncle Tom, not the embarrassed one of popular myth--that proved most effective in promoting progress. Both Stowe and Uncle Tom deserve our reconsideration and our respect. </s>	he helps his fellow slaves to avoid getting into danger. </s>

Shocked, her mum didn't know what to say, so she went to make some coffee. Next day, Carrie had a visitor. ""Carrie, please don't do this to me. Come back home?"" Tom begged. But was she listening? She ignored him and stepped back inside the house. The weeks went by and Tom became very depressed. There seemed little point in carrying on without her. Then one night he got into his car and drove to a nearby seaside town. After abandoning the car, he walked towards a big stone by the sea. Looking over the edge he saw the waves crashing into the bottom of the rock. His body was shaking -- then he jumped. Carrie was mad when she found out. She paced up and down smoking a cigarette. Her eyes were full of tears. It wasn't all his fault that he had become so bad tempered. He had been finding it difficult looking for another job. She then threw the cigarette to the ground, wiped away the tears and made her way up the long passage and into a room. ""Don't you ever, ever do anything like that again,""she said in a temper to the person in the room. ""I won't,""Tom said, looking up at her from his hospital bed.

Question: The example of wine is used to illustrate that _ . Context: The traditional distinction between products that satisfy needs and those satisfy wants is no longer adequate to describe classes of products. In today's prosperous societies, the distinction has become unclear because so many wants have been turned into needs.A writer, for instance, can work with paper and pencils. These are legal needs for the task.But the work can be done more quickly and efficiently with a word processor. Thus a computer is soon viewed as a need rather than a want. In the field of marketing, consumer goods are classed according to the way in which they are purchased.The two main classes are convenience goods and shopping goods.Two lesser types are specialty goods and unsought goods. It must be emphasized that all of these types are based on the way shoppers think about products, not on the nature of the products themselves. What is regarded as a convenience item in France(wine,for example)should be a specialty goods in the United States. People do not spend a great deal of time shopping for such convenience items as groceries, newspapers, toothpaste, aspirin, and candy. The buying of convenience goods may be done routinely, as some families buy groceries once a week. Such regularly purchased items are called staples. Sometimes convenience products are bought without enough thinking; someone has a sudden desire for an ice cream sundae on a hot day. Or they may be purchased as emergency items. Shopping goods are items for which customers search. They compare prices. quality, and styles, and may visit a number of stores before making a decision.Buying an automobile is often done this way. Shopping goods fail into two classes:those that are recognized as basically the same and those that are regarded as different. Items that are looked upon as basically the same include such things as home appliances, television sets, and automobiles.Having decided on the model desired, the customer is primarily interested in getting the item at the most favorable price. Items regarded as essentially different include clothing, furniture, and dishes. Quality, style and fashion will either take precedence over price, or they win not matter at all. </s>	the type of a product is determined by its consumers </s>
Question: What does the passage mainly tell us? Context: Celebrities have become a powerful influence on some people because of their social position and their economic situation. First, some people admire and imitate stars because they allow themselves to be influenced by the media. Television, radio, and magazines invade the lives of audience with a variety of shows, information, and publications about stars and their lives. For instance, Britney Spears has become the target of paparazzi . In May, Britney appeared at the front page of the most popular magazines revealing that she married her best friend in Vegas, Nevada. Media also invade stars' lives because reporters know they can get high profits from readers who buy and follow their favorite artists' news. Second, some mad audiences imitate their celebrities for their lack of confidence. Some people who are shy and lack personality may find that imitating others will cause a good impression. For example, my cousin Jenny, who lacks a social life because of her introverted personality, believes that acting and dressing like Jennifer Lopez will make her popular in high school. Finally, several fans of stars imitate them because of peer pressure. Since my niece's girl friends formed an Antonio Banderas' fan club, she had also joined the group. Although she wasn't a huge fan of his, now she collects most of Banderas' possessions. In fact, when I asked Arianna, my niece, why she was part of Banderas' fan club, she replied with a doubtful tone that she did not wish to be rejected by the other teens. In conclusion, it is true that celebrities play spectacular roles in their performances in Hollywood, which entertains many people all over the world; however, modern celebrities influence the audience to the point where their fans admire and try to imitate their lives. </s>	Why people are influenced by celebrities. </s>
"Question: Where do today's children see Donald Duck cartoons? Context: In 1933 an unknown American called Clarence Nash went to see the film-maker Walter Disney. He had an unusual voice and he wanted to work in Disney's cartoon film for children. When Walter Disney heard Nash's voice, he said, ""Stop! That's our duck!"" The duck was the now-famous Donald Duck, who first appeared in 1934 in the film, The Wise Little Hen. Donald lived in an old houseboat and worn his sailor jacket and hat. Later that year he became a star after an eight minute Mickey Mouse film. The cinema audiences liked him because he was lazy and greedy, and because he lost his temper very easily. And they loved his voice when he became angry with Mickey's eight nephews. Soon Donald was more popular than Mickey Mouse himself, probably because he wasn't a goody-goody, like Mickey. In the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, Donald and his friends Mickey, Goofy and Pluto made hundreds of Disney cartoons. He also made educational film about the place of the USA in the world, and safety in the home. Then in 1966 Donald Duck and his voice disappeared--there were no more new cartoons. Clarence Nash died in February, 1985. But today's Children can still see the old cartoons on the television and hear that famous voice. </s>"	On television. </s>

Then he added, ""Now go in and discuss with your husband which one of us you want in your home."" The woman went in and told her husband what had happened. Her husband was overjoyed. ""How nice!"" he said. ""Since that is the case, let Wealth come in and fill our home with wealth!"" His wife disagreed, ""My dear, why not invite Success?""

""Let's _ our daughter-in-law's advice,"" said the husband to his wife. ""Go out and invite Love to be our guest."" Love got up and started walking toward the house. The other two also got up and followed him. Surprised, the woman asked Wealth and Success, ""I only invited Love, why are you coming in?"" The old men replied together.

"Question: .The following aspects of the training help increase intelligence EXCEPT _ . Context: A new study has found that it may be possible to train people to be more intelligent, increasing the brainpower they had at birth. Until now,it has been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience--what psychologists call fluid intelligence--is innate and cannot be taught(though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing). But in the new study,researchers describe a method for improving this skill,along with experiments to prove it works. The key, researchers found, was carefully structured training in working memory--the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it.This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence,so the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence. First they measured fluid intelligence of volunteers using standard tests.Then they trained each in a complicated memory task--the child's card game,in which they had to recall a card they saw and heard.During the course, they needed to ignore irrelevant items, monitor ongoing performance,manage two tasks at the same time and connect related items to one another in space and time. The four groups experienced a half-hour of training daily for 8, 12, 17 and 19 days, respectively.To make sure they were not just improving their test-taking skills,the researchers compared them with control groups that took the tests without the training. The results, published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,were striking.Improvement in the trained groups was a lot greater.Moreover,the longer they trained, the higher their scores were.All performers,from the weakest to the strongest,showed significant improvement. ""Our results show you can increase your intelligence with proper training."" said Dr Jaeggi, a co-author of the paper.""No one knows how long the gains will last after training stops,"" he added, ""and the experiment's design did not allow the researchers to determine whether more training would continue to produce further gains."" </s>"	using previous experience </s>

"Question: We learn from the text that biofilms _ . Context: Scientists from England's Newcastle University have discovered that bacteria have the ability to detect smells, according to a study by the university on Sunday. The team of scientists, led by Dr. Reindert Nijland, discovered that bacteria can detect certain types of smell- producing chemicals, including ammonia that is produced by other bacteria. Once they sense the smells from other kinds of bacteria, the bacteria will gather together to form a colony and form a layer of slime in order to force the competitors out of their area. The response decreases as the distance between the two bacterial colonies increases. That slime, also known as biofilm, is one of the primary causes of infection on many medical implants . Biofilms also slow down ships and are believed to cost the marine industry millions of dollars annually. However, they can also be used to clean up spilled oil floating on the sea, as they grow strong on it. ""This is the first evidence of a bacterial 'nose'able to detect potential competitors,"" Dr. Nijland said in the August 15 statement, which confirms that bacteria possess qualities similar to four of the five senses that humans enjoy (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell), the others being touch, taste, and sight. ""The fact that bacteria formed slime when exposed to ammonia has important significance for understanding how biofilms are formed and how we might be able to use them to our advantage,"" he added. Their findings were published in Sunday's edition of biotechnology journal, and could change the way scientists look at how each of the senses developed over time. ""It was thought for a long time that smell existed only in complex living creatures,"" Dr. Nijland said. ""Now we see that bacteria are able to do the same, so the indication is that the ability may have developed even earlier."" </s>"	can be used to benefit humans </s>
Question: What can we learn about the arctic fox's diet? Context: The Arctic Fox Characteristics The arctic fox is dark gray to bluish brown in the summer. In the winter its fur is white or creamy white. It has a long bushy tail, a short nose and small, curled back ears. It has short legs and thick fur. Its short legs and nose, thick fur and small ears are adaptions that help it survive in cold climates. Because its legs are so short and its ears and nose are small, they are less exposed to the cold. The arctic fox also has thick fur and hair on its paw pads that help keep it warm. When the arctic fox is sleeping, it protects its nose from the cold by curling its bushy tail around its body. The arctic fox is about three feet long and weighs between five and fifteen pounds. Males are larger than females. Diet The arctic fox is an opportunities eater. It will eat just about whatever it comes across. It eats small mammals like lemmings and it also eats birds, insects and eggs. In fact, in the winter it often follows polar bears and wolves and eats their leftover kill. In the summer the arctic fox will carry extra food to its den and store it under rocks to eat later. The arctic fox sometimes even makes its own freezer by digging a hole in the permafrost and storing its food there. A major source of food for the arctic fox is the lemming. In fact, the arctic fox population often peaks every four years in a cycle that follows lemming population changes. Life Cycle The arctic fox mates between February and June. The female builds a new den and gives birth to between six and twelve dark--furred kits. Both the female and the male will take care of the young kits. The male will guard the den and bring food to the den for the mother and the kits. The kits are weaned when they are between two and four weeks old and then they will start to leave the den. </s>	It eats the leftovers of other animals in winter </s>
"Question: If you register your cell phone number with ID information, _ . Context: If you want to get a new cell phone number, don't forget to bring your ID with you . As of September 1, people have to register with their ID to buy a new cell phone number. You can show your ID card orhukou, but student ID's won't work. If you already have a cell phone number, it is better to register it before 2013. The new rules are meant to prevent junk messages and fraud through cell phones. A cell phone user in China on average received 43.3 messages a week in the first half of this year. According to reports, about 12 of those were junk messages. In a survey, about 74.5 percent of users said they have received fraudulent messages. If all people register their cell phone number with ID information, it will be easier for police to find the people behind those messages. Situations in other countries Because cell phone are getting more and more popular, many countries have made stricter cell phone rules. Countries like India, Japan, Australia, and Singapore all ask users to register their ID information. Ulrich Mller is a German living in Beijing. ""In Germany, you have to show your ID when you buy a cell phone card,"" he said. ""The rules have been there for a long time. Most people know about it.""

"Question: We can infer from the article that _ . Context: When a big exam is coming up, you probably feel anxious about any wasted time and want to begin school as soon as you probably can. But tens of thousands of British high school students will soon be getting up later. They're taking part in a new experiment by Oxford University to see if later classes can improve their exam results. Grades 10 students in the UK have to take the nationwide General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) exams. They have to pass these exams in order to study more advanced courses, and later apply for universities. The Oxford University project means that GCSE students from more than 100 schools across England will start school at 10 am, more than one hour later than the current start time (8:50 am). The project is based on scientific evidence that teenagers are ""out of sync "" with traditional school hours, the Telegraph reported. And what they need is more sleep in the morning. ""We know that something funny happens when you're a teenager, in that you seem to be out of sync with the world,"" said professor Colin Epsie, who is leading the study. ""Your parents think it's because you are lazy and opinionated and everything will be OK if you could get to sleep earlier. But science is telling us that teenagers need to sleep more in the mornings."" Everyone follows a natural cycle of sleep and wakefulne ss. Biology has decided that teenagers go to sleep around midnight and don't feel fully awake until 9-10 am, according to scientists. That's two hours later than adults. And their body clocks stay like this until the age of around 21 for males, and 19 for females. ""Society provides school for learning, but the brain provides sleep. So we are exploring the possibility that if you delay the schools start time until 10 am, that will improve learning performance,"" said Epsie. The results could be positive, based on previous studies. An early study at the UK's Monkseaton High School in 2009 found that starting an hour later improved grades in core subjects by 19 percent. The Oxford project is expecting to publish the results in 2018. It's time to wait and see whether scientists will give us an excuse to get up late. </s>"	children and adults have different natural cycles of sleep and wakefulness </s>

Between 40 and 50 of the dolphins appeared in the busy port on Tuesday morning,obviously drawn by the fishrich waters of Haifa Harbor. However,the bay is also full of harmful chemicals. Aviad Sheinin,professor of Haifa University's Maritime Studies Department,said he didn't think the dolphins were harmed by the pollution,but he hoped that they would swim back to the sea soon.

"Question: To study English well, we have to _ . Context: It's over three years since I began to learn English. I'm glad that I am getting on well with it. I find English quite difficult, but very interesting. When I first started, I thought I had only to remember the new words and learn some grammar I knew little about English idioms .I thought each English word had the same meaning in Chinese. When I learn to say""I see a book on the desk,"" I thought the English word ""see "" was just like the Chinese word "" kan "",So one day when my teacher asked me,"" what are you doing?"", I answered, ""I'm seeing a book."" ""That's wrong ."" the teacher said, ""you don't see a book, You read a book. You can't use English word like a Chinese one.. Be sure not to make the same mistake again."" After that I began to pay more attention to the differences between Chinese and English. For example, in English we say a"" high mountain"", but a"" tall man. "" In Chinese we use the same word ""gao "" for both.. Again in English we say"" take part in the sports meeting "", "" attend the meeting "" and"" join the army,"" while in Chinese we can use ""can jia "" for all three. Interesting ,isn't? So to study English doesn't only mean hard wok, it can be great fun, too! We not only have to pay attention to pronunciation, grammar spelling and handwriting, we also have to understand English idioms. We can learn English well only in the way!

Question: What aspect of diversity does Valerie Gauthier think is most important? Context: Picture a typical MBA lecture theatre twenty years ago. In it the majority of students will have conformed to the standard model of the time: male, middle class and Western. Walk into a class today, however, and you'll get a completely different impression. For a start, you will now see plenty more women--the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, boasts that 40% of its new enrolment is female. You will also see a wide range of ethnic groups and nationals of practically every country. It might be tempting, therefore, to think that the old barriers have been broken down and equal opportunity achieved. But, increasingly, this apparent diversity is becoming a mask for a new type of conformity. Behind the differences in sex, skin tones and mother tongues, there are common attitudes, expectations and ambitions which risk creating a set of clones among the business leaders of the future. Diversity, it seems, has not helped to address fundamental weaknesses in business leadership. So what can be done to create more effective managers of the commercial world? According to Valerie Gauthier, associate dean at HEC Paris, the key lies in the process by which MBA programmes recruit their students. At the moment candidates are selected on a fairly narrow set of criteria such as prior academic and career performance, and analytical and problem solving abilities. This is then coupled to a school's picture of what a diverse class should look like, with the result that passport, ethnic origin and sex can all become influencing factors. But schools rarely dig down to find out what really makes an applicant succeed, to create a class which also contains diversity of attitude and approach--arguably the only diversity that, in a business context, really matters. Professor Gauthier believes schools should not just be selecting candidates from traditional sectors such as banking, consultancy and industry. They should also be seeking individuals who have backgrounds in areas such as political science, the creative arts, history or philosophy, which will allow them to put business decisions into a wider context. Indeed, there does seem to be a demand for the more rounded leaders such diversity might create. A study by Mannaz, a leadership development company, suggests that, while the bully-boy chief executive of old may not have been eradicated completely, there is a definite shift in emphasis towards less tough styles of management--at least in America and Europe. Perhaps most significant, according to Mannaz, is the increasing interest large companies have in more collaborative management models, such as those prevalent in Scandinavia, which seek to integrate the hard and soft aspects of leadership and encourage delegated responsibility and accountability. </s>	Social and professional experience. </s>

Question: Which of the following applies to the management of human resources in American companies? Context: If sustainable competitive advantage depends on workforce skills, American firms have a problem. Human-resource management is not traditionally seen as central to the competitive survival of the firm in the United States. Skill acquisition is considered an individual responsibility. Labour is simply another factor of production to be hired--rented at the lowest possible cost--much as one buys materials or equipment. The lack of importance attached to human-resource management can be seen in the corporate management. In an American firm the chief financial officer is almost always second in command. The post of head of human-resource management is usually a specialized job, off at the edge of the corporate hierarchy. The executive who holds it is never consulted on major strategic decisions and has no chance to move up to Chief Executive Officer(CEO). By way of contrast, in Japan the head of human-resource management is central--usually the second most important executive, after the CEO, in the firm's hierarchy. While American firms often talk about the vast amounts spent on training their work force, in fact they invest less in the skills of their employees than do either Japanese or German firms. The money they do invest is also more highly concentrated on professional and managerial employees. And the limited investments that are made in training workers are also much more narrowly focused on the specific skills necessary to do the next job rather than on the basic background skills that make it possible to absorb new technologies. As a result, problems arise when new breakthrough technologies arrive. If American workers, for example, take much longer to learn how to operate new flexible manufacturing stations than workers on Germany (as they do), the effective cost of those stations is lower in Germany than it is in the United States. More time is required before equipment is up and running in production, and the need for extensive retraining generates costs and creates bottlenecks that limit the speed with which new equipment can be used. The result is a slower pace of technological change, and in the end the skills of the bottom half of the population affect the wages of the top half. If the bottom half can't effectively make the processes that have to be operated, the management and professional jobs that go with these processes will disappear. </s>	They see the gaining of skills as their employees' own business. </s>
Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? Context: As is known to us, Washington University in St. Louis became the first college in the United States to ban selling bottled water in 2009. Since then, more than a dozen small colleges and schools have done the same. The ban isn't because the schools don't want students to have easy access to water. Instead, the goal is to encourage students to bring reusable bottles to save money and, more importantly, to save the environment. Many people believe that producing and using bottled water not only wastes money but also harms the environment. They say that bottled water is unnecessary because public water supplies in the U.S. are among the best in the world. These people believe that water fountains and reusable bottles with easy access to filling stations are a better choice. But the makers of bottled water argue that plastic bottles make up a small part of the nation's total waste. They say it's unfair to single out their product when so many other items are packaged in plastic containers, and what's more, water is a healthy choice compared to some sodas and juices that are also sold at school. What do you think: Should sales of bottled water be banned from schools? We want to hear your opinion. Write a 200-word response. Send it to tfkasks4you@timeforkids.com . Your response may be published in a future issue of Time For Kids. Please include your grade level and contact information for your parent or teacher if you want your response to be published.

"Question: Can you infer where this passage is from? Context: It's time to be water efficient! As populations increase across Australia and the rest of the world, demand for water will also increase. If we don't reduce each individual's demand for water (both directly and through embodied water) the water situation will become dire. It is obvious that we cannot increase demands for water much more without detrimental effects to the environment, society and the economy. It's all too easy to blame someone else for the water situation -""if 70% of water is used for agriculture then that's what we should target"" - but it's not that easy. We all depend on the food and resources that agriculture provides, and while there are definitely opportunities to increase water efficiency on the farm, the solution will take more than that. We each share responsibility for the sustainable management of our water resources, which means using less water at home, in the workplace, at school, on holidays, on the farm, ... everyone, everywhere, every time. It's time to become water efficient! This involves reassessing our relationship with water, and learning to use it more sparingly. On the most basic level, it requires a behavioural change, and assigning a value to water that truly reflects its worth. We can also unlock economic benefits of being water efficient. There are many real world examples given in the case studies on this site. Everybody has a responsibility to save water, if future generations are to enjoy a similar standard of living to the one we enjoy now. In fact, many of the impacts associated with water use are likely to have an effect on our own lives! www.savewater.com.au has been designed to help you respond to the challenge to become water efficient.

"Question: The passage is mainly concerned with _ . Context: At age 61, identical twins Jeanne and Susan no longer look exactly alike. Susan smoked for many years and is an admitted sun worshipper, whose habits Jeanne does not share. A new study of twins suggests you can blame those coarse wrinkles, brown or pink spots on too much time in the sun, smoking, and being overweight. Because twins share genes, but may have different exposures to environmental factors, studying twins allows an ""opportunity to control for genetic susceptibility ,"" Dr. Elma D. Baron, at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, and his colleagues explain in the latest issue of Archives of Dermatology. Their analysis of environmental skin-damaging factors in 65 pairs of twins hints that skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors. But when it comes to skin cancer, the researchers say their findings support previous reports that both environment and genes affect skin cancer risk. Baron's team examined facial skin of 130 twins, 18 to 77 years old, who lived mostly in the northem Midwest and Eastern regions of the US, who were attending the Twins Days Festival in Ohio in August 2002. At this time, each of the twins also separately reported how their skin burned or tanned without sunscreen, their weight, and their history of skin cancer, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The study group consisted of 52 fraternal and 10 identical twin pairs, plus 3 pairs who were unsure of their twin status. From these data, the researchers noted strong ties, outside of twin status, between smoking, older age, and being overweight, and having facial skin with evidence of environmental damage. By contrast, sunscreen use and drinking alcohol appeared related to less skin damage. Baron and his colleagues say the current findings, which highlight ties between facial aging and potentially avoidable environmental factors--such as smoking, being overweight, and unprotected overexposure to the sun's damaging rays--may help motivate people to minimize these risky behaviors. </s>"	aging skin and environmental factors </s>
"Question: The passage is mainly about _ . Context: Grown-ups know that people and objects are solid. At the movies, we know that if we reach out to touch Tom Cruise, all we will feel is air. But does a baby have this understanding? To see whether babies know objects are solid. T. Bower designed a method for projecting an optical illusion of a hanging ball. His plan was to first give babies a real ball, one they could be expected to show surprise in their faces and movements. All the 16 to 24-week-old babies tested were surprised when they reached for the illusion and found that the ball was not there. Grown-ups also have a sense of _ . We know that if we put a box in a room and lock the door, the box will still be there when we come back. But does a baby realize that a ball that rolls under a chair does not disappear and go to never-never land ? Experiments done by Bower suggest that babies develop a sense of object permanence when they are about 18 weeks old. In his experiments, Bower used a toy train that went behind a screen. When 16-week-old and 22-week-old babies watched the toy train disappear behind the left side of the screen, they looked to the right, expecting it to re-appear. If the experiment took the train off the table and lifted the screen, all the babies seemed surprised not to see the train. This seems to show that all the babies had a sense of object permanence. But the second part of the experiment showed that this was not really the case. The researcher substituted a ball for the train when it went behind the screen. The 22-week-old babies seemed surprised and looked back to the left side for the train. But the 16-week-old babies did not seem to notice the switch . Thus, the 16-week-old babies seemed to have a sense of ""something permanence,"" while the 22-week-old babies had a sense of object permanence related to a particular object. </s>"	babies' understanding of objects </s>

They can be found almost all over the world, and there are more than 2,500 kinds of them. No one likes the mosquito. But the mosquito may decide that she loves you. She? Yes,she. It's true that male mosquito doesn't bite and only the female mosquito bites because she needs blood to lay eggs. She is always looking for things or people she wants to bite. If she likes what she finds, she bites. But if she doesn't like your blood,she will turn to someone else for more delicious blood. Next time a mosquito bites you,just remember you are chosen. You're different from the others! If the mosquito likes you,she lands on your body without letting you know. She bites you so quickly and quietly that you may not feel anything different.

Question: Which of the following do intellectual property rights not cover? Context: You wouldn't steal a car. You would never rob a bank or pick someone's pocket. But you may be another kind of thief. If you have ever bought a disc for 15 yuan or less, then you have helped to rob artists or musicians of their intellectual properly rights . Last Thursday was World Intellectual Property Day. Activities to tell people about intellectual property rights were held around the country. Intellectual property includes inventions, literary and artistic works, names, and pictures. They are of little value if they are not read, seen and used. While the cost of copying discs is very small, authors, singers and actors have to spend a lot of money and time making a new product. That's why they have the right to make money from their work. So buying pirated music of Jay Chou and Jolin Tsai is like stealing from them, paying them no respect for their hard work. If Jay Chou cannot make money from his work, he may not make anything else. But those who make pirated goods are becoming rich without doing any hard work. The authors should ask for a fair price for their work. Earlier this year there was much talk about how much KTV clubs should pay the music companies for using their songs. The copyright fee also should be fair to the users.

Sometimes pools of water near beaches become filled with sand. When the soil under these pools does not allow for good drainage , the sand can become stretches of quicksand. Is it true that a person who steps into quicksand is doomed to die? No, for people have fought their way from quicksand to firm land again. It is panic that creates the condition that can result in death, for the more a person struggles, the worse matters become. Quick movements will make the sand yield for a time, but then it rushes back and settles solidly around the body. People trapped in quicksand should either lie back with arms outstretched, or not move at all. When the weight of the sand around his body has displaced equals that person's weight, the victim will stop sinking. With feet held still, and with slow movements of the arms, as in the backstroke in swimming, people have managed to roll to safety and reach firm ground. </s>	It is hard to keep calm if you fall into quicksand. </s>
Question: In the prefix = st1 /United States, almost half of the high school graduates _ . Context: Education in the United States is compulsory for children up to about the age of sixteen.Most young people stay in school longer than that. Most graduate from high school at the age of 17 or 18. Almost half of these high school graduates continue their education at a college or university.Education for most young people in this country is free up to the time they graduate from high school.There are private schools, but most parents send their children to public schools, where students do not pay tuition . When young people go to college, however,they must pay tuition at a public university or a private university.University costs are going up a lot:private universities have become very expensive because the government does not help them. Who pays? The parents of children in college may have to pay more,or often the students may have to find jobs.These students have to worry about assignments and grades and also about their jobs.If they work too much at their jobs they may be absent from class or miss assignments or make too many errors on tests.They may even fail their courses and have to leave the university. For many students, the problem of getting an education is not just a problem of homework and exams.They also have to make money to pay for tuition.And professors don't teach them how to do that! </s>	go to colleges and universities </s>
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that _ . Context: A global positioning system(GPS)service is aiding the elderly in the Panlong district of Kunming,capital of Southwest China's Yunnan province. The telecommunications service provider,with the support o,f the local govemment,started the GPS tracking service in January to help the elderly,especially those with Alzheimer's disease,a condition that slowly destroys memory. Huang Haiying,an employee with a local telecommunications company,told China Daily that with the GPS devices ,the people who look after the elderly can quickly find their positions either online or by ca l l ing the service center in case ot emergencles. The system is also connected to the police,hospitals,fire services and community service centers to ensure that the elderly get quick and proper help,Huang said. Experts said that this service could improve the quality of life for thousands of elderly people with Alzheimer's,their families and those who look after them. Hundreds of people have already been helped by the service this year,Huang said. Huang said that the system has about 1 0,000 subscribers and she expects that number to grow 1 0 times over the next three years.A user pays 25 yuan($4)each month for the service.A family with an income below the local poverty line can get a 10 yuan subsidy evcry month from the government. The local government has spent more than 2 million yuan to subsidize the service to date. Rao Yuehui,director of the Panlong civil affairs department,said that about 90,000 people,or 15.4 percent of the district'S population,are more than.60 years old. He Xiangqun,an official with the Yunnan provincial civil affairs department,said that this means that the population meets international standards classifying it, as an aging society as defined by the United Nations. </s>	the life quality of'the elderly in th.e Panlong district is pretty good </s>
"Question: The existence of the privately owned mass media depends on the support of _ . Context: In the West, advertisements are the fuel that makes mass media work. Many TV stations, newspapers, magazines, radio stations are privately owned. The government does not give them money. So where does the money come from? From advertisements. Without advertisements, there would not be these private businesses. Have you ever asked yourself what advertising is? Through the years, people have given different answers to the question. For some time it was felt that advertising was a means of ""keeping your name before the public"". And some people thought that advertising was ""truth well told"". Now more and more people consider it in this way: Advertising is the paid, non-personal, and usually persuasive presentation of goods, services and ideas by some certain sponsors through various media. First, advertising is usually paid for. Various sponsors pay for the advertisements we see, read, and hear over the various media. Second, advertising is non-personal. It is not face-to-face communication. Although you may feel that a message in a certain advertisement is aimed directly at you, in fact, it is directed at large groups of people. Third, advertising is usually persuasive. Directly or indirectly it asks people to do something. All advertisements try to make people believe that the product, idea, or service advertised can benefit them. Fourth, the sponsors of the advertisement must show their names. From the advertisement, we can see if the sponsor is a company, or a single person. Fifth, advertising reaches us through old and modern mass media. Included in the old media are newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and films. Modern media include emails, matchbox covers, and boards on top of buildings. </s>"	advertisements </s>

Wikipedia is ranked among the ten most popular websites and is considered the Internet's largest and most popular general reference book. Now, Wikipedia is becoming Wookiepedia as scientists hope the informative website will help us reach out to intelligent life forms. So aliens can learn about the human race. Astronomers would like to beam the entire contents of Wikipedia into space in the hope of contacting aliens. They want to send messages to hundreds of star systems and planets 20 light years away using radio telescopes. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute, in California, wants to use powerful radio telescopes to try to reach Chewbacca and his mates in a galaxy far away. The plans will be discussed by astronomers at the weekend as some scientists fear the reply from ET might not turn out to be friendly. Institute scientist David Black said, ""One question is if there are dangerous creatures we might be drawing their attention to ourselves. Another is if we go ahead, what message should be sent?

"Question: Which of the following words best describes the boy? Context: John had been on a business trip for three weeks. It was coming up on Mother's Day, and he usually tried to go back home, but this time he was too tired. He was in a small town outside of Little Rock when he drove by a flower shop. He decided to send his mother some roses. He went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. ""How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?"" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe he should be happy with carnations . ""No, I have to have roses,"" he said, ""My mom was sick so much last year and I had little time with her. It has to be red roses, 'cause that's her favourite."" The florist shook her head. John was touched by the boy, who wanted to get those roses so badly. John looked at the florist and silently mouthed that he would pay for the boy's roses. Then the florist said, ""Ok, I will give you a dozen red roses for your six dollars."" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement. John ordered his own flowers and had the florist be sure that delivery would include a note telling his mother how much he loved her. Then he drove away from the shop. As he waited at the light, he saw the young man crossing the street and enter a park through two huge gates. Suddenly, he realized it wasn't a park. It was a cemetery . The light changed, and John slowly crossed the road, parked his car and got out to follow the boy down the fence. The boy stopped by a small monument and went on his knee. He carefully laid the roses on the ground and cried, ""Mommy, why didn't I tell you how much I love you?, Jesus, please. Tell my mommy I love her."" John turned, tears in his eyes, and walked back to his car. He drove quickly to the flower shop and told the florist he would take the flowers personally. </s>"	Poor </s>

"Question: We can describe Greg as _ . Context: The story of the day I lost my best friend to a car accident. The day a precious life was taken from us way too soon. It was a bright and Sunny day in November. Thanksgiving had been celebrated only two days before. Since it was a holiday weekend I had been on the phone with Greg the night before many times. His dad didn't want him to come over because of the holiday. I guess he finally wore him down and he called and said, ""I can stay"". So, my mom, brother, and I went to pick him up. He was always smiling. The complete opposite of my shy self, Greg was always the life of the party. We got two large pizzas that Friday night. I've never known anyone in my entire life who loved to eat more than Greg. That's the way he was though. He was just enjoying life. And if it meant gaining weight or whatever, so be it. He would sit back and put his hands on his belly and just laugh. We (Greg, David, and I) did so many funny things together and had such great times. Things we should have done and things we shouldn't have done, I'll ""Never"" forget. On Saturday morning Dad took us out for breakfast. We all finished eating and followed my Dad up to the cashier. Greg asked Dad if he could have a candy bar. I looked at Greg shaking my head. He just laughed. After breakfast, Father took us to my Mom's house. When we got out at Mom's house there was no one home. So, one of us grabbed a big wheel and rode it down the steep driveway into the street. Just boys being boys. Greg and I did it several times until the last time. The car hit him on the head, knocking him around 75-- 100 yards. My brother and I both ran screaming just yelling for help and crying.

Question: According to the text, what is diapause? Context: We bet that on cold wintry days, many of you love to stay in your warm home and, every now and then, come out into the kitchen for a snack. Unfortunately, plenty of creepy-crawly critters like to do the same thing! Winter is the time when bugs invade your house without an invitation. The season can be tough for such creatures. In winter the air is cold, the ground is hard and many trees have no leaves. So bugs do what they have to do to survive. Monarch butterflies head south to warmer climates. Ants crowd in deep underground colonies and eat food they have been storing all year. Many insects go into a deep sleep called diapause. There're different kinds of diapause, but all are similar to hibernation, a time when bigger animals become inactive in the cold. Insects go into an inactive period, too, but it often isn't when the temperature drops. They rely on more dependable signals in the environment. For example, many insects can tell how much sunlight there's each day. They use that to tell themselves when to shut down. Bugs are cold-blood-ed, meaning that their inside temperature is the same as the outside. They can't move much when it gets below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. So they search for any warm place. They're looking for protection. These guys have been doing this for 300 million years, so they don't really know they're coming into your house. The home is a recent event in terms of their evolutionary behav-ior. They enter through tiny cracks or come in unnoticed on your clothes or shoes. Remember that they may be invading your homes for warmth and food, but they don't care about humans. </s>	It is a deep sleep similar to hibernation. </s>

"Question: This passage is mainly about _ . Context: Who taught you to speak English? Your parents, while you were a child? Your teacher at school? Perhaps even the BBC as a grown-up. Whoever it was, somehow you have developed an understanding of what is rapidly becoming a truly global language. There are now about 376 million people who speak English as their first language, and about the same number who have learnt it in addition to their mother tongue. There are said to be one billion people learning English now and about 80% of the information on the Internet is in English. Is this a good thing, or a bad thing? Should we celebrate the fact that more and more of us can communicate, using a common language, across countries and cultures? Or should we worry about the dangers of "" mono-culturalism"", a world in which we all speak the same language, eat the same food and listen to the same music? Does it matter if an increasing number of people speak the same language? I would have thought the other way around although I have never accepted the argument that if only we all understood each other better, there would be fewer wars. _ ... If we all speak English, will we then all start eating McDonalds burgers? Surely not. If English becomes more dominant , it will kill other languages? I doubt it. When I travel in Africa or Asia, I am always surprised by how many people can speak not only their own language but often one or more other related languages, as well as English and perhaps some French or German as well. When we discussed this on Talking Point a couple of years ago, we received a wonderfully poetic email from a listener in Ireland. ""The English language is a beautiful language. Maybe it's like a rose,"" he said. ""But who would ever want their garden just full of roses?"" Well, I love roses, and I think they make a beautiful addition to any garden. But the way I see it, just by planting a few roses, you don't necessarily need to pull out everything else. If more and more people want to plant English roses, that's fine by me. </s>"	whether we need to worry about English being a world language </s>

""What are you doing, father?"" he asked and Anansi told him."" Why don't you carry the basket on your back instead?"" his son said. Anansi put the basket on his back and climbed the tree easily, but he wasn't happy. ""I walked all over the village and collected so much wisdom that I am the wisest person ever, but my baby son is still wiser than me. Take back your wisdom!"" he said.

Question: The best title for this passage would be _ . Context: Americans are proud of their variety and individuality,yet they love and respect few things more than a uniform,whether it is the uniform of an elevator operator or the uniform of a fivestar general. Why are uniforms so popular in the United States? Among the arguments for uniforms,one of the first is that in the eyes of most people they look more professional than civilian clothes. People have become conditioned to expect superior quality from a man who wears a uniform. The television repairman who wears a uniform tends to inspire more trust than one who appears in civilian clothes. Faith in the skill of a garage mechanic is increased by a uniform. What easier way is there for a nurse,a policeman,a barber,or a waiter to lose professional identity than to step out of uniform? Uniforms also have many practical benefits. They save on other clothes. They save on laundry bills. They are taxdeductible .They are often more comfortable and more durable than civilian clothes. Primary among the arguments against uniforms is their lack of variety and the consequent loss of individuality experienced by people who must wear them. Though there are many types of uniforms,the wearer of any particular type is generally stuck with it,without change,until retirement. When people look alike,they tend to think,speak,and act similarly,on the job at least. Uniforms also give rise to some practical problems. Though they are longlasting,often their initial expense is greater than the cost of civilian clothes. Some uniforms are also expensive to maintain(,),requiring professional dry cleaning rather than the home laundering possible with many types of civilian clothes. </s>	Advantages and Disadvantages of Uniforms </s>
"Question: From the passage we know that our dreams _ . Context: Let us begin by saying what does not cause our dreams. Our dreams do not come from ""another world "". They are not messages from outside source. They are not a look into the future , either . All our dreams have something to do with our feelings, fears, longings, wishes, needs and memories. If a person is hungry , or tired or cold , his dreams may include a feeling of this kind .If the covers on your body , such as a quilt or a blanket have slipped off your bed , you may dream that you are sleeping on the ice and snow. The material for the dream you will have tonight is likely to come from the experience you have today. So the subject of your dream usually comes from something that has effect on you while you are sleeping (feeling of cold, a noise, a discomfort, etc.) and it may also use your past experiences and the wishes and the interests you have now.This is why children are likely to dream of fairies, older children of school examinations, hungry people of food, home-sick soldiers of their families and prisoners of freedom. To show you how this is happening while you are asleep and how your needs and wishes can all be joined together in a dream , here is the story of the experiment.A man was asleep and the back of his hand was rubbed with a piece of absorbed cotton.He would dream he was in hospital and his charming girlfriend was visiting him , sitting on the bed and feeling gently his hands! There are some scientists who have made a special study of why we dream, what we dream and what those dreams mean.Their explanations of dreams , though a bit reasonable, is not accepted by everyone but it offers an interesting approach to the problem.They believe that dreams are mostly expressions of wishes that do not come true.In other words, dreams are a way of having your wishes carried out. </s>"	are to some degree connected with our feelings </s>
Question: Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance _ . Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. </s>	has much to do with culture </s>
Question: The article tells us that_. Context: Steve Jobs-A surprising success. Nothing in the early years of Steve Job's life suggested that he would be so successful. Born in San Francisco, the child of two students, he was adopted and grew up close to Silicon Valley. While at company-and he and his best friend Steve Wozniak got summer jobs there. After finishing high school in 1972, Jobs studied at an expensive liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon but he dropped pout after one after one term. He grew his hair and a beard, slept on friends' floors, and sometimes went to a Hare Krishna temple for free meals. Like many drop-outs at that Beatles-inspired time, his ambition was to visit a guru([])in India, which he eventually did with a friend. When they got there, the guru had died. At this point, Jobs has a limited education, and no obvious talents, apart from a notorious ability to talk. However, he did have a devoted friend who was an electronics genius. They were a great team. Without Jobs' s ambition, high design standards, the ability to make deals and great maketing skills-Wozniak might well have spent a quiet life designing hardware at HP. </s>	Steve Jobs didn't know his real parents </s>
"Question: How can a college graduate increase his or her yearly income according to the passage? Context: As the price of a college degree continues to rise, there's growing evidence that the monetary payoff isn't quite as big as often advertised. The best estimate now is that a college degree is worth about $300,000 in today's dollars--nowhere near the million figure that is often quoted. ""That million number has driven me crazy!"" says Sandy Baum, a Skidmore economist who studied the value of a college degree for the College Board last year. Baum's research showed that college graduates earn, on average, about $20,000 a year more than those who finished their educations at high school. Add that up over a 40-year working life and the total differential is about $800,000, she figures. But since much of that bonus is earned many years from now, taking away the impact of inflation means that$800,000 in future dollars is worth only about $450,000 in today's dollars. Then, if you remove the cost of a college degree--about ,$30,000 in tuition and books for students who get no aid and attend public in-state universities--and the money a student could have earned at a job instead of attending school, the real net value in today's dollars is somewhere in the $300,000 range, a number confirmed by other studies. But, especially these days, that still makes a college degree one of the most _ investments a person can make, Baum notes. Better yet, college graduates can go on to earn advanced degrees, which return even bigger payoffs. The average holder of a bachelor's degree earns about$51,000 a year, Baum calculates. But those who've gone on to earn MBAs, law degrees, or other professional degrees earn about $100,000 a year. In addition, Baum found that there are plenty of other rewards for a degree. The quality of the jobs college graduates get is far better, for example. College graduates are more likely to get jobs with health insurance. And it is easier for them to find and hold jobs. The unemployment rate for college graduates was just 2.2 percent last year, half the unemployment level of those with only high school diplomas. There are lots of other nonmonetary benefits as well. College graduates are healthier, contribute more to their communities, and raise kids who are better prepared academically, studies show. Other researchers have found that the payoff of a degree is especially lucrative for students from low-income families, since the education and degrees give them a chance to break out of low-paying careers. </s>"	By going on for higher degrees. </s>
Question: It is hard to explain what a painter is saying because _ . Context: Every artist knows in his heart that he is saying something to the public. Not only does he want to say it well, but he wants it to be something that has not been said before. He hopes that the public will listen and understand ----he wants to teach them, and he wants them to learn from him. What visional artists like painters want to teach is easy to make out but difficult to explain, because painters translate their experience into shapes and colors, not words. They seem to feel that a certain choice of shapes and colors, out of the countless billions possible, is very interesting for them and worth showing to us. Without their work we should never have noticed these particular shapes and colors, or have felt the delight which they brought to the artists. Most artists take their shapes and colors from the world of nature and from human bodies in movement and at rest; their choices show that these aspects of the world are worth looking at, that they contain beautiful sights. Modern artists might say that they only choose subjects that provide an interesting pattern, that there is nothing more in it. Yet even they do not choose totally without thinking about the character of their subjects. If one painter chooses to paint a decaying leg and another a lake in moonlight, each of them is directing our attention to a certain aspect of the world . Each painter is telling us something, showing us something, emphasizing something - all of which means that, consciously or unconsciously, he is trying to teach us. </s>	a painter use shapes and colors instead of words </s>

"Question: Why did the master buy a lot of chilies? Context: There once was a master who went to India. In those times, we didn't have the communications or airplanes or many kinds of transportation that we do now. So the master went to India on foot. He had never been to India before; perhaps he came from Persia. And when he got there, he saw a lot of fruit. In India they have plenty of fruit to sell, but much of it is expensive because they can't grow much due to the water situation. So he saw one basket, a big basket of some very red, long fruit. And it was the cheapest in the shop, not expensive at all. So he went up and asked, ""How much per kilo?"" And the shopkeeper said, ""Two rupees ."" Two rupees in India is nothing; it's like dirt. So he bought a whole kilogram of the fruit and started eating it. But after he ate some of it: Oh, my God! His eyes watered, his mouth watered and burned, his eyes were burning, his head was burning and his face became red. As he coughed and choked and gasped for breath, he jumped up and down, saying, ""Ah! Ah! Ah!""But he still continued to eat the fruit! Some people who were looking at him shook their heads and said, ""You're crazy, man. Those are chilies ! You can't eat so many; they're not good for you! People use them as a condiment , but only a little bit to put into food for taste. You can't just eat them by the handful like that; they're not fruit!"" So the stupid master said, ""No, I can't stop! I paid money for them, and now I'll eat them. It's my money!"" And you think that master was stupid, right? Similarly, we sometimes do a lot of things like that. We invest money, time or effort in a relationship, business or job. And even though it's been a long time, bitter experience tells us it won't work, and we know there's no more hope that things will change in the future -- this we definitely know by intuition -- we still continue just because we've invested money, time, effort and love into it. Just like the man who ate the chilies and suffered so much but couldn't stop because he didn't want to waste the money he'd paid. </s>"	The price of chilies is very low. </s>
"Question: The word ""exodus"" in Para3 can be probably explained by _ Context: About 6,000doctors in theprefix = st1 /Philippinesare studying to become nurses so they can find higher-paying jobs abroad, Health Secretary Francisco Duque says. This was up from 2,000 doctors who studied to become nurses last year, Duque said. The exodus of doctors and nurses had created a ""threatening situation for our health care system"" and a task force had been established to examine the potential impact, he said. The team was working on a bill which would require doctors to practice in thePhilippinesfor at least three to four years before they were able to work abroad. ""I think the problem really is the migration of doctors. We have so many nurses now, more than enough to fill up(vacancies). But our doctors are leaving,"" Duque said. A study by the University of thePhilippineshad found that between 2000to 2003 more than 50,000 Filipino nurses went abroad to work. A doctor working in a government hospital in thePhilippinesearns only about 25,000 pesos(446 dollars) a month. A doctor could earn around 8,000dollars a month while working as a nurse overseas. Even lawyers, accountants and engineers are enrolling to brain as nurses. Filipino nurses are in demand in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and even closer to home, such as in Singapore and Japan.

After all, he has been at it for 17 years now, seven days a week. With the help of a walker, he hobbles between lanes of traffic, approaching drivers, offering newspapers --- often a free paper collected from boxes on the sidewalk nearby --and asking for change.""Help a guy out?"" he repeats to drivers who will usually hand over a dollar or some change. Most drivers simply regard him as another homeless down-and-out ,but every so often one might realize that it's the legendary comedian Professor Irwin Corey, who is now 98. Over his eight-decade career, he has been on television and in comedy clubs, nightclubs and concert halls worldwide. He began his stage career on Broadway in 1943. Indeed, he still performs fairly regularly -- a week ago he flew to Chicago to play two nights at a local club. And though he has a homeless appearance, Mr. Corey lives in a comfortable 1840 carriage house on East 36th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues that he estimates could sell for $3.5 million. Mr. Corey said he gathers his daily take-- usually about $100, though there have been $250 days-- every few months and donates the money to a charity that buys medical supplies for children in Cuba.

It's a move that first caught the attention of photographers and graphic designers a few years back when the furniture giant announced it would cancel photoshoots in favor of computer-generated imagery(CGI). Enthed said IKEA began shifting equipment in 2009 when company officials called in his team and said they weren't pleased with some previous photos and CG images. ""So we looked at all the images they said weren't good and the two of three they said were great,and the ones they didn't like were photography and the good ones were all CG,""Enthed said.""Now we only talk about a good or bad image - not what technique created it."" It's a not-so-secret strategy used by top companies specializing in home and furniture design,though many consumers remain oblivious.

Question: Where did the writer spend her vacation? Context: Our flat was on the fifth floor but you could still hear the roar of the ocean and see the stars at night. I used to take long walks along the water. The food in town was delicious and the people were very friendly. The area was very quiet and peaceful, and fairly deserted. The last evening of our vacation, however, we all heard strange footsteps following closely behind us as we were walking up to our flat in the holiday centre. We turned around and noticed a fairly young man moving very rapidly across the beach and getting closer to us. He was tall and wore a baseball cap. We couldn't see his face and he was approaching us very rapidly. The man's actions made my dad very nervous. Dad warned us that we'd better try to make it to our flat as quickly as possible. I didn't like my dad's voice; I could hear fear in it. It was late and we were all alone. We didn't have any cell phones on us. I never saw Dad as worried as he was then and I knew that something was terribly wrong. The sense of fear started to overwhelm Mom and me. We had had such a good time in town. Now, the night was rapidly turning into a dangerous situation. We could hear the man's footsteps getting closer. Dad's face was almost pale. The so-called intruder had moved nearer and nearer when all of a sudden, the nearby vending machine started going crazy and spitting out cans of soda! The noise actually scared the intruder and he ran out of sight.

"Question: Most of the time in our daily life, we _ . Context: During communication, ""words"" express only 7% of meanings between people. About 23% of meanings are from the ""tone of voice"" and 70% of meanings come from ""body language"". So next time you want someone's attention--try body language instead. Everyone does it, and most interestingly--most do it unconsciously. You may wonder: ""Does that mean I have to study psychology to succeed in reading body language?"" The answer is ""no"" because most people are already body language readers. It's a skill developed since we're babies--think of how most babies can recognize facial expressions and get attention without saying anything. That is, you needn't spend most of your time practicing some of your body language cues ! However, you should know that the context is king. It suggests that, depending on the context of the situation, people will hide body language cues. So sometimes cues can be tricky: a woman who locks her arms may think you are boring--or she may just feel cold. You must learn to read into the context as well as the cues. Sometimes people care more about their body language cues. For example, poker players will consciously hide more of their body language cues. The first place to start when reading a person's body language is the face. The easiest way to hide your feelings is to cover your face. This is why it's sometimes hard to tell if an Islamic girl likes you. If the eyes are the windows of the mind, the eyebrows are the windows of the eyes. So, notice how a person's eyebrows will generally rise when they meet someone, see something they like or are surprised at. Eyes generally smile along with the mouth when someone is happy, so everyone knows ""^ . ^"". </s>"	don't realize we're using body language </s>

It has been 50 years since Sean Connery was announced as the first man to play Bond in the film named Dr No. Do you expect Skyfall which is the 23rdfilm in the 007 series? At London's Corinthi a Hotel, the official gave a little information about the storyline: Bond's loyal attitude toward his boss Miss M will be tested when one of her past staff comes back to hurt her. As MI6 is in danger, 007 needs to solve problems and protect MI6 whatever it costs. Mendes, who won a best director Oscar for 1999's American Beauty, told fans that Skyfall would have all the features of a classic Bond movie, such as a lot of action. ""Daniel Craig is back for a third time as 007 along with Dame Judi Dench as his boss Miss M."" said Mendes. Many famous actors and actresses who have Oscar wins and nominations are included, but the filmmakers remain keeping their roles in the film secret. Producers are showing no signs of cutting off the cost of Skyfall. ""It is at the same level as the 2008's Quantum of Solace, which cost about $200m. The film will be made in the Whitehall, Scotland, China and Turkey, as well as Pinewood Studios."" Said a producer. Why has 007 been popular for so long?

"Question: Which was the main trouble my grandfather had in helping his friend? Context: My grandfather had a small farm where he raised beef and some grain for feed. He also worked diligently as a factory laborer and country pastor. He was a good neighbor and well-respected for honoring his word. When harvest time came, he'd piece together his old one-row corn picker and oil it up for the season. All his life he worked hard, helped others, and you could count on him to keep his promises. He had promised to harvest a few ribbons of corn on a friend's farm, but after harvesting his own corn, Grandpa's little corn picker coughed and quit. It would be out of commission until a particular part could be ordered, but that would take far too long to help this year. The factory where Grandpa worked began to require overtime. In order to keep his job there he had to leave the farm before dawn and get home until well after sunset. One autumn night, while harvest time was running out, he and his wife sat at the kitchen table and trying to figure a way out of their dilemma. ""There's nothing you can do,"" said my grandma. ""You'll just have to tell him that you can't help with the corn this year."" ""Well that just doesn't sit well with me,"" said my grandpa. ""My friend is depending on me. I can't exactly let my neighbor's harvest rot in the field, can I?"" ""When do you think you'd have time to do it?"" she asked. ""With the overtime you've been working you'd be up all night."" ""I know of one night that I could do it!"" he said, running to the bookshelf. He grabbed the Farmer's Almanac and started flipping through the pages. ""Aha! There's still one more full moon in October."" They say it's called the harvest moon because it gives farmers more light and more time to collect their crops. And so a few days later, after a long shift at the factory, my grandpa made his way to the field where my grandma met him in the truck with dinner. The weather was cold but clear, and the moon was brilliant. He worked through the night to keep his word.

"Question: Which of the following has not been used as a verb, yet? Context: It's not a new phenomenon, but have you noticed how many nouns are being used as verbs? We all use them, often without noticing what we're doing. I was arranging to meet someone for dinner last week, and I said ""I'll pencil it in my diary"", and my friend said ""You can ink it in"", meaning that it was a firm arrangement not a tentative one! Many of these new verbs are linked to new technology. An obvious example is the word fax. We all got used to sending and receiving faxes, and then soon started talking about faxing something and promising we'd fax it immediately. Then along came email, and we were soon all emailing each other madly. How did we do without it? I can hardly imagine life without my daily emails. Email reminds me, of course, of my computer and its software, which has produced another couple of new verbs. On my computer I can bookmark those pages from the World Wide Web that I think I'll want to look at again, thus saving all the effort of remembering their addresses and calling them up from scratch. I can do the same thing on my PC, but there I don't bookmark; I favorite--coming from ""favorite pages"", so the verb is derived from an adjective not a noun. Now my children bought me a mobile phone, known simply as a mobile and I had to learn yet more new verbs. I can message someone, that is, I can leave a message for them on their phone. Or I can text them, write a few words suggesting when and where to meet, for example. How long will it be before I can mobile them, that is, phone them using my mobile?

Dad always told me never to ever reveal my true opinions towards other people if such opinions are negative. He said this is the ""Chu Shi Zhe Xue"", the philosophy of dealing with social network. It seems that everybody here just follows this philosophy very, very well. Friends. I would say that if I were given true friendship I would definitely treasure it with my greatest care. If I really regard someone as my close friend, I would never leave her alone whenever she's in need, either financially or mentally. And I always believe, as long as I treat people with whole-hearted honesty, I would have some rewards--at least, just ONE true friend of the same gender . Sometimes I just miss my friends in China. Perhaps when we became friends, we were still young, too young to have been polluted by any dirt in the society. But here, it is simply different. It seems that all of us have learnt how to SURVIVE in a foreign land and such an experience actually makes us learn how to extract the most benefits from the surroundings in order to survive. All are friends around me. I've looked through all the dark sides of their personalities and yet I have to pretend that I know nothing. THEY ARE GOOD. THEY ARE GOOD. AND WE ARE FRIENDS. And then I can make myself comfortable enough to talk to people I hate the most. And of course, they don't say any words truly from their hearts. Neither do I. But, sometimes I just feel unwilling to talk to these people. Sometimes, I just want to be alone, quietly, without being forced to listen to their gossip or other useless words.

Planning and goal setting are part of career building, but so is adjusting and taking advantage of things that happen in an unplanned way. Our dreams and desires, as well as the opportunities open to us, are changing all the time. Sometimes, they can change dramatically over a short period of time. Dealing with change often requires taking your career in a different direction. Therefore, most people's career paths wind up looking more like a forest path or the course of a river than a straight flight path from point A to Point B. Career paths tend to _ . Just as a river must take an indirect path to get round hills and other obstacles , we often have to do a little meandering to get round barries. We also meander simply to explore various career posibilities. This doesn't mean that you should wander aimlessly for the rest of your life! It doesn't mean that, although career building gives you an overall sense of direction, it is responsible to expect that you'll have to take some meandering along the way. Career building involves maneuvering as well as meandering. To maneuver is to be focused and strategic , to decide what you want and how you are going to get there. Believe it or not, you can maneuver and meander at the same time. In fact, you have probably already done so. For example, if you have ever sent in an application form for an education program or job before you are really sure you want your application to be accepted, you have taken action on a plan while you are still exploring other posibilities.

"Question: What is the purpose of this text? Context: One in ten teens says they use""study drugs""to improve their performance in school. So-called ""study drugs""refer to prescription medicines that are used to treat ADHD .But most parents have no understanding of the problem, a new study finds. In January, 2013, researchers from the University of Michigan Mott Children's Hospital did a national survey of more than seven hundred families with teens. They found that only one percent of parents believe their child has taken a study drug. Yet in a 2012 University of Michigan study, ten percent of second-year high school students and twelve percent of third-year high school students say they use a study drug. The misuse of study drugs didn't come to the attention of almost all parents.""What we found in this survey is a clear mismatch ,""said Dr. Matthew Davis, one of the researchers. It is a mismatch between what parents believed and what their kids were reporting. ""We know teens are spreading the word that these drugs can improve their grades,""Davis said.""But these prescription medicines are drugs. And teens who use them without a prescription are taking a serious risk."" The new survey showed that fifty-four percent of white parents were""very concerned""about their child taking study drugs, compared with thirty-eight percent of Hispanic parents and thirty-seven percent of black parents. However, just twenty-seven percent of parents surveyed have talked to their teens about using study drugs. Of these parents, forty-one percent were black, twenty-seven percent were white and seventeen percent were Hispanic. Students with a prescription for an ADHD drug should be required to keep their medicines in a safe place, such as the school nurse's office.

Unfortunately,hippos can't sing,either.All that came from his mouth were terrible noises,and when the other animals heard this,they all came around to make fun of the hippo. He was so ashamed by this.He also felt bad about having knocked the tree over.He used all his strength to raise the tree back up again,and look after it until it completely recovered. . </s>	corrected his mistake when he realized it </s>
"Question: Why did the author follow the old man and the girl? Context: Today, I felt terrible. My head was full of problems, burdens and confusion. I decided to take a walk even though I didn't know where I would go. The most extraordinary thing happened when I was on this walk. I saw an old man sitting on a chair. He was a seller of second-hand shoes. I thought he looked at least seventy years old. He seemed so tired and nobody was buying his shoes. I wanted to give him something but I had not brought anything with me. Then, a little girl came toward him. I heard the child say, ""Grandfather, may I polish your shoes?"" That old man took pity on her and he gave her a shoe to polish. The girl said, ""I polish the shoe because I need money to buy my brother a new school uniform."" I heard this and tears came to my eyes. The old man answered, ""Oh, little girl. Just stop doing this. Come with me and I will buy you a school uniform."" Then they walked to a market and I followed them behind. There he bought her a school uniform. The girl said, ""Thank you so much for doing this. May God bless you."" Then she left, leaving the old man smiling. He walked away from the market, but I stopped him. I whispered in his ear, ""You are a hero! Thank you for your kindness!"" As I walked away, I glanced back and I could see him still smiling. My own sadness disappeared and was chased away by the light of this kind act. I began realizing that I have a lot to be thankful for. I hope, some day, I can show my appreciation of what I have by following the example of the old man who only had a little, but shared it beautifully with someone who had nothing. </s>"	To witness a kind act. </s>

The talk was about the love of their great country. All the little ones were sitting in a large meeting-room. The old officer went up and began speaking. He said , "" Boys and girls . I studied in this school forty years ago. When I was your age, we were not as happy as you are today. Think about it and answer me, why are you so happy now?"" No sound came from the children. The old man waited for a long time. Then a short boy in the front put up his small dirty hand. ""Good boy! Please answer me, dear."" said the officer.

"Question: In Para. 5, the author emphasized the importance of _ . Context: How to improve our life? Many people think that they have to accept whatever life throws at them. They'll say, ""This is my destiny .I cannot change it."" Of course not! You don't have to suffer needlessly. Your life depends on you, not on any other external factor. I know a woman who says she just accepts what life gives her because she has done everything she can to improve it. Guess what her lifestyle is? She wakes up in the morning, goes to work, comes back home, relaxes, chats with people, watches TV, and then goes to sleep. Next day, the same routine cycle follows. Huh! Is this what she calls ""doing her best""? She believes she has tried her best and just accepts it in her heart that this is the life that has been intended for her and that her luck can only change if God wills it. She hasn't realized that we have to do our share of making the effort to live the life of our dreams. Remember that you harvest what you sow. You have to get off the sofa, get your eyes off the TV screen, get your hands off the phone(unless it contributes to your success),and get your mind and body to work! Don't expect your luck to change, unless you do something about it. If something goes wrong, don't just regard it as a temporary setback; instead, learn your lesson, make the most of the situation, and do something to solve the problem. It's not enough to think positively; you also have to act positively. If someone's life is in trouble, do you just hope and pray that things will turn out fine? Of course not! You get to do anything you can to save the person. So it is with your own life. It is not enough to hope for the best, but you have to do your best. In other words, don't just stand(or sit)there, do something to improve your life. </s>"	positive action </s>
"Question: What's the writer's attitude towards kids pooling? Context: Sharing cars to work is not unusual.But what about sharing time to raise children together? In Ningbo city of Zhejiang province in East China, young mothers in the same neighborhood pool their children together, and share the responsibility of being parents. Spending every day together, but not families - in this coastal city of East China, three mothers are trying a new way of raising their kids, by pooling them together. Among the mothers are both office workers and housewives.They say they do so not just because of the tight schedule. Jiujiu's mother said, ""By kids pooling, we mean to create an opportunity for the kids to spend time together so that we can observe our kids, learn more about them.And then we can discuss how to better bring them up."" The three families have been doing so for two years, in school days and holidays.Their children have grown used to each other's company, Chichi's mother said, ""My son was a bit shy.We've been talking him to be more active, but he hardly changed.After joining the kids pool, suddenly we found him willing to communicate with others now.When we are not there, he has to rely on himself to get along with his pals."" Generally, mothers speak highly about the pooling.The mothers describe the pooling as bringing the running water into a closed pond.It opens a window to a different world for both kids and parents.But there are moments when opinions differ.Xiaoxiao's mother said, ""Sex education for example.Kids will be curious about it when they reach a certain age.Personally I want to talk with my child about it, frankly and sincerely.But the other two moms think it better not to bring it up."" Xiaoxiao's mother says her solution is to share some parenting guidebooks with other mothers and let them make the decision. The headmaster of the kindergarten believes such pooling activities test not only children, but also the parents.Jin Hongqing, kindergarten headmaster said, ""Parents need to be tolerant and patient.They shouldn't play the blame game when kids fight with each other.It's better to let the kids solve the issue by themselves.What they can do as parents is to communicate."" </s>"	Unclear. </s>
"Question: The only thing the writer knew that she _ . Context: I was twenty years old, and my parents were looking forward to the day when I would be earning my own living. Unfortunately, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted my future occupation to be. The only thing I did know was that I did not want to spend the next 45 years teaching, being a nurse or sitting in an office. But that was before the postman delivered a catalogue of courses that were being offered at the local college. As I looked through it, I was attracted by a page that talked about the difficulties faced by deaf people in their everyday lives and how students could help by learning sign language. It went on to say that graduates of the course usually find work in different organizations, such as law companies, the Stock Exchange, insurance companies and banks. Then I saw something that really caught my eye: ""Singer"" are also needed for sporting events, concerts, theatrical performances and, believe it or not, circuses! By the time I got to the bottom of the page, I knew I had found the perfect occupation. I enrolled on the course, which to my parents' great delight was free of charge. The course was brilliant. My favourite part was the final lesson, when our teacher asked us to sign our favourite song. It was really difficult because not only did we have to sign the words, but we also had to find a way of showing whether the song was happy or sad and whether the beat was slow or fast. It was the hardest thing I have ever done--but also the most rewarding. </s>"	had never liked being in a teacher's office </s>
"Question: Accordingto Sadia Vanjara, the pain is from _ ? Context: Most children have heard their parents at one time or another yell ""sit up straight!"" or ""don't slouch!"" In the past, this was usually heard at the dinner table as children ate dinner. But these days, it is also heard around another activity-video games. Ten-year old Owaish Batliwala, from Mumbai, India, admits he spends three to four hours each day playing games on his tablet computer. His mother Mehzabin became concerned when her son started saying that his neck hurt. She said, ""My son started having neck problems around June or July. The pain slowly spread to his hand and his back. He plays for hours on the iPad and mobile phone. This is what has caused the problem."" Sadia Vanjara is a physical therapist. She says the number of young children with chronic pain in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the rise. Dr. Vanjara says the pain is not from aging, accidents or disease. It is from poor posture, or body position, while playing video games. ""They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, their age is like, under 10, they are not complaining, the blood reports are fine, their x-rays are fine, their MRI's are fine, then where is the culprit ? And that is the very common thing that is happening amongst all children and that is smart phones and the gadgets ."" This is a problem in many parts of the world. But there are more smartphone users in India than anywhere else in the world, except China. Networking equipment company Cisco estimates that the number of smartphone users in India will increase from 140 million today to 651 million by 2020. 19-year old student Nida Jameel says she feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smartphone most of the day. She says she uses her smartphone 24/7. This means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time. ""As I use phone 24/7 (all day) like, so probably yeah, it was because of the phone, continuous usage and Snapchat, Whatsapp, more and more you know social media coming, so like phone is the center of everything."" Dr. Vanjara says the best treatments for the pain are daily exercises. ""And start stretching it in all the possible directions that you can."" Correct posture can help prevent pain. Dr. Vanjara teaches children how to hold their gadgets correctly. She tells a patient to hold the gadget in front of the face. She says that bending the head down to look at the device, strains the neck and creates an unhealthy bend to the back. Sadia Vanjara predicts we will see not only physical but psychological and emotional problems resulting from overuse of gadgets. Experts advise taking breaks from using a computer or other device often. Stand up. Stretch your legs, back, shoulders and arms. And when your work or school work is done, unplug and exercise. </s>"	poor posture </s>
"Question: We can learn from the passage that _ . Context: In 1989 an 8.2 earthquake almost flattened America, killing over 30,000 people in less than four minutes. A father rushed to the school where his son was supposed to be, only to discover that the building was as flat as a pancake. After the shock, he remembered the promise he had made to his son: ""No matter what happened, I'll always be there for you!"" And tears began to fill his eyes. As he looked at the pile of ruins that once was the school, it looked hopeless, but he kept remembering his promise to his son. Remembering his son's classroom would be in the back right corner of the building, he rushed there and started digging. Other parents tried to pull him off the ruins, saying: ""It's too late! _ 're all dead! You can't help!"" He replied, ""Are you going to help me now?""

Question: The writer thinks it _ for people to feel unhappy in time of difficulty. Context: If practicing an attitude of gratitude during the storms of life is too much for you right now, that's OK. When things are tough, most people have a hard time being thankful. They're so caught up in what's wrong in the present moment that they simply can't see some things are still right. If that's true for you, then accept it. You're going through a particularly difficult or unhappy period of time, and you don't like it one bit. Very normal, very human. But remember this: there is always something to be grateful for. It maybe only a small comfort right now, but it is a start. Make a list of some of the terrible things that didn't happen. For example: *You're in debt...but you're not homeless. *You lost your job...but you didn't lose your health. *You broke your leg...but you didn't break your neck. *Your mother has Alzheimer's disease...but your father doesn't. No matter how bad things are, they could always be worse. Start finding gratitude for what might have happened, but didn't. It does help a lot. Of course, you may not be thankful for everything-- but you can always be thankful for something. </s>	understandable </s>
"Question: What do we know about Samake and her family? Context: ""To educate a girl is to educate a thousand people,"" says Maimouna Samake, a mother of six children(including five girls). ""If you put one seed in the ground and rain comes, it will grow to produce many seeds."" Samake, one of 2,000 residents, lives in a small village, Sounkala, in one of the world's poorest countries. Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help. Samake hasn't been to school, but she wants a better future for her five daughters, including Ramatou, 12, and Mariam, 10. ""When a woman attends school, she will teach what she learns to her children,"" said Ramatou, who wants to become a doctor. ""She will also know how to take better care of her family."" Build On tries to build schools for grades one to three. If things go well over those three years, they return to help build another school for grades four to six, and then set up evening adult literacy classes. Ramatou and Mariam will not learn inside the walls of build On school since they are already in the sixth grade, but Samake hopes that they will be able to attend evening classes to continue learning. </s>"	Mariam is in the sixth grade. </s>

"Question: Which word can be used to describe my true feeling at the scene of the hunting? Context: When I was two years old, something happened which I have never forgotten. It was early spring, and there was a light mist over the trees and fields. The other young fellows and I were feeding at the lower end of the field when we heard the distant cry of dogs. The oldest among us lifted his head to listen. ""There are the hounds "", he said, and immediately raced off. The rest of us followed him to the top of the field where we could see several fields beyond. Soon the dogs were all racing down the field next to ours, making a loud ""yoyoyoyo"" sound. After then came men on horses, some in green coats. Suddenly, the dogs became silent and ran around with their noses to the ground. ""They've lost the smell of the hare."" said the old horse. ""Perhaps it will escape."" But the dogs began their ""yoyoyoyo"" again and came at full speed towards our field. Just then a hare, wild with fear, ran towards the trees. The dogs jumped over the stream and ran across the field, followed by the huntsmen. Six or eight jumped their horses over the stream, close behind the dogs. Before the hare could get away, the dogs were upon her with wild cries. We heard a terrible scream, and that was the end of the hare. One of the men picked her up and held her by the leg. She was covered in blood, but all the huntsmen seemed pleased. I was so greatly surprised that at first I did not see what was happening by the stream but when I did look, I saw a sad sight. Two fine horses were down, one in the stream struggling to stand up and the other on the grass with one of his legs broken. One rider, who seemed unhurt, was climbing out of the water, but the other lay quite still. ""His neck is broken,"" said my mother. ""I can't understand why men are so fond of this sport. They often hurt themselves and ruin good horses, all for one hare that they could get more easily in other ways. But we are only horses, and don't know why men do these things."" They carried the dead rider to our master's house, and then came back to the black horse on the grass. The animal was in great pain and one of his legs was broken. Someone ran to our master's house and came back to the horse with a gun. Soon after there was a loud bang and a terrible cry, and the black horse did not move any more. </s>"	Sad. </s>

Question: According to the passage ,the best way for children to learn things is by _ Context: Let children learn to judge their own work. A child learning to talk does not learn by being corrected all the time :if corrected too much, he will stop talking. He notices a thousand times a day the difference between the language he uses and the language those Around him use. Bit by bit .he makes the necessary changes to make his language like other people's. In the same way, children learn to do all the other things: they should learn to do without being taught, such as to walk, run, climb, whistle, ride a bicycle--compare their own performances with those of more skilled people, and slowly make the needed changes. But in school we never give a child a chance to find out his mistakes and correct them for himself. We do it all for him. We act as if we thought that he would never notice a mistake unless it was pointed out to him, or correct it unless he was made to .Let him work out, with the help of other children if he wants it, what this word says, what the answer is to that problem, whether this is a good way of saying or doing this or not. If it is a matter of right answer, as it may be in mathematics or science, give him the answer book. Let him correct his own papers. Why should we teachers waste time on such routine work? Our job should be to help the child when he tells us that he can't find the way to get the right answer .Let the children learn what all educated persons must some day learn ,how to measure their own understanding, how to know what they know or do not know. </s>	doing what other people do </s>

"Question: How many examples does the author offer to describe the future life? Context: When a magazine for high school students asked its readers what life would be like in twenty years, they said: Machines would be run by solar power. Buildings would rotate so they could follow the sun to take maximum advantage of its light and heat. Walls would ""give light"" and ""change color with the push of a button."" Food would be replaced by pills. School would be taught by electrical impulse while we sleep. Cars would have radar . Does this sound like the year 2000? Actually, this article was written in 1958 and the question was, ""what will life be like in 1978? The future is much too important to simply guess about, the way the high school students did, so experts are regularly asked to predict accuately. By carefully studying the present, skilled businessmen, scientists, and politicians are supposedly able to figure out in advance what will happen. But can they? One expert on Cities wrote: Cities of the future would not be crowded, but would have space for farms and fields. People would travel to work in ""airbuses"", large all-weather helicopters carrying up to 200 passengers. When a person left the airbus station he could drive a coin-operated car equipped with radar. The radar equipment of cars would make traffic accidents ""almost unheard of"". Does that sound familiar? If the expert had been accurate it would, because he was writing in 1957. His subject was ""The city of 1982"". If the professionals sometimes sound like high school students, it's probably because future study is still a new field. But economic forecasting, or predicting what the economy will do, has been around for a long time. It should be accuate, and generally it is. But there have been some big mistakes in the field, too. In early 1929, most forecasters saw an excellent future for the stock market. In October of that year, the stock market had its worst losses ever, ruining thousands of investors who had put their faith in financial foreseers. One forecaster knew that predictions about the future would always be subject to significant error. In 1957, H.J.

Question: Which of the following is TRUE? Context: The most famous statue-the Sphinx in Egypt has been damaged. The experts are trying to find out the cause to protect it. As we all know, the Sphinx has the body of a lion and the face of a man. It was cut from limestone near Egypt's pyramids about 4, 500 years ago. Not long ago a large piece of stone fell from the Sphinx's right shoulder. In order to protect the statue from more harm, a computer was placed on it to measure rainfall, wind speed and air temperature. The computer also measured the amount of water and air pollution, the direction of wind and the temperature of the statue itself. The effects of age, wind, water and pollution have greatly weakened the Sphinx. Sunlight, wind, water and pollution have been eroding the outside of the statue for centuries. The experts hope that the information from the computer will help protect it from more damage. They say the more they know about what is destroying the Sphinx, the more they can do to protect it. </s>	The Sphinx is made of a kind of rock, which can be destroyed by wind, rain and so on. </s>

The outside rim which is right under the skin is most nutritious.But this part is often thrown away with the skin. Even the skin itself is better for food than the inside.

"Question: We learn from the passage that animal clones are likely to have _ . Context: Scientist Says 'No' to Human Cloning ""I've never met a human worth cloning,"" says cloning expert Mark Westhusin from his lab at Texas A&M University. ""It's a stupid endeavor."" That's an interesting choice of adjective, coming from a man who has spent millions of dollars trying to clone a 13-year-old dog named Missy. So far, he and his team have not succeeded, though they have cloned two cows and a cat. They just might succeed in cloning Missy soon -- or perhaps not for another five years. Westhusin's experience with cloning animals leaves him upset by all this talk of human cloning. In three years of work on the Missy project, using hundreds upon hundreds of dog's eggs, the A&M team has produced only a dozen or so embryos carrying Missy's DNA. None have survived the transfer to a surrogate mother. The wastage of eggs and the many spontaneously aborted(,) fetuses may be acceptable when you're dealing with cats or bulls, he argues, but not with humans. ""Cloning is incredibly inefficient, and also dangerous,"" he says. Even so, dog cloning is a commercial opportunity, with a nice research payoff. Ever since Dolly the sheep was cloned in 1997, Westhusin's phone has been ringing with people calling in hopes of duplicating their cats and dogs, cattle and horses. ""A lot of people want to clone pets, especially if the price is right,"" says Westhusin. Cost is no obstacle for Missy's mysterious billionaire owner; he's put up $3.7 million so far to fund A&M's research. Contrary to some media reports, Missy is not dead. The owner wants a twin to carry on Missy's fine qualities after she does die. The prototype(;)is, by all accounts, athletic, good-natured and supersmart. Missy's master does not expect an exact copy of her. He knows her clone may not have her temperament(, ). In a statement of purpose, Missy's owner and the A&M team say they are ""both looking forward to studying the ways that her clones differ from Missy."" Besides cloning a great dog, the project may contribute insight into the old question of nature vs. nurture. It could also lead to the cloning of special rescue dogs and many endangered animals. However, Westhusin is cautious about his work. He knows that even if he gets a dog pregnant, the offspring, should they survive, will face the problems shown at birth by other cloned animals: abnormalities like immature lungs and heart and weight problems~ ""Why would you ever want to clone humans,"" Westhusin asks, ""when we're not even close to getting it worked out in animals yet?"" </s>"	defective(, )organs </s>
"Question: Louis Braille developed an alphabet for blind people after he _ . Context: Louis Braille, Alphabet Maker Blind people can read. They do so by running their fingers along a line of raised points or dots on paper. Of course, they first have to learn the code. Here are some examples of it. One dot stands for the letter ""A."" Two dots side by side mean ""C."" Four dots arranged to look like a box (: :) stand for the letter ""G."" By placing the dots in special patterns, all the letters of the alphabet can be formed. This code was made up by a Frenchman called Louis Braille. Though he could see at birth, he became sightless when he was only three. Braille was cutting leather in his father's shop. His knife slipped and cut his eye. Infection spread to both eyes, and he became blind. At 10, he was placed in a home for the blind. But young Louis had great talent. He became a skilled musician and soon got a job as a church organist in Paris. Because he had talent and was quick, he became a teacher at a school for the blind. While there, he heard that an army captain had sent messages to his gun crews so they could read them at night without light. His messages were in the simple form of raised dots and dashes. This was the clue Louis needed. At the age of 15, he worked out his own six-dot code. Each group of dots is called a cell. The cells are three dots high and two dots wide. For the rest of his life, Braille taught his young flock to read both written and musical works using his code. For the last 17 years of his life, Braille was ill with tuberculosis . He died at the age of 43. France honored him by placing his remains in the famous Pantheon in Paris. </s>"	learned that soldiers could read messages from raised dots. </s>

"Question: Columbus' journals told us that in Bermuda _ . Context: We like to consider ourselves the superior race, and we are. It's true that we are getting to know more and more, and we actually live in ""the information age"". Our human vanity makes us believe that we really have to know everything! Surprisingly, we do not have this ability. The question ""what is happening in the Bermuda Triangle"" is the very proof. Where is the Bermuda Triangle located? The mysterious triangle is believed to be situated between Florida, Bermuda and Puerto Rico, where too many unusual events have happened. On December the 5th1945, five U.S. military planes took off from Florida on a clear day only to disappear over Bermuda. Furthermore, some other disappearances took place; in 1947, an American C54 plane simply disappeared at 100 miles from Bermuda; at 80 miles, a Star Tiger plane disappeared in 1948. Even Columbus had trouble in Bermuda. Some of his journals were about the strange happenings there: ""the waters are changing their colors"" and ""compasses are going wild"". Maybe it's why it is called the Devil's triangle or the Atlantic cemetery. Many _ were stated in order to explain the strange events. In spite of these attempts, the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle remains unsolved. Some people get to say that maybe aliens are involved in it. Other imaginative scientists relate the happenings in Bermuda to Einstein's theory, saying that the missing ships and planes are translated to another dimension of space and time and taken into another world. Maybe we will just have to wait to go to Heaven and ask the One who made it. The answer will surely be a satisfying one! </s>"	there were some strange happenings </s>
