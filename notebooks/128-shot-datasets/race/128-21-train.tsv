The passenger who had called him back wanted	"Six people were traveling in a compartment on a train. Five of them were quiet and well behaved , but the sixth was a rude young man who was causing a lot of trouble to the other passengers. At last this young man got out of the station with his two heavy bags. None of the other passengers helped him, but one of them waited until the rude young man was very far away, and then opened the window to him, "" You left something behind in the compartment!"" Then he closed the window again. The young man turned around and hurried back with his two bags. He was very tired when he arrived, but he shouted through the window, "" What did I leave behind?"" As the train began to move again, the passenger who had called him back opened the window and said, "" A very bad impression!"""	['to punish him for his bad behavior']
Which of the following is NOT true about the newly found ring?	"Astronomers recently found another ring around the planet Saturn -- and it's the biggest one yet. This newly discovered ring stretches about 15 million miles across, which makes a loop big enough to fit a billion Earths inside. It may be even bigger and reach 22 million miles across at its diameter . Saturn's new ring is now the biggest known ring in the solar system. This ring, like Saturn's other rings, is not one solid piece of rock. Instead, it is made up of millions or billions of tiny rocks that orbit the planet all together and give the appearance of a unified ring. Unlike the more visible rings, however, this big one is mysterious -- the pieces are far apart, and the ring cannot be seen from the surface of the Earth. If all the pieces were stuck together, they'd be slightly bigger than a rock a half-mile wide. Astronomers suspect that the newly discovered ring gets its material from Saturn's outermost moon, Phoebe. For example, the dust in the ring circles Saturn in the same path and the same direction as Phoebe. Plus, the surface of Phoebe is marked with holes and places where rock has been knocked away, the result of collisions between Phoebe and other moons and rocks. These collisions could have sent dust out into space to become part of the big ring. The discovery of the ring could help explain other mysteries surrounding Saturn and its dozens of moons. The moon called Iapetus, for example, is two-toned: one side is gray; the other more reddish. Iapetus is within the newly discovered ring, but it orbits in the opposite direction. As a result, some researchers say, debris from the ring may have coated and color1ed one side of Iapetus as it moved through space, and left the other side alone. ""The cause of Iapetus' strange color1 distribution ... has been a puzzle that now seems solved,"" said Joseph Burns, a scientist. But not everyone agrees. Some think the ring alone may not be able to explain Iapetus' funny color1ing."	['It can be seen from the Earth.']
Which of the following is true?	White bread is thought to have a long history.In ancient Egypt, people discovered white bread about 8,000 years ago. There is something interesting about white bread.In the old times,many cities in ancient Greece said they owned the best quality.In the middle ages,bakers in England carefully _ their secrets of making bread.Anyone who hoped to learn the art of making bread must spend seven years on it.In times of war and disasters ,bread and wheat were the first things to bekept closely. However,in the mid-1800s,an engineer from Switzerland invented a new kind mill to produce more white bread at a faster speed.Soon bread making became widely popular all over Europe.In 1928,America had the first company to produce and sell mountains of white bread.

We learn that compared to Americans, Australians _ .	"Once upon a time, there was a scholar who wanted to gain more knowledge each day even though he had already gained enough knowledge. One day, he came to visit a saint and wanted to be his student. The saint provided some tea. He slowly filled the scholar's cup: the cup was full, yet he kept pouring and pouring. The scholar burst out, ""Stop! You can't add anything to something that's already full!"" The saint set down the teapot and replied, ""Exactly."" Whether it's the silence between notes in music, or some open time in your schedule, you need space to act effectively. Yet most of us, myself included, tend to stuff as much as possible into whatever room is available-closets, schedules, budgets, relationships, and even the mind itself. However, some people know how to avoid overstuffing their life. For example, in Australia, it seemed that most people there operated at about 85% of their capacity ,unlike Americans pushing as close to 100% as possible. So when you run into Australians you know in the street, they have time to hang out and talk with you. Remember the cup: its value is in the space, the emptiness it holds. How to empty your ""cup""? Be mindful of the element of space, openness , and emptiness in your life. This includes room in a drawer, the volume of air in a kitchen, and open-mindedness in a friend. Sometimes you're just stuck with a big bucket of tasks yet to do. But at least empty the bucket faster than you fill it with new tasks. Put some space between finishing one thing and staring another. For example, after sending one email, take a breath before replying to another one. Drop the stuff you can no longer afford to _ around. At sea level, you can run with a brick in your backpack, but if you're hiking on a mountain, that brick has got to go."	['spare more time for themselves']
The novel Unstoppable intends to inspire kids that _ .	"Former National Football League player and children's author Tim Green has added another book to his list of accomplishments: Unstoppable. The book tells the story of a 12-year -old boy named Harrison, who survives life in a cruel foster home before he finally finds a loving family. Once he settles in and realizes his natural football ability, tragedy strikes again and he loses his leg to a deadly bone cancer. Unstoppable follows Harrison's incredible journey as he faces many challenges in his life. Tim Green says he decided to write a novel about a kid facing cancer after watching how his wife fought to survive her own illness. ""Her mental and physical toughness were more heroic to me than anything I'd ever seen in the national sports leagues,"" Green told TFK Kid Reporter Zachary J. Lewis. After watching his wife's battle, Green said, he knew he needed to write about a person who struggled through a serious illness. But because the target age for his books is teen, he needed to tell the story through the eyes of someone that age. When friends introduced Green to Jeffrey Keith, Green knew he had found the right person to help him"" capture the heroism that it takes to fight cancer"". Cancer-survivor Jeffrey Keith lost his leg to disease at age twelve, but went on to be the goalie for the Boston College Division 1 Lacrosse Team and was also the first _ to run 3,300 miles across the country. When Green heard Jeffrey Keith's story, he knew it was the perfect narrative on which to base his next book. TFK asked Keith what it felt like to read Unstoppable for the first time. ""Tim captured what it felt like for me to go through this experience and battle back,"" Keith said. ""After I read the book, Tim asked me to describe it in one word, and I said 'awesome'. Tim's work sends a message to all the kids across the country that are facing obstacles that can have nothing to do with cancer: you are all unstoppable, as long as you believe it."""

When a person is badly hurt and is unconscious, he _ .	Suppose a man has a car accident. He is hurt badly and is _ , that is, he can't think, speak, or hear. His family takes him to the hospital. The doctors tell the family that his brain is dead. A machine can make him breathe . Now the patient's family must answer some difficult questions. Should they think he is dead? Should they ask the doctors to use the machine to make him breathe? Sometimes machines can make an unconscious person breathe for years. However if his brain is dead , he will never think, speak, or hear again. Then, should his family ask the doctors not to use the machine and let him die? Someone who is unconscious can't say he wants to die. Can his family say this for him? Some people think this is a good idea. Some think otherwise. Many people are hurt when machines keep a person alive. The unconscious person doesn't know it. Machines only make the family and friends hurt longer.	"[""doesn't feel pain""]"
What can be a suitable title for the text?	If you need to spend time on the road,it's important to find ways to keep safe on your feet. Don't suppose it's your right of way. Yes, you might be crossing at the right place, at the right time, within the crosswalk area, but you are still exposed to danger. It could be a distracted driver, or a cyclist with a loose sense of traffic rules, so you could still get hurt. You can be in the right legally, but that won't be much help when you're in the hospital. Follow pedestrian signals. Just as drivers aren't supposed to speed up to beat a light when crossing through an intersection, pedestrians need to take the same care when obeying their own signals. If the hand is flashing and the countdown is into single digits ,stay where you are. Trying to outrun the flashing hand is unsafe,especially as cars try to clear the intersection before the light turns red. Give drivers enough time to stop when crossing. Don't suppose that drivers will jam on their brakes when you hit the crosswalk signals. Some provinces, such as Alberta, issue a ticket if you don't give drivers enough time to brake. Cross quickly. Once you've followed all of the other rules, and it is safe to cross the street, don't then just wander along in front of six lanes of traffic. There's no need to run or jog, but respect the drivers who respected you enough to stop for you.	['Tips to Keep Safe on Your Feet']
According to the writer of the letter, college is a time _ .	"Dear XXX, As we drove off from Columbia, I wanted to write a letter to you to tell you all that is on my mind. First, I want to tell you how proud we are. You have become a talented and accomplished young woman. You should be as proud of yourself as we are. College will be the most important years in your life. It is in college that you will truly discover what learning is about. You often question ""what good is this course"". I encourage you to be inquisitive , but I also want to tell you: ""Education is what you have left after all that is taught is forgotten."" What I mean by that is -- the material taught isn't as important as you gaining the ability to learn a new subject, and the ability to analyze a new problem. Do your best in classes, but don't let pressure get to you. If you graduate and learn something in your four years, we would feel happy. Your Columbia degree will take you far, even if you don't graduate with honors. So please don't give yourself pressure. The only thing that matters is that you learned. The only measurement you should use is that you tried. Most importantly, make friends and be happy. College friends are often the best in life, because during college you are closer to them physically than to your family. Also, going through independence and adulthood is a natural bonding experience. Pick a few friends and become really close to them -- pick the ones who are genuine and sincere to you. Don't worry about their hobbies, grades, looks, or even personalities. If you think you like someone, tell her. You have very little to lose. People are not perfect, so as long as they are genuine and sincere, trust them and be good to them. They will give back. This is my secret of success -- that I am genuine with people and trust them (unless they do something to lose my trust). College is the four years where you have: *the greatest amount of free time *the first chance to be independentk%s5$u *the most flexibility to change *the lowest risk for making mistakes So please treasure your college years - make the best of your free time, become an independent thinker in control of your destiny. May Columbia become the happiest four years in your life, and may you blossom into just what you dream to be. Love, XXX"	['during which one needs to learn to be independent']
According to the passage, students who date in middle school may _	"Students who date in middle school have significantly worse study skills. They are four times more likely to drop out of school and report twice as much alcohol and tobacco use as their single classmates, according to new research from the University of Georgia. ""Romantic relationships are a trademark of adolescence, but very few studies have examined how adolescents differ in the development of these relationships,"" said Pamela Orpinas, study author and professor in the College of Public Health and head of the Department of Health Promotion and Behavior.[: _ Z _ X _ X _ K] Orpinas followed a group of 624 students over a seven-year period from 6th to 12th grade. Each year, the group of students completed a survey indicating whether they had dated and reported the frequency of different behaviors, including the use of drugs and alcohol. Their teachers completed questionnaires about the students' academic efforts. He found some students never or hardly ever reported dating from middle to high school, and these students had consistently the best study skills according to their teachers. Other students dated infrequently in middle school but increased the frequency of dating in high school. ""At all points in time, teachers rated the students who reported the lowest frequency of dating as having the best study skills and the students with the highest dating as having the worst study skills,"" according to the journal article. Study skills refer to behaviors that lead to academic success such as doing work for extra credit being well organized, finishing homework, working hard and reading assigned chapters. ""Dating a classmate may have the same emotional complications of dating a co-worker,"" Orpinas said, ""When the couple break up, they have to continue to see each other in class and perhaps witness the ex-partner dating someone else. It is reasonable to think this could be linked to depression and divert attention from studying."" ""Dating should not be considered a ceremony of growth in middle school,"" Orpinas concluded."

A standard treatment for depression includes all the following ways EXCEPT _ .	"Researchers invited 79 people between the ages of 18 and 50 years old who had been diagnosed with depression. 33 of the participants were offered 20 music therapy sessions, in addition to their usual treatment for depression. The other 46 participants received stan dard treatment, and acted as the control group. The one-on-one music therapy sessions each lasted 60 minutes and took place twice a week. Trained music therapists helped each participant to improvise music. On average, each participant attended 18 music therapy sessions. 29 individuals (88 percent) attended at least 15 sessions. The participants in both groups were followed up at three and six months and assessed forsymptoms of depression and anxiety. In the final analysis, researchers discovered that af ter three months of participation, individuals who received music therapy showed greatly fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, and scored better on general functioning. Although improvements still remained after six months, the difference between the groups was no longer statistically significant. Co-researcher Christian Gold, Ph.D., explained the study findings: ""Our trial has shown that music therapy, when added to standard care including medication, psychotherapy and counseling , helps people to improve their levels of depression and anxiety. Music therapy has specific qualities that allow people to express themselves and interact in a non-verbal way - even when they cannot find the words to describe their inner experiences."" Given the success of the study, researchers say it needs to be repeated with a larger sample of people, and that further research is needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of such therapy. Outside experts believe this study shows that music ther apy is an effective addition to traditional therapy and improves outcomes. Mike Crawford, M.D., said, ""This is a high-quality randomized trial of music therapy specifically for depression, and the results suggest that it can improve the mood and general functioning of people with depression."""

What did people think of girls who got tattooed in the past?	Every girl wants to have a great-looking tattoo design that makes them more attractive. Small and lovely tattoo designs are the path to go for girls planning to get tattooed for the first time. Nowadays, more and more females are getting a tattoo inked on their body. In the last fifteen years, tattoos have grown from being a sign of rebelliousness and trouble to a state of popular acceptance as a mark of fashion. Tattoos are permanent so you need to be sure that you like it before getting one. A great way is to have small tattoos that look beautiful as well. You can get a cherry blossom tattoo on the foot, perhaps, a hibiscus flower on the shoulder or a lovely butterfly on the lower stomach; whatever design you choose, it can definitely add to your attractiveness and charm. Deciding to get a tattoo needs careful thought and reflection. Otherwise, you could make some serious tattoo mistakes. Try to avoid big and obvious designs if possible. Another important part of choosing a tattoo design is the location. What part of the body do you want it on? Choosing a hidden location can often make the tattoo the perfect adornment . As for professional women, tattoos should normally be where they can be hidden. Most importantly, no matter what tattoo design you choose the final goal is that the design should be something you like. If you are into the tattoo and really feel passionate about it you will carry yourself in a different manner when you get it inked on your body.	['They thought these girls were rebellious']
According to the passage,which part can help build up your confidence?	Tests can be stressful even for the most prepared students,and,unfortunately,test anxiety can actually have a negative impact on your performance.(Just having that knowledge adds to the stress,doesn't it?)Well,the following tips can help you get through your next test with much greater ease--and likely more success! Get Enough Sleep Getting 6 hours of less can put you into what's called a sleep deficit,or lack of sufficient sleep,which can actually make you less sharp mentally and thus negatively affect your performance on tests,even if you spent those missed hours of sleep studying.So it's very important for you to get all of your studying done so you can get a good night of sleep before your big day. Study Smarter Being organized with your studies can help you keep from pulling all-nighters to get all of your studying in and blowing the test because you're exhausted.How do you study 'smarter'? Make a list of the most important things you need to learn,in order of importance,and hit the items at the top of the list first.That way,if you run out of time,you're mostly covered.Make a list of all the work you have to do,estimate how much time each item will take,and compare that with the amount of hours you have available;this will tell you if you can carefully read or just skim,how many times you can afford to revise papers,and other ways to pace yourself so you can get everything done.If you're pressed for time,it's important to learn to let go of being perfect.Oh,and turn off the TV as much as possible until your tests are behind you. Visualize Success Before you fall asleep each night,it is a great way to visualize yourself taking the tests and doing wonderfully.Detailed visualizations can help you feel like you're really experiencing something,and visualizing yourself doing well is a way to 'practice' success in a way that can actually help you perform better and feel confident.Being confident as you take your exams can keep you from choking because of the stress.Visualizations can also help you to remember facts: you can create detailed scenarios that involve the information you're trying to remember,and this can help cement the facts in your memory. Stay Calm Because stress can impair your memory,it's important to stay calm before and during tests.While that's easier said than done,there are several stress relief techniques that can help you calm down quickly whenever you feel overwhelmed.For example,breathing exercise has been shown by research to reduce test anxiety,and can be extremely effective in helping you relax and reverse your stress response in a variety of situations: just take deep breaths,expanding your belly on the inhale,and let the stress come out with your exhales.

The driver wrote a short note and stuck it on the window because _ .	"A driver stopped his car on a street side to have a rest.As he lay down in the seat and closed his eyes, a person came up and knocked at the window to ask the time. The driver opened his eyes and looked at his watch. ""It's five past eight."" he said. Then he went to sleep again. But soon he was waken up again because a second person was knocking at the window.""Excuse me, what time is it now?""he asked. The driver looked at his watch again, and told him it was half past eight. In this way, the driver thought he couldn't have a good rest, so he wrote a short note and stuck it on the window for all to see. It said,""I don't know the time.""Again, he lay down in the seat for his sleep. A few minutes later,a third person came and began to knock at the window, ""Hey, sir.""he said, ""It's a quarter to nine."""	"[""he didn't want anybody to trouble him.""]"
New rules for pubs and clubs will be introduced in Britain to ban heavy drinking because _ .	"Tough new rules for pubs and clubs - including a ban on drinking games like the infamous ""dentist's chair"" - will be introduced in Britain this year in a bid to prevent the heavy drinking culture that costs the country billions of pounds a year. Other promotions like ""all you can drink for 10 pounds"", speed drinking competitions and ""women drink free"" nights will also be forbidden. But on the other hand, a large amount of offers of cheap alcohol in supermarkets - widely regarded as one of the main sources of Britain's problems with under-age and excessive drinking - will not be affected. Doctors and health experts argue that the government has failed to use its most effective weapon, the taxation of minimum price controls on alcohol. Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he did not want to target responsible drinkers on low incomes, but that the government and the industry had a duty to act on heavy drinking. ""These practices have a real impact on society, not to mention the lives of those who just want to enjoy a good night out."" he said. The ""dentist's chair"", where drinks are poured directly into the mouth by others, was made famous by the celebrations of footballer Paul Gascoigne. That game and others that promote mass consumption will be banned from April and publicans will have to ensure free tap water is made available to the drinkers. A second set of rules enforcing compulsory ID checks and making sure smaller alcoholic measures are on sale will come into effect in October. The government says excessive drinking costs Britain up to 12 billion pounds a year and has announced that any pubs that go against the new rule will face severe punishment. Publicans and vendors could lose their licenses, be fined up to 20,000 pounds or face six months in prison."	['drinking in the country costs too much']

What's the passage mainly about?	"Microsoft founder Bill Gates has talked about to be a good parent, saying that 13 is a right age for a child's first mobile phone. The 57-year-old father of three said on the Today show that his children Jennifer and Rory were not allowed phones until their thirteen birthday and his youngest daughter Phoebe is still waiting for one. ""We've made a rule in our family that it's 13 when you get a phone.""

It is said that their kids have to do housework at home after school and aren't given much pocket money. And in 2010Mr Gates said that he wanted to give most of his $61 billion away rather than hand it down. ""That wouldn't be good either for my kids or society,"" he said. Mr Gates left Microsoft in 2008 to put his heart to charity. During the Today interview with host Matt Lauer, he said that helping others made him feel happy as creating software. "" What you really feel is what you've achieved. If a piece of software gets out there and lots of people love it--it lets them get their work down in better ways--that's exciting."" he replied."

What is the author's attitude towards taking selfies according to the passage?	"The smart phones that can take self-portraits or selfies have set us free. We can now document every moment of our life and instantly share it with the world through the Internet. However, some believe that it's also causing people to take unnecessary risks that sometimes prove to be deadly! According to recent reports, the desire to take a breathtaking selfie has killed 12 people. Though that may not seem like a lot, it's 50% more than the death from shark attacks. While the issues have been known for a while, they came to a head on September 21st, following the accidental death of Hideto Ueda at the Taj Mahal. It turns out that the 66-year-old Japanese and his companion were trying to take a selfie with the Royal Gate as the background when they fell down some stairs. While the friend escaped with a broken leg, Ueda was not as fortunate. He suffered a head injury and died soon after. Other fatal accidents include a 21-year-old Russian woman who fell off a bridge while trying to capture an exciting self-portrait. Three Indian students suffered a similar fate after they were run over by a train while taking a selfie on the railway tracks. The rising number of injuries is forcing officials to take measures. Russia has begun a nationwide awareness program to make its young citizens aware of the dangers of this safe hobby. The campaign's slogan is:""Even a million 'likes' on social media are not worth your life and well-being."" Though no other country has followed their lead, many are banning the selfie stick! In the last few months many museums, and theme parks including Disney, have banned its use. JR West became the first institution worldwide to ban the sticks both inside Japan's bullet trains as well as out on the railway platforms. While these measures may help reduce the incidents, the only way to stop selfie-related injuries and deaths is to take responsibility -- not just for themselves but their friends. So next time you decide to take a selfie that appears a little risky, be sure to stop and ask yourself -- is it worth it?"	['Cautious.']
What's the writer's purpose of mentioning Denmark's literature?	"Hans Christian Andersen put Denmark on the map of the world literature with his stories The Emperor's New Clothes,The Little MermaidandThe Ugly Duckling. Now Copenhagen, the country's capital, has become the center of the world political map, with 190 world leaders attending the climate talks there, not to mention thousands of reporters. Just how much do you know about the Scandinavian country? Denmark is famous for its design culture. At the heart of ""Danish Design"" is the idea that, as poet and designer Piet Hein puts it: ""There is one art, not more, nor less, [and that is] to do all things with artlessness ."" Danish design places equal emphasis on practicality and quality. From Lego toys to furniture, Danish products are known for their clean lines, simplicity and functionality. ""Remove material where it's not needed. Keep things simple and functional and make them carefully,"" explained Hans J. Wegner, the first Danish designer to achieve worldwide fame: ""The aim is not to create a work of art, but to produce a good chair."" ""The Danes have done a better job than most in promoting arts in Europe, considering their country's size and population, in the fields of architecture, sculpture and design,"" writes Helena Smith, reporter with British newspaper the Guardian. The simplicity of Danish design may extend to the quality of life there. Some even claim that the Danes have the highest quality of life of any nation in the world. Kate Vial, a 55-year-old American who has lived and worked in Denmark for more than 30 years, explaining why she chooses to live in Denmark rather than the US, told Germany's biggest news weekly Der Spiegel: ""I just chose a simpler lifestyle, one where I could ride my bike all over and where I don't have to make a great living to survive."""

Why do officials worry that people in northern Nigeria may fear the vaccine once again?	A nurse prepares a polio vaccination for a baby in the Otash refugee camp in South Darfur. United Nations and Sudanese agencies will carry out the campaign this week and again in November. Sudan had been polio-free since two thousand and five. The new case of wild polio virus was _ last month in South Darfur. Health officials also announced last month that Nigeria has had almost seventy new cases of polio since two thousand and five. Those cases, however, were caused by the polio vaccine itself. There are two kinds of polio vaccine . The one given by injection contains killed virus, which cannot cause polio. The one given by mouth contains live but weakened virus. In very rare cases the virus can change and cause polio. The way to stop the spread now is more vaccinations. But officials worry that people in northern Nigeria may, once again, fear the vaccine. In recent years, local leaders spread stories that Western nations had poisoned the vaccine with the virus that causes AIDS. The United States Food and Drug Administration had told parents not to give them to children under age two unless a doctor says to use them. The F.D.A. gave the advice as it announced a meeting of experts to discuss cold medicines for children. That advisory committee met last week -- and voted that these drugs should not be given to children under the age of six. Members said there is not enough evidence to show that these drugs work in children. They called for more research. The committee also said that liquid medicines should all use the same measurement terms. This could reduce the risk of parents giving their children too much. _ The drug industry says its products are safe and effective for children. But it says parents need to be better educated about how to use them. A week before the meeting, the industry decided to end sales of cold products for children under two.

The best title of this passage might be_.	"How can you find out what is going on inside a person's body without opening the patient's body up? Regular X rays can show a lot. CAT scans can show even more. They can give a complete view of body organs. What is a CAT scan? CAT stands for a kind of machine. It is a special X-ray machine that gets a 360-degree picture of a small area of a patient's body. Doctors use X rays to study and determine diseases and injuries within the body, X rays can find a foreign object inside the body or take pictures of some inside organs to be X-rayed. A CAT scanner, however, uses a group of X rays to give a cross-sectional view of a specific part of the body. A fine group of X rays is scanned across the body and around the patient from many different directions. A computer studies the information from each direction and produces a clear cross-sectional picture on a screen. This picture is then photographed for later use. Several cross sections, taken one after another, can give clear ""photos"" of the entire body or of any body organs. The latest CAT scanners can even give clear pictures of active, moving organs, just as a fast-action camera can ""stop the action"", giving clear pictures of what appears unclear to the eye. And because of the 360-degree pictures, CAT scans show clear and complete views of organs in a manner that was once only shown during operation or examination of a dead patient. Frequent appearance before X rays can cause skin burns, cancer or other damage to the body. Yet CAT scans actually don't cause the patient to more radiation than regular X rays do. CAT scans can also be done without getting something harmful into the patient, so they are less risky than regular X rays. CAT scans provide exact, detailed information. They can quickly find such a thing as bleeding inside the brain. They are helping to save lives."	['New X-ray Machine to Save Lives']
I feel that apples taste a little sweeter than before because _ .	"One afternoon, my son came home from school and asked me, ""Are all people the same even if their skin color is different?"" I thought for a moment, then I said, ""I'll explain. Let's go to a fruit store first. I have something interesting to show you."" At the store, I told him that we needed to buy apples. And we bought some red apples, green apples and yellow apples. After we got home, I told Adam, ""It's time to answer your question."" I put one of each type of apple on the table: first a red apple, followed by a green apple and then a yellow apple. Then I looked at Adam, who was sitting on the other side of the table. ""Adam, people are just like apples. They come in different colors, shapes and sizes. See, some may not even look as delicious as others."" As I was talking, Adam was examining each one carefully. Then, I took each of the apples and peeled them, placing them back on the table, but in a different place. ""OK, Adam, tell me which one is the red apple, the green apple and the yellow apple."" He said, ""I can't tell. They all look the same now."" ""Take a bite of each one. See if that helps you tell which one is which."" He took big bites, and then a huge smile came across his face. ""People are just like apples! They are all different, but if you take off the outside, they're pretty much the same on the inside."" ""Right,"" I agreed. ""Just like everyone has their own features but they are nearly the same."" He completely got it. I didn't need to say or do anything else.

What can we infer from the text?	"By the mid-nineteenth century, the term ""icebox"" had entered the American language, but ice was still only beginning to affect the diet of ordinary citizens in the United States. The ice trade grew with the growth of cities. Ice was used in hotels, taverns , and hospitals, and by some forward-looking city dealers in fresh meat, fresh fish, and butter. After the Civil War (1861-1865), as ice was used to refrigerate freight cars, it also came into household use. Even before 1880, half of the ice sold in New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and one-third of that sold in Boston and Chicago, went to families for their own use. This had become possible because a new household convenience, the icebox, a precursor of the modern fridge, had been invented. Making an efficient icebox as not as easy as we might now suppose. In the early nineteenth century, the knowledge of the physics of heat, which was essential to a science of refrigeration, was rudimentary . The commonsense notion that the best icebox was one that prevented the ice from melting was of course mistaken, for it was the melting of the ice that performed the cooling. Nevertheless, early efforts to economize ice included wrapping up the ice in blankets, which kept the ice from doing its job. Not until near the end of the nineteenth century did inventors achieve the delicate balance of insulation and circulation needed for an efficient icebox. But as early as 1803, and ingenious Maryland farmer, Thomas Moore, had been on the right track. He owned a farm about twenty miles outside the city of Washington, for which the village of Georgetown was the market center. When he used an icebox of his own design to transport his butter to market, he found that customers would pass up the rapidly melting stuff in the tubs of his competitors to pay a premium price for his butter, still fresh and hard in neat, one-pound bricks. One advantage of his icebox, Moore explained, was that farmers would no longer have to travel to market at night in order to keep their produce cool."	['Knowledge of the physics of heat plays an important part in inventing a good icebox']
Which of the following prevents mums from achieving their goals?	"The struggle to ""have it all"" leaves many mothers giving up their health and hobbies. But dads have more time to spare according to a research, with just 55 per cent saying they lose sleep and regular exercise compared with 71 percent of mums. Twice as many mothers as fathers complained that they did not spend enough time relaxing, with almost half of mums spending less than two hours a week with friends. And more than a third miss out on hobbies and interests because they are too busy. In spite of changing roles in the family, women are still responsible for most of the child care. Nearly a third spend more than 10 hours a week caring for their children, compared with just one in ten fathers. More mums than dads also say housework and tiredness stop them achieving their goals. But the research also shows mums gain a sense of achievement from finishing the housework, getting their children to school on time or sitting down to a family dinner. The research underlines the fact that women feel under pressure to succeed in all areas of their lives. As Nick Booth, a marketing director put, ""They are pushing themselves too hard and are in danger of burning out. We'd encourage anyone to take time out for themselves. Having your own interests and hobbies and ensuring you get enough sleep is hugely important. Other parts of your life, including work and family life, improve as a result."" The Olympian and mother Jo Pavey admitted balancing career, family and personal time can be a struggle. Jo, 41, became the oldest female gold medalist at the European Championship last year - but regards her children as her biggest achievement. The mum of two said,""When I was younger,I'd have probably said it wasn't possible to have a sporting career and be mum. But actually it is all about striking a balance and looking after yourself."""

Mr. Henry thought that _ .	"One day, Anna was about to walk into her office, when the headmaster, Mr. Henry stopped her. ""Now,"" he said, ""I want you to tell me the truth, my dear."" ""Naturally,"" said Anna shortly, fearing that something terrible had happened. ""I have had a most serious accusation made against you by Mrs. Bond."" ""Mrs. Bond?"" said Anna, not understanding. Janet Bond was a quiet, little mouse of a child. As far as Anna could remember,she had never had cause to speak an angry word to the girl. ""Mrs. Bond,"" went on Mr. Henry, ""tells me that you scolded her daughter yesterday afternoon."" ""Scolded?"" cried Anna. ""I don't scold. At least not in school,"" she added honestly. ""Mrs. Bond's story is that Janet was a little late back to school in the afternoon. She said that the child had to spend some time in the bathroom, which meant she set out from home a little late."" ""Just a minute,"" said Anna, beginning to understand. ""She did come late, very late. I had marked her absent, of course. Then she wandered in, when we'd started our paper--cutting, and I believe I said she was a nuisance . She didn't appear to hear, and was certainly quite cheerful."" ""Ah, a nuisance."" Mr. Henry jumped on the word. ""You're sure you only said a nuisance."" ""I may not even have said that,"" Anna replied. ""It was no more than slight displeasure that I felt and I certainly didn't scold.""? ""Mrs. Bond said that you called her child a blasted nuisance. Is that true?"" ""Indeed it isn't,"" said Anna, ""The child or the mother has made it up!"" Mr. Henry was satisfied with Anna's explanation. ""Just as I thought, my dear, but of course I had to make sure."""

What's the writer's attitude towards digital footprint?	Every time you go online you leave a digital footprint. This is just like a real footprint. It tells where you have been, how long you stayed on line and what you have been doing there. It's easy to get the information and show your digital footprint every time when you send an email, messages and photos. You shouldn't worry about it too much but it is better to be careful about your digital footprint when you are online. There are five tips for taking care of your digital footprint. Don't forget to close the pages with your information when you leave a website, especially if you are using a shared computer. Don't tell anyone your password and don't write them down in a place that everybody can see. Make them more difficult by using both letters and numbers. Remember your favourite websites by looking over the history and the bookmark on your computer or your mobile phone. This is a way that your digital footprint can work in your favour, remember to clear your history from time to time. If you want to post some words on line, you don't have to use your own name. You can use a nickname instead. You can also use a picture instead of a real photo. Protect your personal information online. Be careful about who you share your own information with and always think twice before sharing email, home address, school or phone number with someone. All kinds of people are interested in your digital footprint. It's now quite common for people to look over some personal information online before they offer someone a job. There are cases of people having missed out on jobs and places because their digital footprint didn't make them look good. So remember: keep safe, don't put too much personal information online and always think carefully before you post something. Ask yourself, 'would I be happy for everyone to see this?'	['We should not use our own names online.']
The writer thinks that _ .	The use of the word imitation reminds me that we ought to make some more comments on the risk of people imitating what they see on the screen in the way of crime or violence. First there was always a risk of children acting out scenes which could be dangerous. For example, I remember a woman who was head of a middle school telling me that she had happened to look out of her window when the children were on the playground and had seen them putting a small boy on a chair with a rope round his neck and the rope over the branch of a tree; fortunately she was in time to get there before the child was hanged. I remember a film in particular in which the hero who was imprisoned had escaped by electrocuting his guard, the technique of doing this being shown in detail. This was the kind of scene which we could cut for these reasons. In films for young people and adults we always tried to keep off the screen the details of criminal techniques, such as how to open a locked door with a piece of hard plastic or how to open a safe; if we were consulted before production, I used to advise that the details should not be shown. When I gave talks in prisons about film checking I had full support for this, since fathers who were in prison for criminal offences did not want their children to get on crime. Every time I gave a talk in a prison someone used to mention the French film Rififi. made by Jules Dassin in 1954. This remarkable film showed in great detail a robbery of a jeweler's shop, the robbery lasting about half an hour and being backed by only natural sound...one of the most brilliant film sequences of all time. I remember our discussion at the time. We thought that the robbery was finished only with the use of advanced and obviously expensive equipment and that only the most experienced and skilled criminals could possibly imitate it; we believed therefore that it was ly safe. When talking in prisons some years later I learned that there had been several robberies in which the techniques had been copied, so perhaps we were wrong.

How did Yuuki save the villagers from the disaster?	"For hundreds of years, Japan has been hit, from time to time, by tsunamis , which are caused by earthquakes or underwater volcanoes. The story of the boy Yuuki is the story of such a disaster. Yuuki lived with his family in a seaside village, below a small mountain. One day, as he played on top of the mountain, Yuuki felt a small earthquake but it was not strong enough to frighten anybody. Soon after, however, Yuuki noticed the sea darken and begin running away from the shore very fast, leaving behind wide areas of beach that had never been seen before. Yuuki remembered reading that just before a terrible tsunami, the sea suddenly and quickly rolls backward. He ran to the beach, warning the villagers who had gathered to admire the new beach land. But no one listened. They laughed at him and continued playing in the new sand. Desperate, Yuuki could think of only one thing to do. He lit a tree branch, raced to the rice fields and began burning the harvested rice. Then he called out, ""Fire! Fire! Everyone run to the mountain! Now!"" When everyone reached the mountain top, a villager cried out, ""Yuuki is mad! I saw him set the fire."" Yuuki hung his head in shame, but said nothing as the villagers screamed at him. Just then, someone shouted, ""Look!"" In the distance a huge dark wave of water was speeding towards the shore. When it hit the shore, it destroyed everything. On the mountain everyone stared at the village ruins in terror. ""I'm sorry I burned the fields,"" said Yuuki, his voice trembling. ""Yuuki,"" the village chief answered. ""You saved us all."" The villagers cheered and raised Yuuki into the air. ""We were going to celebrate our rice harvest tonight,"" said one, ""but now we'll celebrate that we're all still alive!"""	['He set fire to the rice field.']
Before World War I, the tango spread to _ .	Argentina in the late nineteenth century was an exciting place. Around 1870,it was experiencing an economic boom, and the capital, Buenos Aires, attracted many people. Farmers, as well as a flood of foreigners from Spain and Italy, came to Buenos Aires seeking jobs. These jobs didn't pay well, and the people felt lonely and disappointed with their new life in the city. As the unhappy newcomers mixed together in the poor parts of the city, the dance known an the tango came into being. At the beginning the tango was a dance of the lower classes. It was danced in the bars and streets. At that time there many fewer women the men, so if a man didn't want to be left out, his only choice was to dance with another man so that he could attract the attention of the few available women. Gradually, the dance spread into the upper classes of Argentinean society and became more respectable. In Europe at this time, strong interest in dance from around the world was beginning. This interest in international dance was especially evident in Paris. Every kind of dance from ballet to belly dancing could be found on the stages of the Paris theaters of the Paris theaters. After tango dances from Argentina arrive in Europe, they began to draw the interest of the public as they performed their exciting dance in cafes. Though not everyone approved of the new dance, saying it was a little too shocking, the dance did find enough supporters to make it popular. The popularity of the tango continued to grow in many other parts of the world. Soldiers who returned to the United States from World War I brought the tango to North America. It reached Japan in 1926, and in 2003 the Argentinean embassy in Seoul hired a local tango dancer to act an a kind of dance ambassador, and promote tango dancing throughout South Korea.	['France.']
After the earthquake, all of the following occurred EXCEPT that _ .	"The City of Christchurch, New Zealand was struck by a 7.1magnitude earthquake on the early morning of Saturday, September 4, 2010. No tsunami alert was reported. The country's army troops were on standby to assist victims and disaster recovery operation. New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key, flew to the affected area to inspect and assess the situation of the damaged city. The Prime Minister said that the full assessment of the damages would possibly take months to know the severity of damages. Based from his assessment on what he saw in the area, it could cost at least 2 billion New Zealand dollars or US$1.4 billion for reconstruction. ""An absolute miracle that no one died,"" Prime Minister John Key said. Two were seriously injured from this quake and thousands of local residents were awakened after being shaken at 4:35 a.m. of that Saturday. There were people trapped inside the damaged buildings but fortunately none were reported dead from the rubble of the damaged buildings. ""We're all feeling scared--we've just had some significant aftershocks,"" a survivor told TV One News. ""Tonight we're just people in the face of a massive natural disaster, trying to help each other and we're grateful we haven't lost a life."" GNS Science reported 29 aftershocks within the 14 hours after the quake, with strength from magnitude 3.7 to 5.4. _ . The country experiences more than 14,000 earthquakes a year--but only about 150 are felt by people. ""Many buildings here were built with earthquake protection measure. However, in most cities in developing countries, people build how they want to and there're no building controls to force them to build to a higher standard that's safe,"" Andrew Charleson, an architecture professor at Victoria University of Wellington told CNN."

The ceremonies of Coming of Age Day for 20 dated back to _ .	Coming of Age Day is a Japanese holiday held on the second Monday of January. It is held in order to help all those who are 20 or over realize that they have become independent members of society. Coming of age ceremonies have been held since the ancient times in Japan. In the past, boys marked their change to adulthood when they were around 15, and girls celebrated their coming of age when they turned 13 or so. It wasn't until 1876 that 20 became the legal age of adulthood. These days, many women choose to wear traditional clothing---a kind of kimono with special designs. For unmarried women, this type of kimono is the most formal thing they can wear. However, such a full set of formal clothing is expensive, so it is usually either passed down or rented rather than being bought specially for the occasion. Men may also wear traditional clothing. Local city governments host special coming of age ceremonies for 20-year-olds. They gain the right to vote on their twentieth birthday and have new responsibilities as well. So the age of 20 is a big turning point for the Japanese. All young adults who turned or will turn 20 between April 1 of the previous year and March 31 of the current one and who maintain residency in the area are invited to attend. Government officials give speeches, and small presents are handed out to the new adults during the ceremonies. After the ceremonies, the young adults often gather in groups and go to parties.

From the conversation between the author and the Mexican woman, we can infer that the woman _ .	"It is love that makes the world go round. And it is also love that has such power to overcome all difficulties. So we say: ""Love will find a way."" As smile is a facial expression showing pleasure, affection, and friendliness, it is the commonest way to show our good will perfectly without saying anything. A Chinese saying runs: ""never hit a person who is smiling at you."" It is a time-proven fact that the smile is a language all its own-- a universal language--understood by the people of every nation in the world. We may not speak the same tongue as our foreign neighbors, but we smile in the same tongue. We need no interpreter for thus expressing love, happiness, or good will. One day while shopping in a small town in southern California, it was my misfortune to be approached by a clerk whose personality contradicted mine. He seemed most unfriendly and not at all concerned about my intended purchase. I bought nothing, and marched angrily out of the store. My anger toward that grew with each step. Outside, standing at the corner, was a dark-complexion young man in his early twenties. His expressive brown eyes met and held mine, and in the next instant a beautiful, dazzling smile covered his face. I gave in immediately. The magnetic power of that shining smile drove away all bitterness within me, and I found the muscles in my own face happily responding. ""Beautiful day, isn't it?"" I remarked, in passing. Then, suddenly something inside me sent me turning back. ""I really owe you a debt of gratitude,"" I said softly. His smile deepened, but he made no attempt to answer. A Mexican woman and two men were standing nearby. The woman stepped forward and eyed me inquiringly. ""Carlos, he no speak English,"" she volunteered. ""You want I should tell him something?"" In that moment I felt transformed. Carlos' smile had made a big person of me. My friendliness and good will toward all mankind stood ten feet tall. ""Yes,"" my reply was enthusiastic and sincere, ""tell him I said 'Thank you!'"" ""Thank you?"" The woman seemed slightly puzzled. I gave her arm a friendly pat as I turned to leave. ""Just tell him that,"" I insisted. ""He'll understand. I am sure!"" Oh, what a smile can do! Although I have never seen that young man again, I shall never forget the lesson he taught me that morning. From that day on, I became smile - conscious, and I practice that diligently, anywhere and everywhere, with everybody. When I got excited in traffic, taking the right-of-way from the other car with my stupid mistake, I'd smile and shrug my shoulders apologetically. This action on my part would always draw a good-natured smile in return. If the other fellow was at fault - and if I could remember my resolution in time! - he'd get a broad smile of understanding. This took a bit of doing at first. I'll admit it wasn't always easy, but it was fun. The results were sometimes amazing. Many times, a broad, friendly smile would completely turn aside ill-feeling and tension. I'm wondering now how many tragic accidents could be avoided on our overcrowded highways, if every driver remembered to smile!"	['knew some English and was ready to help others']

Which statement about the spread of loneliness is true?	A newly-published study has shown that loneliness can spread from one person to another, like a disease. Researchers used information from the Framingham Study, which began in 1948. The Framingham Study gathers information about physical and mental health, personal behavior and diet. At first, the study involved about 5,000 people in the American state of Massachusetts. Now, more than 12,000 individuals are taking part. Information from the Framingham Study showed earlier that happiness can spread from person to person. So can behaviors like littering and the ability to stop smoking. University of Chicago psychologist John Cacioppo led the recent study. He and other researchers attempted to show how often people felt lonely. They found that the feeling of loneliness spread through social groups. Having a social connection with a lonely person increased the chances that another individual would feel lonely. In fact, a friend of a lonely person was 52% more likely to develop feelings of loneliness. A friend of that person was 25% more likely. The researchers say this shows that a person could indirectly be affected by someone's loneliness. The effect was strongest among friends. Neighbors were the second most affected group. The effect was weaker on husbands and wives, and brothers and sisters. The researchers also found that loneliness spread more easily among women than men. The New York Times newspaper reports that, on average, people experience feelings of loneliness about 48 days a year. It also found that every additional friend can decrease loneliness by about five percent, or two and a half fewer lonely days. Loneliness has been linked to health problems like depression and sleeping difficulties. The researchers believe that knowing the causes of loneliness could help in reducing it. The study suggests that people can take steps to stop the spread of loneliness. They can do this by helping individuals they know who may be experiencing loneliness. The result can be helpful to the whole social group.	['Women are more likely to be affected than men.']
What's the most difficult in making friends with neighbors?	If you have no friends around you, it's time that you should know about your neighborhood. Not all of your neighbors out there are friendly, but at least you need to communicate with them. It is common that when you are new to the neighborhood, your neighbors might actually greet you in an inspiring way. In other words, they are pleased to welcome you in their neighbor-hood. Both you and your neighbors may start in getting known to each other by introducing yourselves. This is a sign that you and your neighbors are actually friends. Instead of watching television and playing computer games all the time, you also need to take a break and have some fun talking with your neighbors. But if you want to make friends with them, you need to do something that might please them. The only problem for this situation is that you are afraid to approach and greet them in a nice way. This is a challenge that you or your fellow neighbors must be aware of. You need to get as many friends as possible in your neighborhood, and one of them is to get closer with the unfriendly. If you want to get closer with him but he refuses to be friends with you, don't force him anymore. Treat him with some respect if you don't like to create any more problems. However, if he agrees to be your friend, you are lucky and start treating him like a friend. It is very tough to approach a person in your neighborhood, but it is a good challenge. This is how important for you to get closer with your neighbors, even if they're unfriendly. This is better than sticking yourself alone at home and not having time for social interactions with real people.	['Getting close with the unfriendly neighbors.']
What can be inferred from Sidney's words in the passage?	"""Tom!"" There was no answer. ""Tom!"" Still no answer. ""Where's that boy gone? Tom!"" The old lady looked all around the room. She looked under the bed, but found only the cat. ""If I catch that boy, ..."" she murmured to herself. She opened the door and looked out into the garden. ""Tom!"" she shouted. Then she heard a slight noise behind her. She turned round just in time to catch the boy as he came out of a cupboard. ""And what have you been doing in there?"" ""Nothing,"" said the boy. ""Nothing! Look at your hands and your mouth! What is that stuff?"" ""I don't know, Aunt."" ""Well, I know. It's a jam. I've told you forty times that if you touched that jam, I'd _ you. Give me that stick."" ""Look out, Aunt! Look behind you!"" The old lady turned round and Tom was out of the door in a flash, over the garden fence and away. ""Damn that boy! Will I never learn? He's always playing tricks on me. And he seems to know just now how far he can go, too. But I can't take a stick to him. I really can't. After all, he's my dead sister's boy. Ah well, he'll play truant today and I'll have to make him work tomorrow."" At supper Aunt Polly tried to trick Tom into admitting that he hadn't gone to school. ""It was rather hot today, wasn't it, Tom?"" ""Yes,"" answered Tom. ""You didn't have to open your shirt collar where I sewed it, then."" Tom was confident, now. He opened his jacket. His collar was securely sewed. ""Oh Tom,"" said Aunt Polly. ""You're a good boy really."" She was sorry that she had been wrong about him. ""But Aunt,"" came a voice. It was Sidney, Tom's younger brother. ""Didn' t you sew Tom's collar with white cotton? Look! Now it's black. Tom was already running out of the door. ---The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain"	"[""Tom didn't go to school that day.""]"
What is NOT explained in the passage?	"A recent survey of 2000 parents in Britain showed that they are often afraid of science questions asked by their curious children only because they have no idea what the answer is. Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits ""raised area"" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months."	['Why do birds travel in winter?']
Who was the owner of the earring lost on the bus according go the passage?	"Around twenty years ago I was going through hard times. I could not find a satisfying job. To my shame, I had to drive a school bus to make ends meet and lived in a friend's house. One afternoon, while driving through a quiet suburban neighborhood I was so sad that I kept asking myself ""Why has my life become so hard?"" ""What's wrong with the world?"" Then I pulled over the bus to drop off a little girl and as she passed she handed me a pretty earring, saying she found it on the floor of the bus and I should keep it in case the owner came to look for it. In the evening, the owner did come to look for her earring. When I handed it to her, she got very excited and continued saying ""Thanks, you're a real gentleman."" I told her that she should thank the little girl who had found it. She said, ""Yes, and you are a good driver, too. What a lovely world it is!"" Then she left with satisfaction. I was touched by her last words. I had thought something was wrong with the world just because of my poor condition. In fact, nothing was wrong with the world. I should change my attitude towards life. I should be positive about life. At first it was hard, and then it got easier. Every day I could find things to make me happy. Then one night there was a phone call for me at my friend's house from a lady who was a manager in a large hospital. She said she had read my application form and asked me if I would like to work in the hospital. I said yes and got the job. Looking back at the experience I know the most important is to have a positive attitude towards life."	['Not mentioned']
Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage.	When the world was very young, people lived in hot places .They didn't live in cold places because they could not keep warm there. At first men didn't know how to make a fire. Sometimes trees were hit by lightning .Then a fire was started .People took some of the fire near their homes. A fire was very important for three reasons. It kept them warm. Wild animals were frightened when they saw it. And when food was cooked, it tasted much better. But men didn't know how to make a fire. When they had a fire, they didn't let it stop burning. If it went out, they couldn't start it again. They had to wait for lightning to start another fire. Sometimes they had to wait for years. Later, they learned how to make a fire. But it was not easy to make something burn . Now we have matches. We can carry them in our pockets and make a fire when we want to.	['After man knew how to make a fire, it became very easy to burn something .']
According to the passage, which kind of bike is least likely to be stolen?	Jumping on your bike, even in the city, is becoming increasingly popular--- in London, for example, cycle use has more than doubled in the past ten years. So, which is the best bike for you? If you're traveling to work, a folding bike such as one of the models here is suitable unless you're cycling more than a couple of miles, in which case it might be uncomfortable . You can take a fold-up on the train and as it goes indoors with you, it's secure . For longer journeys, a road bike with drop handlebars and narrow tyres is a good choice. Try Specialized, from PS400. Note that the riding position encourages you to look downwards, which can be dangerous. Mountain bikes are best suited to off-road travel; their fat and strong tyres are good for climbing steep, muddy slopes . Good brands include Trek and Giant, with prices starting at less than PS300. A hybrid bike (halfway between a mountain bike and a road bike) is a good compromise with more upright riding position and thin, fast tyres. Ridgeback makes great hybrids, from around PS350. For a classic sit-up-and-beg bike, it's still hard to beat Pashley, which makes its bikes by hand. Expect to pay around PS500. Once you've picked your bike, sizing is crucial or you may suffer back or neck pain. A famous bike shop will help you choose the right size frame. The height of the seat should be adjusted carefully---again, a good shop will advise. If you only plan to cycle once or twice a month, you can choose a lower-priced bike, but for regular use, paying more means better quality: cheaper bikes need more frequent adjustment of brakes and gears ---and tend to be heavier, too. Finally, items such as mudguards aren't always included.	['A folding bike.']
Which is NOT right according to the passage?	Why are first ladies so important in the United States? They are unpaid and have no official work? There are several reasons, but the most important reason is that they are role models for other women in the United States. Jacqueline Kennedy was the best first lady in the US. Although she wasn't an actress, model or singer, she was a fashion and cultural icon who charmed people wherever she went. If you are looking for someone who is as charming as Jacqueline Kennedy, it will be hard to find anyone more suitable than Peng Liyuan, wife of Chinese President Xi Jinping. If you were writing a novel and trying to describe the perfect mixture of personal history, capabilities, confident lady for a character, you'd come up with someone like Peng. Born into a family in Shandong province, she joined the People's Liberation Army at the age of 18, doing pretty well in singing military songs. But she is not only famous for her voice and great achievements, but also for her charity efforts. She has, among other things, worked as a member of World Health Organization to fight against AIDS, and has done much for 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The media reported Peng's trip with her husband. This was Xi's first foreign trip as president. The trip shows that she can be a role model for Chinese women, especially young Chinese women at home and abroad. In the past, China has not had a tradition of first ladies like in the US. Now that China has a higher position on the world stage, it can have its first first lady! And Peng Liyuan is the perfect person with whom to begin.	['Peng Liyuan wrote military songs from the age of 18.']
It can be inferred from the passage that_.	During my first two months in China, I was like a girl in love. Everything I saw and did amazed me. I have journal entries that are pages long describing, in great detail, everything I ate. From the sauce to the kind of chopsticks I used, nothing went unnoticed or unrecorded. Chinese people gape at me when they see me using chopsticks, just because I can. Western eating is so different, not only in the use of cutlery , but also in the rules of eating, for which there are many. For example, everything is cut before it's eaten, except salad. Instead of eating around the bone, as we do here (I do it too, of course), people cut around the bones, which makes eating fish a difficult thing. Also, there is a certain way to eat soup, which involves pushing the spoon away from you, to make sure you don't get splashed, and never slurping or touching your teeth on the spoon. Before I came here, I thought table manners were very important. Now I think that they are silly, worrying and concentrating on changing the fork and knife every time you cut your food takes away from the enjoyment of food. Every time I eat at a restaurant, I try something new. I am not afraid of trying anything and I will eat anything once. At first I would try a bite and not like it. This happened with fish heads, snake, anything spicy, and bitter melon, to name a few. Now I like all of these things. My new favorite dish is spicy fish heads. There are vegetables whose names I don't know in English. I am proficient in Chinese food, and am also at least ten pounds heavier than when I first arrived. I never even like rice before I came here, and now I have it with every meal. I don't like cheese either, and Western food just doesn't taste as good as it once did. Even McDonald's is better here.

Which of the following statements best proves that Horie's latest voyage was meaningful?	"Japanese sailor Kenichi Horie has finished a 110-day solo voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a boat pushed by sea waves to win another world first. Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. ""When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,"" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific. He made the three-month voyage from his hometown in spite of breaking Japanese law, which did not allow his citizens to sail on their own out of the country, and without a passport or money. He was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco but the city mayor freed him, gave him a 30-day visa and made him an honorary citizen. News of his achievement made him a hero back home in Japan and his book of the voyage In the Pacific was made into a film. Since then, he has completed many sailing trips across the Pacific and around the world. After his latest adventure with an environmentally friendly theme, Horie planned to return to his hometown on Sunday. He said, ""Throughout history, mankind has used wind for power, but no one has appeared to be serious about wave power."" Horie told the reporter, ""I think I'm a lucky boy as this wave power system has remained untouched in fact."""	['His voyage had the theme of protecting the environment.']

Who wrote the story?	One day a few years ago a very funny thing happened to a neighbor of mine. He is a teacher at one of London's big medical schools, He had finished his teaching for the summer term and was at the airport on his way to Russia to give a lecture. He had put a few clothes and his lecture notes in his shoulder bag, but he had put Rupert, the skeleton to be used in his lecture, in a large brown suitcase . At the airport desk, he suddenly thought that he had forgotten to buy a newspaper. He left his suitcase near the desk and went over to the shop. When he got back he discovered that someone had taken his suitcase by mistake. He often wonders what they said when they got home and found Rupert.	"[""The teacher's neighbour.""]"
What was the first impression that the boy gave the author?	I was fairly new to this particular school since my parents only moved to the area. There was a boy, who, as it turned out, was an orphan and was living and working for a small farming family. He didn't appear at first glance to ever be fully engaged in the school learning process;he would sit quietly, never seem to get any attention from the teacher, and would spend a lot of time staring out of the window just behind him. Over the next few weeks, I got to know this boy while playing outside in the schoolyard playing baseball, or soccer. He was very athletic and very good at anything we played. I started to wonder why he didn't seem to do well in school and why the teacher ignored him. He told me he had been in several foster homes since he was a little boy and that most of his time in the last few years had always been on farms. He said he was made to work before he went to school and as soon as he got home until it was time for bed. He was never given a chance to go out and play, nor was he allowed to have any friends although he told me he really didn't have any friends anyway, because he was an orphan and they did not want anything to do with him. I had never before been acquainted with prejudice of any kind. Here was one characteristic of a human being who through no fault of his own carried a label that prevented him from even having friends as a child. His potential was also being ignored by the teacher. It wasn't that he couldn't learn, or didn't want to -- it was because he wasn't encouraged or in some cases, allowed to. We may all meet people through the years that we tend to apply labels to without really taking the time to get to know them, to discover their real potential because our vision is clouded by how we always put people into _ that we are used to or comfortable with.	['He was not drawn into learning.']
What can we learn from the passage?	"Using a computer or smartphone at night can cause us to pile on the pounds,new research has revealed. The study found a link between blue light exposure(blue light is produced by smartphones and computers)and increased hunger.It found that exposure to blue light increases hunger levels for several hours and even increases hunger levels after eating a meal.Blue light exposure has also already been shown to cause decreased sleepiness in the evening,increasing the risk of sleeplessness. The leading researcher,Ivy Cheung,from Northwestern University in Chicago,said,""A single three-hour exposure to blue-enriched light in the evening greatly affected hunger and metabolism .These results are important because they suggest that controlling environmental light exposure for humans may represent a _ approach of influencing food intake patterns and metabolism."" The study group consisted of 10 healthy adults with regular sleep and eating schedules. They completed a four-day trial under dim light conditions,which involved exposure to less than 20 lux(,)during 16 hours awake and less than 3 lux during eight hours of sleep.On the third day they were exposed to three hours of 260 lux,blue-enriched light starting10.5 hours after waking up.and the effects were compared with dim light exposure. Ivy Cheung said more research is needed to determine the functions involved in the relationship between light exposure,hunger and metabolism."	['The researchers drew their conclusion by comparison.']
By writing the passage, the author intends to _ .	"My mother has always instilled in me the importance of education. Education is essential. It will help me get accepted to college if I perform well academically and advance my opportunities for success in the future. Most jobs now require at least a high school diploma, and for many jobs, a college degree is preferred. It is important that all students have excellent educators in their life to help them achieve and have the opportunity to go to college, get a job, support themselves and their family, and impact the community. As we celebrate and honor all teachers during Teacher Appreciation Week, I've reflected on the impact my teachers have had, and will continue to have, in my life. From Mr. Bowker, who challenged me in math, to Mr. Bernsteen, my health teacher who taught me the value of hard work, my teachers have helped shape the student I am today. But one of the teachers who left a lasting impression on me was my summer school teacher, Mr. Davis, who impacted me beyond the classroom. He found time to connect with me on a personal level and talk to me after class. I felt like Mr. Davis cared about my academic success and was committed to setting an example of what's possible. Mr. Davis could relate to what it was like to be a rising ninth-grade black male in today's society. He taught me how to speak up confidently and share my ideas with others. He told me that I was brilliant and that when I spoke, the world should listen. And when I would put my hand down because I was unsure of my answer, Mr. Davis would immediately say, ""No _ , no glory."" He never made me feel inadequate; he encouraged me to always pursue knowledge because he, too, was learning every day. Mr. Davis helped me navigate the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities. I think having more black male teachers like Mr. Davis in the classroom could increase student success. They would share the background and experiences of many of their students and help build long-lasting teacher/student relationships. But, unfortunately, the likelihood that students of color in Nevada will have a teacher that looks like them is one of the lowest in the country. As the student population becomes more ethnically diverse, teachers in Nevada still are predominantly white. According to a 2012 Education Week report, in the Clark County School District, nearly 70 percent of students identified as students of color, but 76 percent of teachers were white. The numbers for black male teachers are more discouraging. Just 2 percent of teachers nationwide are black men. But you can help change the numbers. Whether you decide to study education in college or graduate school, or apply to programs in Las Vegas such as Teach For America, I hope more black males will consider teaching as a career. My peers and I need more examples of excellence and success in classrooms--examples who look like us. You can be the model to impact our life and push us to achieve. You can ensure that, when we look to the front of the room, we can see a little bit of ourselves reflected back."	['appeal to more black males to be teachers']

Beginning college can be an exciting but awkward time. Follow these tips to adjust to your new life rapidly and make the most of your college experience. * To save time and money, use the college' s bus system. Taking the bus to school is quick, easy and free in most college towns. You won' t have to locate or afford a place to park either. It' s also a good way to be environmentally aware. * Save pennies on books by waiting until class starts. You might not even need all of the recommended books. New textbooks cost an arm and a leg. Try buying used textbooks -- it' s a surefire way to save money and serves the purpose as well. * Do never look at college life as an endless series of parties and social activities. But there is a whole lot more to college if you're serious about graduating. Having a good college experience is all about balancing work and fun. * Be mindful of your diet. Make healthy food choices and watch what you eat. Avoid foods that are processed or high in sugar. The ""freshman 15""is real. Many college students gain at least 15 pounds during their freshmen year. * While electives can be helpful when figuring out your major, you shouldn't entirely rely on them. Clubs and other organizations exist around. Get involved. Make sure, though, that you still have time to study. Having too much on your plate can hurt your grades."

What would be the best title for the passage ?	Naturally ,American schoolchildren love holidays .And they get a lot of them each year .Besides having national holidays such as Thanksgiving and Presidents; Day off from school ,students get longer breaks in the US only go to school for about 180 days a year.To students ,holidays are perfect .However ,parents think there are advantages and disadvantages . On the one hand ,school holidays allow families to spend time together .Many American parents take time off from work during June,July or august to travel with their children on vacations either in the US or in a foreign country .On the other hand ,schoolchildren get much more time off school than parents get vacation for an time.This means that parents with young children may have to pay more in the babysitting or day care coats.As well ,the long summer holidays mean that students sometimes get bored. Besides going on trips with their parents ,American students enjoy taking part in different kind s of activities during the holidays .For example ,some kids enjoy summer camps and outdoor adventure holidays .Such trips are great adventurous students . _ also have a lot to offer students who aren't usually interested in traditional PE activities .ou can do courses in survival skills ,for example .Students learn how to make a camp in the forest ,which wild food they can eat and how to find their way to make a camp in the forest,which wild food they can eat and how to find their way back to the center.

For podcast, which is wrong?	"Every day we are bombarded with images, videos, music and news. In this age of visual and aural hyper-stimulation, the medium of radio is making a phenomenal comeback. ""We're at the dawn of a golden age of audio,"" said US-based podcaster Alex Blumberg in an article in The Sydney Morning Herald. In the last month alone, 15 percent of US adults listened to a radio podcast. These statistics, released by Edison Research, reveal the successful evolution of traditional radio broadcasts to the present day's digital podcast format. The term ""podcast,"" was coined in 2004, but the trend only started gaining mainstream popularity in recent years. Since the leap in consumer demand for smartphones and tablets, podcast subscription rates have only accelerated. The appeal of the podcast partially resides in its multiplatform delivery and on-demand capabilities. You can tune in during those extra minutes of the day when you're walking to the shops, waiting in a queue or riding the subway. Similar to television shows, podcasts are generally free to download and most offer new content every week. Donna Jackson, 22, Sydney university media graduate, listens to podcasts two or three times a week, via iTunes .""I listen while I'm pottering around the house doing something else. It makes completing a boring task a lot more enjoyable..... And it's an easy way of keeping in touch with what's going on in the rest of the world,"" she said. Unlike television and music, the audio format has the potential to create a deep impression on readers. Blumberg says this comes down to the podcast's ability ""to create intimacy and emotional connection."" Sydney University undergraduate Hazel Proust, major in social work and arts, agrees. ""When you're tuned in, it feels as if the voice of the podcast's narrator is talking directly to you. It's comforting,"" said Proust."	['You can listen to it at any time and any place.']
What can we learn about iPhone from the passage?	"Apple Inc co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs, counted among the greatest American CEOs of his generation, died on Wednesday at the age of 56, after a-year-long and highly public battle with cancer. Jobs' death was announced by Apple in a statement late on Wednesday. The Apple.com homepage featured a black-and-white picture of him with the words ""Steve Jobs, 1955-2011"". A message on the site read, ""Apple has lost an imaginary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring leader."" ""His greatest love was for his wife, Laurene, and his family. Our hearts go out to them and to all who were touched by his extraordinary gifts."" ""Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple."" The Silicon Valley hero who gave the world the iPod and the iPhone had resigned as CEO of the world's largest technology corporation in August, handing the position to current chief executive Tim Cook. Two years before the iPhone that forever transformed the way people around the world access and use the Internet, Jobs talked about how a sense of his death was a major driver behind that vision. ""Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever got to help me make the big choices in life,"" Jobs said during a Stanford commencement ceremony in 2005. ""Because almost everything-all others' expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure-these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important."" ""Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."""

What should we do in order not to make Mother Nature angry?	In Singapore,most of us love window-shopping while some others enjoy having a picnic at East Coast Park or Changi Beach on sunny days.Singaporeans are never bothered by the occasional thunderstorm.However,we know that if it rains for long continuous periods,there will be more serious effects.Just recently the main shopping street of Orchard Road was flooded and some part of Bukit Timah was impassable to traffic.People reacted by writing in to the newspaper to complain about this! We forget that other countries suffer much worse effects. Elsewhere,heavy tropical storms often result in floods that ruin crops especially in Thailand and Malaysia.This in turn usually means that the price of rice and vegetables here in Singapore will rise because we import these products from them.If there is a typhoon or tsunami,thousands of lives are lost too.This happened in Indonesia and Phuket in Thailand in 2004 and _ serves to remind us of how Mother Nature can cause great damage. Weather patterns in general have changed dramatically in recent years.Scientists believe that global warming and the resulting melting of the polar ice-cap has caused the level of the ocean to rise.This in turn causes flooding of low-lying areas in countries where the land is rather flat and some parts of which is below water level.It is believed that human activities have caused Mother Nature to show her extreme anger,so it is now important that we really work together to cut down on harmful activities,for example,illegal logging or irresponsible forest-burning to clear land for farming.

Although a lot of unfortunate matters happened to Jean, she is still _ .	"Well I decided to cut my front lawn today, especially since I live on a main street downtown with lots of traffic. Anyway, I finished mine and decided to cut my neighbor--Jean's grass while I was at it. She is a sweet person who has gone through some _ times in the last year. Her brother passed away of cancer last year; her sister (who lives with her) is mentally challenged--yet so sweet! It was a difficult time with physical and mental challenges that led her employer in our local hospital to let her go after 25 years of service! Lastly, my neighbor Jean, who is a nurse in our local hospital, was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in December. She went through radiation and a long recovery--but thankful she is in remission . Anyway, in short I was leaving my house this afternoon and she stopped me to thank me for cutting her grass. She told me her dad passed away on Friday and she just arrived home from the funeral service, so she didn't know when I would have time to cut her grass. So, when she arrived home and saw it cut she was more than happy and grateful! I said to her ""You are welcome, just a small act of kindness for a neighbor."" I did it for exercise and shared pleasure not knowing it meant more to her than just doing a neighbor a favor!"	['optimistic']
"Why did the writer smile inside when he heard of ""Mrs. Icicle Eyes"" playing basketball with students?"	"""Men get all the breaks!"" the veteran teacher announced to me. A cold greeting. Her stare stabbed like an icicle . ""Hello,"" I countered, extending my hand. ""I guess we'll be teaching together this year."" ""I swear, all you have to do is wear pants and walk into an elementary school and they hire you! It makes me sick!"" I would have responded, but she turned her back to me and stomped off down the hall. Who would have imagined that the biggest challenge I would face during my first year on the job would not be students, but fellow teachers? ""You can't put that there!"" Another teacher burst into my classroom. ""You can't put the teacher's desk at the back of the room!"" ""Pardon?"" ""If you put your desk way back there, you won't be able to see them cheating!"" Next I was told I must not arrange student desks into abutting clusters because ""the students might talk too much."" At home my wife kept assuring me, ""You're there for the kids. When you meet your students, things will be different."" And she was right. One day the bell rang and there were thirty-five wonderful sixth graders sitting at their desks (still arranged in clusters) and it was different. I was happy. ""Welcome to sixth grade."" I began the year as I'd rehearsed for months. ""You'll notice,"" I continued, ""my desk is at the back of the room."" They chuckled. ""I don't want that desk between us. I want to be involved in your learning and involved in your lives."" In the days that followed, I ate with my students at lunch ("" _ ""); I played with my students at recess ("" _ ""); I read with my students in the library ("" _ ""); I even stayed after school with some boys who got in trouble with the principal ("" _ ""). I went home to my wife. ""Don't worry,"" she said. ""They're just threatened by you because you're new and you're good. Let the other teachers know you're not a threat. Just keep being nice to them."" Obediently, I pulled out the Golden Rule, dusted it off, and vowed to start again. As I did with the children, I started looking for specific, positive things I could build upon and reinforce sincerely in my colleagues: ""Nice job on the announcements this morning!"" ""Wow! I like that worksheet you made up."" ""Man, your kids walked down the hall so quietly."" ""I heard your class singing great songs. You do a super job with music!"" ""I like your bulletin board,"" I said to Mrs. Icicle Eyes. ""Really?"" she asked. ""It's just the same old thing I put up every year."" She reached out and straightened a sagging border. Then, not unlike one of my students, she added, ""Do you really like it?"" ""Yes,"" I answered firmly. As sure as sun beams, the Golden Rule was shining, and things were finally warming up. That very afternoon, a few parents went to the principal's office asking if their sixth graders could be moved into my class. Of course the students were not transferred, but when the grapevine circulated the request, up went the old barbed wire fence. Complete with machine guns. I continued to do the best job I could. I worked. I taught. I cared. I waited for a breakthrough moment. Months passed. It was lunch recess. I asked a boy walking down the hall. ""Have you seen Mrs. So-and-So?"" I was, in fact, searching for Mrs. Icicle Eyes. I needed to consult with her. Grinning, he came toward me as if sharing a secret. ""She's outside shooting baskets with the girls!"" ""She's playing basketball with the girls?"" I asked incredulously. ""Yeah,"" he nodded. I smiled. I didn't say another word. But my smile inside was even bigger than the one on my face."

Which of the following is true, according to the passage?	"""The world has never been a better place to live in"" says science writer Matt Ridley, ""and it will keep on getting better."" Read on to see how Ridley makes his case. Right or wrong? You decide. Compared with 50 years ago, when I was just four years old, people now make nearly three times as much money, eat one third more food and expect to live one third longer. In fact, it's hard to find any areas of the world that's worse off now than it was then, even though the world population has more than doubled over that period. One reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ever before is that the four most basic human needs--food, clothing, fuel and shelter--have grown much cheaper. Take one example: In 1800, a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s, the same light from a lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950, it was eight seconds. Today, it's half a second. In these terms, we are 43,200 times better off than in1800. In the United States, rivers, lakes, seas and air are getting cleaner all the time. A car today produces less pollution traveling at full speed than a parked car did from leaks in 1970. Although the world population is growing, the rate of increase has been falling for 50 years. Across the world, national birth rates are lower now than in 1960, and in the less developed world, the birth rate has almost halved. According to a research report from the United Nations, population will start falling once it reaches 9.2 billion in 2075. After all, there are already seven billion people on earth, and they are eating better and better. In 1970s, there were 550 billion barrels of oil reserves in the world, and in the 20 years that followed the world used up 600 billion. So by 1990, reserves should have been overused by 50 billion barrels. Instead, it is reported there are 900 billion today. They will last for many years and people will find something in place of oil long before they run out. The more we develop, the more we can develop. The more we invent, the more inventions become possible. For 200 years, pessimists (people who believe that terrible things will happen in future) have had all the headlines--even though _ have far more often been right. There are some reasons for pessimists. No charity ever raised money by saying things are getting better. No journalist ever got the front page writing a story about how terrible things won't happen. Don't be a pessimist--dare to be an optimist!"	"[""It's not necessary to be worried about oil reserves in the world.""]"
According to the passage, the final mouth shape is formed _ .	Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do.	['sometime after new teeth are set']
"Which of the following can replace ""chef""?"	"On 15 September 1918 Lee Duncan, an American soldier, rescued a half-starved shepherd and her five puppies from a bombed dog's kennel on the battle fields ofprefix = st1 /France.Duncanchose two of the dogs, a male and female, while members of his group took the mother and the others back to camp. The only survivors over the next few months were the two pups Duncan had claimed, naming them 'Rin Tin Tin' and 'Nannette' after tiny French puppets the French children would give to the American soldiers for good luck. When the war ended, Duncan made special arrangements to take his pups back to his home in Los Angeles, but during the Atlantic crossing, Nannette became ill and died, shortly after arriving inAmerica. In 1922, Duncan and Rin Tin Tin attended an LA dog show, his dog performing for the crowd with an impressive high jump. After the show,Duncanreceived $350 for Rin's performance. That was the beginning of Rin Tin Tin's later involvement in many films and television series It happened that Warners had difficulty shooting an exterior scene with a wolf as they got into a low budget. Duncanquickly approached the director and told them that his dog could do the scene in one take. True to his word, Rin did the scene in one take. As a result, he and his dog were hired for the entire shoot of ""Man From Hells River"". The film was a hit and Rin Tin Tin became a box-office star. It was the first American dog movie star. It made 26 pictures for Warners while starring in his own live 1930s radio show ""The Wonder Dog"". At the peak of his popularity, Warners kept 18 trained stand-ins to reduce any stress on their dog star. The star dog was worthy of the honor of having its private _ to prepare daily lunches for him. As a band was playing classical music it slowly consumed a lunch of tenderloin steak."	['cook']

The writer mainly wants to tell us_.	Olympic medalist Dara Torres, the 41-year-old swimmer, is more than a feel-good story. Torres is as determined and driven in her daily life as she is in the pool. She is dedicated to pursuing her passions and following her dreams-something she hopes to instill in her 2-year-old daughter and women and girls everywhere. After all, her dreams took her to Beijing. Upon her return after the Olympics, SUCCESS writer Don Yaeger, caught up with Torres, who shared her insights. What insights can you offer others ( non-athletes, too) about setting and staying on track to reach goals? Everyone has his highs and lows when doing things, but you have to remember what the end result is when you're having those tough times. I think about the end and about my feelings of success, and that keeps me going. I definitely set goals for myself and try not to get too distracted trying to reach them. And always remember to have fun ! Any strategies or tips for overcoming mental obstacles to be your very best? Mental obstacles are tough. For my personally, if I was having mental obstacles, I would talk to my coach, who was the most important person to me during this comeback. It's so important to have that person in your life, a trusted advisor. Communication is very important, and I've learned it's OK to turn to others if you're having a tough time. When I was younger, I would internalize(...) things. Not any more. It's a great relief to be able to share.	['Dara Torres pursues her passions in the pool and in life']
From the passage we can know that _ .	"I lay on the bed trying to put on my favorite pair of pants, pulling and dragging, but the zipper wouldn't close. Angrily I threw them to the back of the closet. I found a long large skirt, tied it around my middle, and then joined my husband downstairs. I caught sight of myself in the halfway mirror--I didn't like the person I saw. The weight kept climbing higher each year. The problem was that I hated the word ""diet"". To me it meant my keeping off every good thing I loved. Later that summer, I found myself out of breath when I climbed two flights of stairs and my heart started beating heavily. I saw my doctor and she told me that I needed to bring down my blood pressure. ""Easy for her to say,"" I thought when I drove back home. Up ahead I saw a McDonald's. I pulled in. The doctor's warning couldn't resist the pull of McDonald's food. The next morning I stepped on the scale and weighed more than I had ever had in my life. Just at the very moment, my thoughts were finally clear. To check the weight I needed to control my choices. Several days later, I went to my favorite restaurant for lunch--I only chose Chinese chicken salad. I felt great when I left the restaurant carrying a take-home box filled with half of that huge salad. But most of all, I discovered I had control over my choices. The weight came off slowly, but after a while it made no progress. Eating a light meal a couple of nights a week would help, but that meant I would prepare two separate dinners, for I would have to continue to make my husband his favorite meals, who supported my weight loss goal. Dusting off the old two--wheel vehicle in the garage, I added exercise by pedaling for 30 minutes after dinner. A year later I lost 25 pounds and my blood pressure was normal. I tried on my favorite pants again. They fit perfectly."	"[""the author's effort to lose weight turned out to be successful""]"
What would be the best title for the text?	"Most people want to know how things are made. They honestly admit, however, that they hardly know a thing when it comes to understanding how a piece of music is made. Where a composer begins, how he manages to keep going - in fact, how and when he learns his trade - all are covered in complete darkness. The composer, in short, is a man of mystery . One of the first things the common man wants to know about is the part inspiration plays in a composer's work. He finds it difficult to believe that composers are not much interested in that question. Writing music is as natural for the composer as eating or sleeping for all. Music is something that the composer happens to have been born for. The composer, therefore, does not say to himself: ""Do I feel inspired?"" He says to himself: ""Do I feel like working today?"" And if he feels like working, he does. It is more or less like saying to himself: ""Do I feel sleepy?"" If you feel sleepy, you go to sleep. If you don't feel sleepy, you stay up. If the composer doesn't feel like working, he doesn't work. It's as simple as that."	['Composer: a man of mystery']
According to the passage, an excursion .	Normally and naturally, a daughter is more attached to her mother in comparison to her father or other siblings . The attachment is also due to the fact that the daughter finds it easier to believe in the mother on personal and biological matters at different stages while growing up. The bonding between mother and daughter will increase with their being together and going out on excursions. An excursion is a journey to some far-off place undertaken by people. It is not necessary that such a trip be taken on a lavish scale involving lots of money. It can be as short as an overnight trip to some place to improve bonding. To surprise her daughter with an unexpected excursion, mother can plan a trip to some local spa without the knowledge of her daughter. She can be ready with baggage packed and wait for the moment the daughter comes back from school. Once in the hotel they can enjoy the night together getting refreshing treatments like massage or mud packs. After relaxing spa they can laze in bed, enjoying favourite food or drink and if possible enjoying nature through the window. After a long period of relaxation, going out for a walk together will improve bonding. Going out overnight to enjoy walk at the beach, and relaxing at intervals without the interference of any other person can be a great idea of bonding. Being of the same sex, and often having the same set of likes and dislikes, they can spend time on makeup or applying nail polish. The daughter should never forget to thank the mother for the wonderful time they spent together, and the mother should never hesitate to say a few words of praise to the daughter. Going out for shopping together is a good bonding idea too. It is not essential that lots of money should be spent on shopping. The mother can take the daughter to some shops where she can buy her uniform or some other things. They can jointly enjoy window shopping, expressing love and gratitude for the other.	['can be a short overnight trip']
What's the main idea of the text?	"Global Positioning Systems are now a part of everyday driving in many countries.These satellitebased systems provide turnbyturn directions to help people get to where they want to go.However,they can also cause a lot of problems,send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost.Many times,the driver is to blame.Sometimes a GPS error is responsible.Most often,says Barry Brown,it is a combination of the two. Barry Brown is with the Mobile Life Centre in Stockholm,Sweden.He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States.There he borrowed a GPSequipped car to use during his stay.Mr Brown says,""They just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination.And,then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes that they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived.They actually put their home address in.So again,the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'."" Mr Brown says this is a common human error,but what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings,or failures,of GPS equipment.He says,""One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn.Because they just give you the next turn,sometimes that means that it is not really giving you the overview that you would need to know that it's going to the wrong place."" Mr Brown says,""One of the things that struck us,perhaps the most important thing was that you have to know what you're doing when you use a GPS.There are these new skills that people have developed.There are these new competencies that you need to have to be able to use a GPS because they sometimes go wrong.This goes against a common belief that GPS systems are for passive drivers who lack navigational skills."" Barry Brown says to make GPS systems better we need a better understanding of how drivers,passengers and GPS systems work together."	['Driving with GPS can be difficult to navigate  .']
What would be the best title of this passage?	"Teenagers at one German school are learning how to achieve happiness alongside subjects like maths and languages. The class sit in a circle with their eyes shut and count from one to ten: one begins, the next voice comes from the far right, a third from the other side. The aim is to listen for an opportunity to shout the number without clashing with another voice or leaving a pause. On the first try, most of the young Germans try to be first, while a few are too shy to join in. But by the fifth round, they develop a rhythm. The message: giving other people space but also confidently claiming your own space is a requirement for social well-being. While the game suggests a soft course for the less bright, the school says it is trying to make it affect even clever pupils. The Willy Hellpach School is the first in the nation to develop a happiness course, intended for 17-19-year-olds preparing for university-entrance exams. ""The course isn't there to make you happy,"" Ernst Fritz-Schubert, the school principal, warned the pupils who were taking the course, ""but rather to help you discover the ways to become happy."" Cooking a meal together will be one of the class exercises, along with improving body language under the guidance of two professional actresses. ""In the first period, we had to each say something positive about another member of the class and about ourselves. No laughing at people or teasing,"" said Fanny, 17. The message: self-esteem improves happiness too. The course is taught for three periods a week and will be graded as a part of overall assessment. Despite the happy subject, the pupils themselves insist it is no laughing matter. Max, 18, says he is happy when he finds people who share his interests. Janina, 18, says she needs to be fit to feel happy. ""We want to show how proper food or exercise can help in becoming happy,"" the principal said. He hopes other schools in Germany will copy the idea. The school has attracted national interest since it announced its new course."	['Learning How to Be Happy.']
What can we learn about the village site?	"Researchers have found a village that may have been home to the builders of Stonehenge. The village of small houses dates back to about 2600 BC. That's about the same time Stonehenge was built. ""Clearly, this is a place that was of great importance,"" said researcher Mike Parker Pearson. The ancient houses are at a site known as Durrington Walls. It is about 3.2 kilometers from Stonehenge. Researchers believe Stonehenge was a memorial site or cemetery for the villagers. The village also had a wooden version of the stone circle. It may have been used by people attending festivals at Stonehenge. Eight of the houses have been dug up. Researchers say there may be as many as 25 of them. The wooden houses were square and about 5 meters along each side. There are signs that there were beds along the walls. There are also signs of a storage unit. The houses also had fireplaces. Two of the houses were separate from the others. They may have been the homes of community leaders. Researchers say those didn't have the household rubbish that was found in the other homes. Stone tools, animal bones, arrowheads and other things were found throughout the village site. Stonehenge is a popular tourist spot in England. It is a huge circle made out of stones, which were placed in a grass field in southern England. The stone arches were made with two stones at the bottom and one across the top. All of the stones weigh a lot more than a big car. Scientists have long wondered not only how people built Stonehenge, but also why."	['Each of the wooden houses is about 25 square meters.']

On each potato the students had to write a name of a person that they hated And the next day, every child brought some potatoes. Some had two potatoes;some three;some up to five. Mrs. Smith then told the children to carry the bags everywhere they went, even to the toilet, for two weeks. As day after day passed, the children started to complain about the awful smell of the rotten potatoes. Those children who brought five potatoes began to feel the weight trouble of the bags. After two weeks, the children were happy to hear that the game was finally ended. Mrs. Smith asked,""How did you feel while carrying the potatoes for two weeks?"" The children started complaining about the trouble loudly. Then Mrs. Smith told them why she asked them to play the game. She said,""This is exactly the situation when you carry your hatred for somebody inside your heart. The terrible smell of the hatred will pollute your heart and you will carry something unnecessary with you all the time. If you cannot stand the smell of the rotten potatoes for just two weeks, can you imagine how heavy it would be to have the hatred in your heart for your lifetime? So throw away any hatred from your heart, and you'll be really happy. ,."	['names']

"According to the passage, during all of those years, ""we"" were told all of the following EXCEPT _ ."	"One day, a young man visited a small farm in the countryside. As he got closer to the farm, he saw many chickens and an eagle playing together. He then went up to the farm house and talked to the farmer, ""Sir, I was just passing by and I saw that you have many chickens and an eagle."" The farmer smiled and said, ""That's not an eagle. It's a chicken."" The young man kept saying that it was an eagle. He said to the farmer, ""Sir, that is an eagle! I can proveit to you."" The farmer laughed, ""Sure, go ahead."" The young man then pulled that big bird out and climbed a high mountain. He held the bird in his hands and said, ""You are an eagle, fly!"" But the bird failed. The young man tried the second time.

After the young man tried another three times, the bird began to flap its wings. Finally, it flew high and began to fly around the farm. It is true to us.

You can try to escape a fire except _ .	Escaping from a fire is a serious matter. Knowing what to do during a fire can save a life. It is important to know the ways you can use and show them to everyone in the family, for example, you can use stairways, roofs and fire escapes, but no lifts. From the lower floors of buildings, to escape through windows is possible. Learn the best way of leaving by a window with the least chance of serious injury. The second floor window is usually not very high from the ground. An average person, hanging from the window by the fingertips will have a drop of about six feet to the ground--about the height of an average man. Of course, _ Windows are also useful while you are waiting for help. Be sure to keep the door closed, before opening the window. Otherwise, smoke and fire may be drawn into the room. Keep your head low next to the window to be sure you get fresh air. On the second or third floor, the best windows to escape from are those which open onto a roof . From the roof a person can drop to the ground more safely.	['lifts']
Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?	"Watching a 3D movie can more than double the concentration powers and cognitive processing of children, a new research claims. A study made by visual technology firm RealD and led by child psychologist Dr Richard Woolfson suggests that childrenaged between 7 and 14 experienced twice the cognitive processing speed and performed better in testing after watching 20 minutes of a 3D film. This is despite suggestions that attention spans in children have shortened in the last decade due tounlimitedto access to entertainment, including on-demand TV, gaming and social media. A 2015 study claimed that watching 3D content had a similar effect to brain-training exercises. Consumer psychologist Mr Fagan said that the increasedstimulation found in watching something in 3D ""exercised"" the brain and improved performance in the short term. ""3D films can play the role of 'brain-training' games and help to make children 'smarter' in the short term,"" he said. ""The shortening of response times after watching 3D was almost three times as big as that gained from watching 2D; in other words, 3D helps children process aspects of their environment more quickly. This is likely to be because 3D is a mentallystimulatingexperience which 'gets the brain's juices flowing'."" The experiment saw children given a range of cognitive tests before watching 20 minutes of a movie in either 2D or 3D and being tested again. The results showed those who saw the 3D content reacted faster and performed bettering the second round of testing. Mental engagement also rose by 13% among 3D watchers. Child psychologist Dr Woolfson added that ""supportive parenting"" and regularly listening to classical music can also aid a child's memory."

Why didn't the writer help his son?	"I went home one Saturday afternoon in the autumn of 1993 to get some work done in the garden. While sweeping leaves on the ground, my five-year-old son Nick came over and asked me to write something on a piece of paper to make a sign for him. ""What for?"" I asked. ""I'm going to sell some of my stones, "" he answered. Nick _ stones and had collected many stones from all over. ""I'm busy to do that for you. Go and ask your mum for help."" I said. A short time later, Nick returned with a sign, reading. "" Stones. One Dollar Each"". He took the sign, a small chair and 4 of his best stones and walked to the road in front of our garden. There he put the stones in a line and sat down on the chair. After half an hour, nobody passed by. I walked to him and asked him to go back, but he didn't. Another half hour later, a small car came down the road. I watched as Nick stood up, holding his sign up. A woman rolled down a window and read the sign. I couldn't hear their talk, but I saw the woman turn to the driver and the man reach for his pocket. I sat in the yard, as Nick ran to me. Waving the dollar, he shouted. ""I told you I could sell one stone for a dollar -- if you believe in yourself, you can do anything."""	['Because he was busy sweeping leaves.']
What's the reason that the eagle was disciplined?	"Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of"" a new world"".So they organized a training school. They adopted an activity curriculum consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a ""Charlie horse"" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running. The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there. At the end of the year,an abnormal eel that could swim very well,and also run,climb and fly a little,had the highest average and was the one who gave a good-bye speech. The prairie dogs stayed out of the school because the administration would not add digging to the curriculum."	"[""He didn't do as teachers taught.""]"
The lesson we draw from the story is that _ .	"On November18, 1995, Itzhak Perlman, the world famous violinist, came on stage to give a concert at Lincoln Centre in New York City. If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, you know that getting on stage is not easy for him. He got polio as a child, and has to walk with the aid of two crutches now. That night Perlman walked slowly to his chair. Then he sat down and began to play. But, suddenly, one of the strings on his violin broke. You could hear it break---it broke with a loud noise. People thought to themselves, ""He would have to get up to either find another violin or find another string for this one."" But he didn't. Instead, he waited a moment, closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again. The orchestra began, and he played from where he had stopped. He played with such passion and such power. Of course, everyone knows that it is impossible to play a symphonic work with just three strings. But that night Itzhak Perlman refused to know that. You could see him changing and recomposing the piece in his head. When he finished, there was a silence in the room. Then people rose and cheered. We were all on our feet, doing everything we could to show how much we appreciated what he had done. He smiled and then he said in a quiet tone, ""You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can make with what you have left."" His words have stayed in my mind ever since I heard them. That is also the way of life. Perhaps our task in this quickly changing world in which we live is to make music, at first with all that we have, and then, when that is no longer possible, to make music with what we have left."	['we should make the best of what we have']
"In the author's opinion the biggest difference between ""bright"" children and ""not bright"" children lies in _ ."	"When we talk about intelligence, we do not mean the ability to get good scores in certain kinds of tests or even the ability to do well in school. By intelligence we mean a way of living and behaving, especially in a new or anxious situation. If we want to test intelligence, we need to find out how a person acts instead of how much he knows what to do. For example, when in a new situation, an intelligent person thinks about the situation, not about himself or what might happen to him. He tries to find out all he can, and then he acts immediately and tries to do something about it. He probably isn't sure how it will all work out, but at least he tries. And, if he can't make things work out right, he doesn't feel ashamed that he fails; he just tries to learn from his mistakes. An intelligent person, even if he is very young, has a special outlook on life, special feeling about life, and knows how he fits into it. If you look at children, you'll see great difference between what we call ""bright"" children and ""not bright"" children. They are actually two different kinds of people, not just the same kind with different amounts of intelligence. For example, the bright child really wants to find out more about life --- he tries to get in touch with everything around him. But the unintelligent child keeps more to himself and his own dream-world; he seems to have a wall between him and life in general."	['the different attitudes to life']
According to the passage, Mount Yasur _ .	Vanuatu is an island nation in the South Pacific. It is one of the smallest countries in the world. But for those who are interested in adventure and sport, there is a lot to do. Vanuatu's islands offer visitors two of the most exciting and dangerous activities in the world: volcano surfing and land diving. Volcano Surfing On Tanna Island, Mount Yasur rises 300 meters into the sky. Yasur is an active volcano, and it erupts almost every day, sometimes several times a day. For centuries, people have climbed this mountain to visit the top. Recently, people have also started climbing Yasur to surf the volcano. In some ways, volcano surfing is like surfing in the sea, but in other ways it's very different. Volcano surfers try to escape the erupting volcano--without getting hit by flying rocks! It's fast, fun and dangerous--the perfect extreme sport . Land Diving Most people are familiar with bungee jumping, but do you know bungee jumping started on Pentecost Island in Vanuatu and is almost fifteen centuries old? The activity, first called land diving, is part of a religious ceremony . A man ties tree vines to his legs. He then jumps head-first from a high tower to touch the earth with the top of his head--without breaking the vine. Every spring, island natives (men only) still take part in this amazing activity.

The author thinks actors' life is _ .	Many people think it is very exciting and admirable to be an actor. The actors often wear the most beautiful and fashionable clothes and they can make a lot of money. Many people like them and they have so many fans. But in fact, the job of an actor can be very tiring and hard. To make good movies, for example, action movies, the actors need to go to some remote places. There they don't have good places to stay or nice food to eat. They often have to get up early and go to bed very late. When they are too busy, they don't have time to sleep or relax. It's very hard.

Which group makes up the largest percentage of disabled people in China.	China is a country with a large number of disabled persons. Almost 60 million people have vision, hearing, speech, limb, intellectual or mental disabilities. There is one disabled person in every 20 Chinese, and one out of every five households on average has a disabled family member. According to nationwide surveys of the disabled children under 14 account for 16 percent of the total disabled population, and they display the greatest need for rehabilitative training as they display the highest recovery rates after early treatment. Those disabled between the ages of 15 and 59 account for 44 percent, but often their disabilities are not very serious. Although they are more or less able to work, they require vocational training, cultural education and special employment. The disabled over 60 years of age account for 40 percent. Many of them become disabled due to illness or loss of various functions. Some live alone without any income, and therefore their insurance, rehabilitation, and medical needs have become a social issue. The illiterate and semi-illiterate suffer from limited employment opportunities, and often they become socially disabled as well. These people, often neglected , pose another social problem.

What does Will Gompertz think of Alice Munro?	"Making the announcement, Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, called Alice Munro a ""master of the contemporary short story"". ""She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to live a little bit in the shadow of the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,"" he said. The 82-year-old, whose books include Dear Life and dance of the Happy Shades, is only the 13thwoman to win the Nobel Prize for literature since its start in 1901. ""I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win,"" Munro told Canadian media. Alice Munro: ""I would really hope that this would make people see the short story as an important art form."" Munro, who began writing in her teenage years, published her first story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, in 1950. Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968, was Munro's first collection, and it went on to win Canada's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award. In 2009, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her entire body of work -- but she downplayed her achievements. ""I think maybe I was successful in doing this because I didn't have any other talents,"" she once said in an interview. BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz said Munro had been ""at the very top of her game since she started"". ""Very few writers are her equal,"" he said, adding ""She gets to the heart of what it is to be human"". The award ""probably won't make a commercial difference"" to the author, he added, but it ""makes a huge difference to how her work will be viewed in historical terms"". ""If she hadn't won it before she died, I think it would have been a terrible, terrible omission ."" Often compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town.

How many exchange children did Qing government send to America?	"Many thousands of Chinese are studying at schools in the United States. And writer Liel Leibovitz says the students are following an example that began in the eighteen seventies. Mr. Leibovitz and writer Matthew Miller joined forces to tell the story of the students in their book, ""Fortunate Sons."" The book says China sent one hundred twenty boys from 1872 to 1875 to America to learn about developments that could help modernize their country. Mr. Leibovitz got the idea for the book about the boys a few years ago when he was traveling with his wife in China. Mr. Leibovitz learned that Qing government sent a whole delegation of boys to learn the ways of the West. The goal was for them to return to China and help their country. The book says the boys received their American training in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. It must have been a very good education. Mr. Leibovitz says the first prime minister of the Chinese Republic completed this program. And so did the first engineer to build a large-scale railroad without foreign help. The same was true of the fathers of Chinese education, diplomacy and the Navy. The book-writers had only to open some boxes containing the writings of these men to learn about them. Their notebooks, journals, letters and postcards were in English. Mr. Leibovitz said he was lucky to have so much information from events that took place long ago. The students returned to China after about nine years. They no longer spoke Mandarin well enough to answer questions. Police welcomed them home by putting them in jail. The young men were released after about a week. But they were given low-level jobs. Mr Leibovitz says it took about ten years for them to rise to higher positions. He said their story continues today with large numbers of Chinese studying in the United States."	['120.']
Mount Kilimanjaro is _	Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa and one of the largest free-standing mountains in the world, and some say, the most beautiful place on the earth! The mountain towers 15,000 feet above the plains. Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania and it covers an area of 60 miles long and 40 miles wide. Kilimanjaro is an extinct volcano , with 3 peaks. Kibo is the highest one in the center. Because of Kilimanjaro's great height, the mountain influences its own weather. Winds incoming from the Indian Ocean are stopped upward by the mountain and drop their moisture as rain and snow. People have planted coffee, corn, and other crops on the lower slopes . Mount Kilimanjaro now attracts many thousands of walkers each year. Because of a temperature rise in recent years, the beautiful snow cap of Kilimanjaro is retreating fast. A research said that the white snow on the mountain might be gone in 15 years. What a pity!	['a free-standing mountain']
What would be the best title for this passage?	Popular music in America is what every student likes. Students carry small radios with earphones and listen to music before class, after class, and at lunch. Students with cars buy large speakers and play the music loudly as they drive on the street. Adult drivers listen to music on the car radio as they drive to work. They also listen to the news about sports, the weather, and the life of American people. Most of the radio programmers are music. Pop or popular music singers make much money. They make a CD or a tape which radio stations use in many places. Once the popular singer is heard all over the country, young people buy his or her tape. Some of the money from these tapes goes to the singer. Wherever the singer goes, all the young people want to meet him or her. Now the singer has become a national star. There are other kinds of music that are important to Americans. One is called folk music. It tells stories about the common life of Americans. Another is western or country music. This was started by cowboys who would sing at night to the cows they were watching. Today, any music about country life and the 1ove between a country boy and his girl is called western or country music. ,.	['American Music.']
What might be the author's purpose in writing the passage?	Forty years ago, Finland was a small country with ordinary public schools. Today, Finland is still small but no one calls Finland's public schools ordinary anymore. In 2000, the Finns surprised the world when their 15yearolds scored at the top of a closelywatched international exam called the PISA, the Program for International Student Assessment. Finland has stayed near the top ever since, while the US scores around the middle. Pasi Sahlberg, an official of Finland's Ministry of Education and Culture, is in Seattle this week to share the story of Finland's success, and what states like Washington can learn from it. Sahlberg's message, although he is too polite to put it so directly: Stop testing so much. Trust teachers more. Give less homework. Shorten the school day. On Tuesday, in a room filled with teachers, principals, professors, schoolboard members and policy makers, Sahlberg joked about the Finns' reputation for being a quiet, humble people. When Finland hit the top of the PISA, he said, the biggest disbelievers were Finns. More seriously, he said, Finland never set out to create the world's top school system. Instead, he said, the country decided in the 1970s that it wanted to ensure that a student's success didn't depend on family background. To achieve that goal, Finland relied on cooperation among teachers and schools, rather than on competition. Rather than judges teachers and schools based on test scores, he said, Finland puts trust in its teachers and principals. Teachers develop the curriculum in Finland, and design their own tests. There are no national tests, except one at the end of high school. That's just the start. Along with a shorter school day, Finnish students don't even start school until they are 7 years old. Many primary schools have a policy against giving homework. But Finland, he said, succeeded in part by adapting ideas from the US and other countries. And those countries, he said, can learn from Finland, too.	"[""To share the story of Finland's success in education.""]"

There are both Vitamins A and D in _ .	The vitamins are named by letters of the alphabet . Vitamin A is needed by the eyes. There is Vitamin A in milk, butter, and green vegetables. It can be kept by the body. Vitamin B cannot be kept. It must be supplied all the time by some of the food we eat. Vitamin C is very important to the body. Without it men's teeth become loose and their arms and legs get weak. Lemons , oranges and tomatoes have Vitamin C in them. Vitamin D is the sun vitamin. We get it in milk and eggs and from sunlight on our skin . There are other Vitamins, but these A, B, C and D, are the most important.	['milk']
For what purpose does the author write the passage?	What can you say about a vibrant city that I once called home? Is she beautiful or brilliant? Do these lines sound familiar to you? If you have read the book or seen the movie 'Love Story' you would know that my opening lines are 'inspired' from it. And it fits! I fell in love with Hong Kong at first sight! It's the city where I set up our first home, raised our son, and studied my MBA. Our first encounter was in October 2010, when my husband and I were there for a week to visit the city we would be calling home for the next few years. Once we entered the city, what impressed us was its vibrancy and almost immediately I was convinced to make that city our home. A few months later, we settled down and I loved everything about Hong Kong! The wet markets, the modern shopping malls, the bargaining at Mongkok, the fine foods...there is so much to experience. Then came the MBA, which took the entire experience to a different level. I was so nervous about returning to books after almost a decade. I thought I would struggle a lot with the academic requirements. But, I made it. I am so happy to have so many good memories to write in this blog. One thing for which I will always be grateful is the opportunity to travel. And Hong Kong gave me plenty of that. I feel enriched just having visited some of the neighboring countries. I am living in another city that I love----London now. However, Hong Kong, for all its sights and smells, was once home to me and my family. I WILL MISS YOU!

How many times did the two crows argue?	"Once there were two crows whose opinions were always opposite. One day, one of the crows said to the other, "" You should realize, of course, that I can fly much higher than you."" "" Don't be ridiculous ."" the other crow said. "" Everyone knows that I can fly much higher than you."" ""No, you can't"" the first crow said. ""Yes, I can"" the second crow replied, and the argument went on and on. At last they decided to have a contest to solve the argument. "" We will compete to find out who can fly higher while carrying a bag"" the first crow said. They argued for some time because of the size of the bag, but at last _ . Then there was a further argument about what each bag would be filled with. Finally, they agreed that the first crow would fill his bag with cotton and the second crow would fill his with salt. The first crow thought he was clever to agree to this, because salt is much heavier than cotton. At last they were ready for the contest. Holding their bag in their mouths, they flew into the sky. They had not been flying for long. However, when it began to rain- as the second crow had expected it would. Can you guess who could fly higher?"	['Three times']
The writer will not agree that _ .	"A peer is a person who is about the same age as you. Peers affect your life, whether you know it or not, just by spending time with you. Peers can have a good effect on one another. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book and now everyone's reading it. However, sometimes peers affect one another in another way. For example, one kid in school might try to get another to cut class with him, your soccer friend might try to persuade you to be mean to another player and never pass her the ball, or a kid in the neighborhood might want you to with him. Some kids give in to peer pressure because they want to be liked, to fit in, or because they worry that other kids may make fun of them if they don't go along with the group. Others may go along because they are curious to try something new that others are doing. The idea that "" everyone's doing it"" may influence some kids to leave their better judgments or their common senses behind. Peer pressure can be extremely strong and hard to get rid of. Experiments have shown how peer pressure can influence someone to change her/ his mind from what she/ he knows for sure is a correct answer to the incorrect answer----just because everyone else gives the incorrect answer! That holds true for people of any age in peer pressure situations. It can be hard to walk away from peer pressure, but it can be done. Paying attention to your own feelings and beliefs about what is right and wrong can help you know the right thing to do. Inner strength and self- confidence can help you stand firm, walk away and resist doing something when you know better."

Which can best describe Dylan's mom's attitude towards life today?	"To the mom I used to be: Two years ago, you were happy and whole. You had a plan for life -- start a new business, get involved in the Parent-teacher Association, teach your sons how to ride bicycles, spend as much time with your friends and parents as possible, watch your children mature and grow old with your husband. You were a "" _ "" person who often felt so much joy. You always looked forward, smiled and danced. Two years ago, on December 14, 2012, the world changed and you changed with it. Disturbed young men with access to high-powered guns went to your sons' school and killed six educators and twenty first-graders. Your eldest son Jake survived, but was changed by the day he discovered some monsters are real. He describes it as the day ""when evils came to my school."" Your youngest son, Dylan, whom you thought of as a pure love, with his charming eyes and infectious giggle ,was killed. Shot multiple times, he died instantly in the arms of his special-education assistant who also died while trying to protect him. The tragedy changed all your life, not only because of losing your child, but because of the hole inside you that can never be filled. Your eldest son has been forced to grow up too fast because of the loss of his brother. The pain has altered the lines on your husband's face. The way you look at the world has changed. Your interactions with friends and family seem foreign. ... ... But the things have moved on with hopefulness. You are now someone far more realistic. You control your feelings because you fear if you really let it out, you would never recover. It would destroy you. You know what you should do is try everything to protect more children. You're fighting a good fight, what the whole society really needs. With love, Nicole Hockley, Dylan's mom"	['Positive.']

The author enjoys playing on the stage so as to _ .	"Childhood was an illusion and the illusion was this: everything was bigger. No, I mean everything, not just houses and shops and grown-ups, but colors and flowers and journeys, especially journeys which seemed endless. ""Are we there yet, Daddy?"" Funfairs were huge things that spread for miles around you with noise and lights and exciting danger. Rainy days at home when you were ill seemed to last for ever. Being a grown-up yourself was an unthinkable distant possibility. Every sound was louder, every game was grander, every pain unbearable. As I've grown old, life has become smaller. Tastes have dulled. Surprises have turned into shocks. Days go by unnoticed. How can I regain childhood when it was an illusion? I have only one repeatable and wonderful way and even in this way I can regain only part of that larger world. I can play upon the stage like a child and make the crowd laugh and laugh with them, sometimes helplessly like a child, and then, even though I'm a sixty-one-year-old man, I can almost catch the colors and sounds and stillness of those bigger years when I was little."

The main idea of this passage is _	Every day we go to school and listen to teachers, and the teacher will ask us some questions. Sometimes,the classmates will ask your opinions of the work of the class. When you are telling others in the class what you have found out about these topics, remember that they must be able to hear what you are saying. You are not taking part in a family conversation or having a chat with friends--you are in a situation where a large group of people will remain silent, waiting to hear what you have to say. You must speak so that they can hear you loudly enough and clearly enough but without trying to shout or appearing to force yourself. Remember, too, that it is the same if you are called to an interview whether it is with a professor of your school or a government official who might meet you. The person you are seeing will try to put you at your ease ordinary conversation but the situation is somewhat different from that of an ordinary conversation. You must take special care that you can he heard.	['that we must use different ways at different situations']
According to the passage, the 20s is an age for people to _ .	"Ask a group of elderly people what it was about their lives that made them happiest overall, and they'll probably mention some warm relationships with family and friends. If you're satisfied with your social life, according to psychologists, you tend to be satisfied with life in general. From the point of my 50s, I'd say that sounds about right. Some of my happiest moments are the ones I spend with my husband, a few close relatives, and a handful of very good friends who know me well and like me anyway. But the more I read about how social media are interfering with good old-fashioned friendship, creating virtual bonds that can't quite take the place of real ones, the more I wonder just how today's 20-somethings will look back on their own lives when they're my age. After all, much crucial relationship building work is done in the 20s. According to research by the late Bernice Neugarten of the University of Chicago, who helped launch the academic study of human development, people choose most of their adult relationships, both friends and lovers, between the ages of 22 and 28. The friends we make in our 20s are not only best friends forever; they're also our first truly chosen friends. And choosing how to commit to these friendships is an essential psychological task of the 20s. But with so much of friendship in this age group now being developed online, an essential question is what the effect of that interaction is. A study, conducted in 2010 by Craig Watkins and Erin Lee of the University of Texas at Austin, investigated the Facebook habits of 776 young people between the ages of 18 and 35. ""Whether it is a wall post, a comment, or a photo,"" they wrote, ""young people's engagement with Facebook is driven, primarily, by a desire to stay connected to and involved in the lives of friends who live close by, far away, or have just entered into their lives."" This kind of constant contact can be efficient, but it can also be upsetting. For one thing, it adds a new layer of concern to a young person's already-heightened awareness of social ranking, giving appearance-conscious young people yet another thing to worry about. ""I see other 20-somethings feeling pressured to constantly keep up a public image, especially a public image online,"" wrote Ariana Allensworth on the group blog. ""Folks are always keeping the world informed one way or another about what they're up to, where they're at, what projects they're working on. It can be a bit much at times."" Not the most fertile ground for real-world friendship."	['develop critical relationships']
Which of the following things is /are harmful according to the passage?	"As a result of pollution, Lake Erie, on the borders of the USA and Canada, is now without many living things. Pollution in water is not simply a matter of ""poisons"" killing large numbers of fish overnight. Very often the effects of pollution are not noticed for many months or years because the first organisms to be affected are either plants or plankton . These organisms are the food of fish, birds, and other creatures. When this food disappears, the fish and birds die too. In this way a whole food chain can be wiped out, and it is not until dead fish and water birds are seen at the river's edge or on the sea shore that people realize what is happening. Where do the substances which pollute water come from? There are two main sources, sewage and industrial waste. As more detergent is used in homes, more of it is finally put into our rivers, lakes and seas. Detergents harm water birds by breaking down the natural substances which keep their feathers _ Sewage itself, if not properly treated, makes the water dirty and prevents all forms of life in rivers and the sea from receiving the oxygen they need. Industrial waste is even more harmful since there are many highly poisonous materials in it, such as copper and lead. So if we want to stop this pollution, the answer is simple. Sewage and industrial waste must be made clean before flowing into the water reservoirs. It may already be too late to save some rivers and lakes, but others can still be saved if the correct action is taken at once."	['Industrial waste and chemicals']
Why does David E. Levy keep his door half open?	"Finding time to enjoy life is becoming harder and harder. As the average workweek lengthens, leisure time drops. Yet some of the world's busiest people are able to develop rewarding careers and also make time for family and leisure activities. Here is their best advice plus that of time-management experts: 1. Use your peak hours wisely. People tend to be most alert in late morning and midevening. Afternoon brings an increase in sleepiness. Use your high-efficiency hours to handle difficult jobs or engage in creative thinking. For low-efficiency times, concentrate on cleaning up or sorting your mail. By adapting to your mental condition, you can accomplish more in less time. 2. Make a plan. Just 20 minutes of organizing can save an hour of extra effort remembering what must be done. ""Don't try to carry your life around in your head,"" says Lucy Hedrick, author of Five Days to an Organized Life. ""Write things down so you can free your brain for more inventive pursuit ."" 3. Discourage drop-ins. The person who welcomes every visitor will get plenty of conversation but won't accomplish much. The trick is to develop harmless ways to protect yourself from minute-stealing interruptions. David E. Levy, a public-relations consultant , uses an alternative to the open-door policy by keeping his door half open. The message is clear: he really doesn't want you to come in, but you can if it is important. 4. Tame the telephone. Few devices save more minutes--or waste so many more--than the telephone. Signal the end of your conversation with a phrase such as ""Before we hang up..."" You can save even more time by not taking every incoming call. Keep a record of when people you call regularly are least busy and call them at those times. Even better, make appointments to call important contacts. To help us gain an extra hour every day, a clockmaker in Dallas has created a timer measuring each minute at 57.6 seconds. The 2.5 seconds borrowed from each minute add up to an extra 60 minutes at the end of each day."	['To keep unimportant visitors from dropping in.']
What problem do teachers face in the author's opinion?	"Some parents say summer is the time when teachers should get more pay.But not everyone is grateful to teachers for keeping kids occupied between June and August--Washington state representative Liz Pike has written a Face book post and responded to teachers' complaints of rising cost of living.After reading her post,I feel that Liz Pike should rethink her criticism of public school teaching and avoid comparing it to the private sector. Many of us teachers would certainly like teaching to be more like the private school.It's nothing wrong with fair pay for fair performance.With standardized testing popular throughout the education, teachers are some of the most analyzed and performance-measured employees in the United Sates. Liz Pike is very angry that teachers want raises even while test scores are dropping.Well,how are they supposed to have discipline in the classroom when our hands are tied and we can hardly do anything with naughty students? Teachers would love to be able to turn education around and improve student performance.,However, unlike private school businesses.public schools cannot turn away ""customers"".A private school business serves customers who walk through the door of their own free will,while public schools have to educate students who only attend school because laws say they must. She says those teachers who are uninspired by a lack of a cost of living increases should give up teaching.Is this the message that she thinks should be sent to the students whose academic performance she claims to care so much about? I think supporting teachers can make teachers teach children how to stand up for themselves."	['Popular standardized tests and their tied hands.']
"Why were toy bears named ""Teddy""?"	"The early 1900s were very different from today, when toys were still the delight of children everywhere. Theodore Roosevelt's Presidency marks the beginning of the ""Teddy Bear"". In the year 1902,toy bears were named ""Teddy"" after the president's nickname. The Teddy Bear became known worldwide and it was only a few years later that the Teddy Bears were mass produced. In 1913,an item called the Erector Set was invented. It was a steel,motorized toy that children could use to build models of anything. Its creator was A.C.Gilbert,a medical doctor. Charles Pajeau created a similar wooden set called Tinker Toys in the year 1914.Tinker Toys were made for younger children. Raggedy Ann dolls first came on the scene after newspaper cartoonist Johnny Gruelle reproduced the doll he made for his daughter. That was in 1915. The following year,an architect's son named John Lloyd Wright,invented Lincoln Logs,which were interlocked to make structures. Two years after Mickey Mouse was created,stuffed Mickey Mouse dolls were made by Charlotte Clark. This was the start of Disney merchandise. The yoyo became popular in the United States after Donald Duncan bought a yoyo company in 1929. The ViewMaster,a three dimensional viewer,was developed by a camera enthusiast named William Gruber. The toy became popular when Gruber licensed Disney characters to make still, 3D images from Disney movies and television programs. Finally,in 1940,model airplanes were mass produced. They started out as a way for manufacturers to sell planes to the military,but later caught on as a toy. The toys that we know and love today have had their roots from these ancient times. Thanks to all these creative man's efforts, we know otherwise what we may never know."	['To memorize President Theodore Roosevelt']
How old was he when he moved to Paris and how old was he when he died?	"Pablo Picasso was born in Spain in 1881.His father was a painter and art teacher who gave his son the first lesson in drawing.He won a prize--""Science and Charity"" for his first important painting when he was only fifteen.He studied in several cities in Spain.But there was no one to teach him all that he wanted to know.When he was nineteen,he visited Paris. Paris was then the center of the world for artists.Everything that was new and exciting in the world of paintings seemed to happen there.When he was twenty-three,Picasso moved there to live and lived in France for the rest of his life. When he was over ninety,this great painter still lived his life like a young man.He was still looking for new ideas and new ways to use his artistic materials. When he died in 1973,he was ninety-one years old. ,."	['Twenty-three and ninety-one.']
What's the best title for the passage?	"Have you ever dreamed of visiting a planet in the Milky Way? While the trip sounds exciting, it would take years and years to reach the place that we are going to. So in the future, bedtime for astronauts may be more than a few hours of regular shut-eye. They would have to sleep for years. European researchers are now doing hibernation experiments. The study may help them understand whether humans could ever sleep through the years it would take for a space flight to distant planets. ""If there was an effective technology, it could make deep-space travel come true,"" said Mark Ayer of the European Space Agency last month. What seems like science fiction is not completely impossible. Researchers have been able to use chemicals to put living cells into a sleep-like state where they don't age. They have now moved on to small, non-hibernating mammals like rats. The results will be out soon. A major challenge is the fact that cells can be very simple systems, but body organs are far more complex . ""It's like moving from a simple Apple computer to a supercomputer,"" said Marco Biggiogera, a hibernation researcher at Italy's University of Pavia. Just like bears and frogs, the hibernation of human beings would cause a person's metabolism to lower so they would need less energy. Medical research, however, is just half of a space flight hibernation system. There is the challenge of designing a suitable protective place to live. Such a place would provide the proper environment for hibernation, such as the proper temperature. It would also have to monitor life functions and serve the physiological needs of the hibernator. According to Ayer, the six-person Human Outer Planets Exploration Mission to Jupiter's moon Callisto, could be an opportunity to use human hibernation. The mission aims to send six humans on a five-year flight to Callisto, where they will spend 30 days, in 2045. , ."	['Hibernation study for space travel']

We may infer from the passage that _ .	There is much discussion today about whether economic growth is desirable. At an earlier period, our desire for material wealth may have been justified. Now, however, this desire for more than we need is causing serious problems. Even though we have good intentions, we may be producing too much, too fast. Those who criticize economic growth argue that we must slow down. They believe that society is approaching certain limits on growth. These include the fixed supply of natural resources, the possible negative effects of industry on the natural environment, and the continuing increase in the world's population. As society reaches these limits, economic growth can no longer continue, and the quality of life will decrease. People who want more economic growth, on the other hand, argue that even at the present growth rate there are still many poor people in the world. These proponents of economic growth believe that only more growth can create the capital needed to improve the quality of life in the world. Furthermore, they argue that only continued growth can provide the financial resources required to protect our natural surroundings from industrialization. This debate over the desirability of continued economic growth is of vital importance to business and industry. If those who argue against economic growth are correct, the problems they mention cannot be ignored. To find a solution, economists and business community must pay attention to these problems and discuss them with one another.	['the author describes the case as it is']
What can we learn about the robot players?	The end of the 2014 World Cup does not mean the end of the international competition in Brazil. A major football event which is known as RoboCup will be held in the coastal city Joao Pessoa. Teams of robots from around the world will take part in _ and play the game known as soccer in the United States. The robot teams are guided by teams of human beings. Watching robots play football is similar to watching children play the game. The kicks are not good, there are a lot of falls , and people are there to guide and support the robot players. Students of the University of Pennsylvania are trying for their fourth victory at the competition. The students have won the last three RoboCup competition in the Netherlands, Mexico and Turkey. Jian Qiaoli is one of the leaders of the University of Pennsylvania team. He says one goal he has set for his team is to make sure the robots can find the ball and know where they are on the playing field. And he wants the team to be able to better control the walking ability of the robots. They should pay more attention to the kicking ability, which is the key to winning the game. Qin He is another leader of the robot team. She says the abilities of the robots improve every year. The robots know the difference between the colors green and red, and they can decide where to go and where the ball is on the playing field. She says the robots are self-learning and don't need to be told what to do. If there are three robot players on the playing field at the same time, they will communicate with each other to decide different responsibility for each of them. They have very good team play right now. As long as the radar detection works well, the robots will be very competitive. So RoboCup will be an exciting technology competition.

According to the passage, in the future cars will be _ .	"It's exciting to imagine how future humans will have solved the problems we have now, or what amazing new inventions will make our lives more convenient and interesting. We asked top scientists to share their predictions on what the world will be like in a century. If they're right, the 2114 is going to be really cool. 1. Robots will do your chores and more Robots will be doing most of our jobs, from building homes to teaching math. There are already robots that clean floors and pump gas. In the future they will be more complicated and useful. Unfortunately, with robots taking all the jobs, unemployment will be high. 2. You will read minds. Speaking of being social, we will communicate in an entirely different way. Forget texts and emails. Mind-reading technology will allow us to send thoughts to each other without speaking a word. We will also be able to send thoughts to objects around us. (Instead of pressing ""start"" on the microwave, you could just think ""start."") Meanwhile, chips implanted(in our brains will improve memory and intelligence. 3. Your car will drive you Today, around 30,000 Americans die in car accidents each year. One hundred years form now, accidents will be a thing of the past. According to Mark Safford, consultant or the U.S. Department of Transportation, future cars will drive themselves. These electric cars will communicate with other cars on the road to travel safely in close formation at high speeds. 4. You will eat fake meat. Raising animals is not an efficient way to produce food, and it harms the environment: Cows, chickens, and pigs eat a lot, and then we have to deal with all that poop(. What's more, that poop can up poisoning lakes, rivers, and streams. Today, scientists can ""grow"" meat in a lab from animal cells, but it's expensive and not very delicious. In the future, they will have perfected the process. You'll order hamburgers that come from factories, not cows. Scientists may even find ways to make lab-grown meat tastier and healthier than the real thing."	['much easier to operate']

The best title of the passage will probably be _ .	"Mary Buendia once spent a day in an airplane, looking for a cat. She didn't find it that day. The plane flew around all over the world for three weeks with the cat on board. She finally found it in the cargo hold and sent it home first-class. Another time ,she found two suitcases full of birds from Turkey. But her strangest experience was when she pulled a snake out of a man's pants. Mary Buendia is an animal health inspector at JFK Airport in New York. She takes care of all the animals that pass through the airport and checks that they are healthy. In the Animal Health Center, there are areas for dogs, cats, reptiles, birds, and fish. There is also an area for very big animals. The biggest they ever had was a black rhino. ""It was no problem."" she says. At the center, they receive all types of animals monkeys, wild cats, poisonous spiders. It's impossible for one person to know about all of these, but there are 20 people working with Mary. Among them, they understand how to take care of the animals. She recently had to feed a group of toucans, which are rare birds. ""luckily,"" she says, ""there is a supermarket nearby which is open 24 hours. I had to go at 2 a.m to buy bananas. Mary often works at night. ""It's quiet between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m."" she says, ""because we don't have night flights. We try to give the animals a quiet night."" Mary clearly loves her job. ""You never know what the day will bring,""she says, and goes off to feed the birds."	['Airport Health Inspector']
What is the finding of the study?	"Fear may be felt in the heart as well as in the head, according to a study that has found a link between the cycles of a beating heart and the chance of someone feeling fear. Tests on healthy volunteers found that they were more likely to feel a sense of fear at the moment when their hearts are contracting and pumping blood around their bodies, compared with the point when the heartbeat is relaxed. Scientists say the results suggest that the heart is able to influence how the brain responds to a fearful event, depending on which point it is at in its regular cycle of contraction and relaxation. Sarah Garfinkel at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School said: ""Our study shows for the first time that the way in which we deal with fear is different depending on when we see fearful pictures in relation to our heart."" The study tested 20 healthy volunteers on their reactions to fear as they were shown pictures of fearful faces. Dr Garfinkel said, ""The study showed that fearful faces are better noticed when the heart is pumping than when it is relaxed. Thus our hearts can also affect what we see and what we don't see - and guide whether we see fear."" To further understand this relationship, the scientists also used a brain scanner to show how the brain influences the way the heart changes a person's feeling of fear. ""We have found an important _ by which the heart and brain 'speak'to each other to change our feelings and reduce fear,"" Dr Garfinkel said. ""We hope that by increasing our understanding about how fear is dealt with and ways that it could be reduced, we may be able to develop more successful treatments for anxiety disorders, and also for those for those who may be suffering from serious stress disorder."""	"[""One's heart affects how he feels fear.""]"
What is the passage mainly talking about?	A couple of years ago, those who forecast that oil price would reach $ 100 a barrel were seen as doomsters. However, now some are predicting $ 200 a barrel. Had economists been told that oil price would barely pause at $ 100 before reaching the recent peak of nearly $ 127, they would no doubt have forecast terrible economic consequences. But the global economy, though interrupted by the high price of energy, is still chugging along. Meanwhile, inflation has picked up, but the headlinerates of inflation in most developed countries are nowhere near the levels seen in the 1970s and 1980s. There are three explanations for the oil price's unclear impact. The first is that nowadays developed economies are more efficient in their use of energy, thanks partly to the increased importance of service industries and the diminished role of manufacturing . According to the Energy Information Administration, the energy intensity of America's GDP fell by 42% between 1980 and 2007. A second theory is that the oil-price rise has been steady, not sudden, giving the economy time to adjust. Giovanni Serio of Goldman Sachs points out that in 1973 there was a severe supply shock because of the oil embargo , when the world had to cope with 10%-15% less crude almost overnight. Not this time. The third explanation turns the argument on its head; rather than oil harming the global economy, it is global expansion that is driving up the price of oil. The most important factor is the shift in favor of the developing economies. America has responded to high price in familiar fashion: UBS forecasts that demand will drop by 1.1% this year and will be no higher in 2010 than it was in 2004. But the demand from China and other emerging markets is more than offsetting this shortfall.	['The increase of oil price']
Which of the following can be inferred from the passage?	"He leant down to the pickpocket The heaving and gasping had stopped, but he was still making a show of his breathlessness. ""That's better,"" Mallon said. ""Can you stand up? Try to stand up. Here."" he said, and gripped the pickpocket's arm and forced him upright until he saw his face for the first time. As the pickpocket labored for breath, he gazed up at Mallon with his dark eyes. ""How could you?"" they asked. Mallon might have said, ""Because you tried to steal from me."" But he was still conscious of the flush of joy he'd felt when his blow struck home-when he knew he'd hurt the man. Where that joy came from he couldn't say, but he knew that its roots were deeper than some clumsy failed theft. Fat drops of rain began to patter on the awning . ""How are you?"" Mallon said. ""Can you walk?"" The pickpocket turned away and leant against the store window with both hands, and his head sank lower as his shoulders rose and fell. A gray-haired woman inside the store rapped on the glass and made a shooing motion. When the pickpocket ignored het she rapped harder and kept rapping. ""I have to go,"" Mallon said. ""I'm sorry."" He looked up at the sky. ""I'm sorry,"" he said again, and stepped into the rain and walked quickly up the street. One of the Bangladeshi umbrella sellers was working the comer, and Mallon had just paid seven euros when he heard a woman shouting. He didn't want to look back but did. It was the woman from the shop. pushing and batting the pickpocket away from the window while he bent down and covered his head like a boxer trying to get through the 1ast seconds of a round. Mallon slipped his wallet back into his jacket pocket and took the umbrella that the Bangladeshi had opened for him. The pickpocket was out on the sidewalk now, in the rain. The woman stood just under the awning with her arms crossed over her chest. ""Excuse me, madam,"" Mallon said, coming up to them. ""This man isn't well. He needs to rest a moment. '' ""I know these people."" she said. ""Our Romans don't want them here."" The rain fell in sheets, ran down the pickpocket's shiny scalp and face, down his 1eather jacket. ""Here."" Mallon said, and offered him the umbrella, but he only looked at Mallon with his hurt dark eyes and then lowered his head again Mallon bumped him in the shoulder with the handle of the umbrella ""Go on-take it!"" he said. And finally, with a beaten. unwilling look, the pickpocket did. And that was when he saw a taxi round the corner with a 1ight glowing on its roof. Mallon ran out waving his arm and the cab turned sharply to the pavement, sending a lot of water over his shoes. He opened the door but couldn't help looking back. The pickpocket had lowered the umbrella to the ground upside down and was 1caning on the shaft, head low, neck bared to the sky. ""Wait,'' Mallon said to the driver. He went back and grabbed the pickpocket's sleeve and pulled him to the cab. ""Get in,"" Mallon said, and took the umbrella and pushed him into the back seat. He leaned inside. ""O. K., where do you live?"" ''No Gypsies!"" the driver said. He was twisted around, glaring at the pickpocket. ""Gypsy? Look, he's not well. I'll pay,"" Mallon added The driver shook his head. ""No Gypsies. Get him out. "" Mallon 1ooked at the driver's nameplate: Michele Kadare. ""It's the law,"" he said, ""If you don't take us. Signor Kadare. I'll report you and you'll lose your license. Believe me-I am quite serious. The driver fastened those pale eyes on Mallon and turned and put his hands on the steering wheel. He raised his eyes to the rearview mirror and he and Mallon exchanged stares. ""O. K., Mr. American."" he said. ""You pay. """	"[""The pickpocket had conflicting emotions about Mallon's help.""]"
Which of the following is true according to the passage?	"Robots have come a long way since 15th century. We've got robots to build cars, carry heavy things, work in dangerous places and explore planets. But things haven't stopped there. In 1986, Honda made a robot called ASIMO. And now, it has been developed greatly. Standing at 130cm and weighing 54kg. ASIMO is very much like a small astronaut wearing a bag on the back. And he can walk, flight, climb and run fast. Isn't it wonderful? The world's first robot teacher is Saya. With her human-like face, she can show expressions like happiness, surprise, sadness, dislike, fear and she can even smile or show anger at students, which look much like a real teacher's. To do this, her rubber skin is pulled from the back with motors inside. And her eyes and mouth have wires too. She can also say some simple words like ""hello"" or ""thank you"". In the UK, the development of robots is exciting. The mini-robots will send food, clean floors, collect and throw away waste.

This passage is probably written for _ .	You want to know where the safest place for young children is in the car? For a child of any age, the back seat is the safest place and the safest part of the back seat is the middle. In the back seat, the child is farthest away from the force or effect of head-on collision , which can cause the most injuries. All fifty states of theprefix = st1 /USAhave laws requiring the use of safety seats for young children. If you have children under 8 years of age weighing no more than 80 pounds, it is necessary to fit your car with a special child safety seat. The child safety seat comes in three types or sizes: the first type is designed for babies from birth to one year of age, until the baby weighs about 20 pounds; the second size is for children between one and four years of age, who weigh between 20 and 40 pounds; the third kind is used by older children big enough to use the car's belt system. Moreover, all these safety seats must be fitted and held in place on the car's back seat. If your child does need your attention while you are driving, don't look back. Just pull over . In addition, always be sure your child is properly fastened throughout the entire trip. Children who can unfasten their own car seats are subject to fatal injuries in an accident. Start early in your child's life teaching them that car safety is serious business and make sure you give a good example and always wear your own seat belt.	['parents of small children']

Which of the following can communicate the feeling a loved one perfectly?	While many modern forms of communication like phone calls, e-mail, and letters, are extremely convenient. In my opinion, nothing beats speaking to another person face to face. The first and most obvious advantage that a face communication has over a letter and e-mail is that there is the ability to interactively converse. If the sender of a letter or an email does not write clearly, then much time must be spent to clear up the misunderstanding. In a face-to-face conversation, misunderstandings are easily dealt with because of the interactive nature of it. I would still argue that the face-to-face conversation is better because you can see the other person. Not all communication is verbal ; the meaning of much of what we say depends on our body language and the tone of voice. Joking and irony are particularly difficult to express and enjoy without seeing the expression on someone's face, or watching the movements of their body. Finally, if the goal of communication is to maintain or deepen the relationship with someone, the face-to-face communication offers the choice of communication by touch even if we could communicate by the video. Trust and respect between business partners can be established with a firm handshake. No amount of body language can convey the excitement of a high five between friends, and no number of words can communicate the comforting embrace of a loved one. Touch is the first basic method of our human relationships, before spoken language, and it is only available when people communicate face to face.	['face to face communication']
Steve will ride 900 miles in 9 days to _ .	Steve Sparks was a young successful lawyer when a bruise on one of the legs of his 3-year-old daughter changed his life. The bruise led to a doctor's visit. The doctor said his daughter was suffering from leukemia . Steve said that in a moment his life changed from what restaurant he was going to take his clients to lunch to whether his daughter Katie was ever going to see her fourth birthday. For three years Katie received a lot of treatment at the Nemours Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Delaware and with the help of wonderful doctors, kind nurses, whom Steve and his wife Michelle called heroes, Katie's leukemia was cured . Forever changed by the experience and encouraged by the heroes at Nemours who saved his daughter's life, Steve felt he couldn't go back to business as usual. He felt there was something else he was meant to do and that something else led him to join the Nemours Foundation at the age of 28. The job change came with a 65% pay cut from what he was making as a lawyer, but Steve thought he was right and it was more important to help those who need help. Steve is glad to have made such a choice. Katie is now a healthy 20-year-old college student and Steve is one of the leaders of the Nemours Foundation. In three weeks Steve will have a party for Katie's 21st birthday, and give big thanks to the Nemours by riding his bicycle from Nemours in Jack-sonville, Florida to Wilmington, Delaware. He'll ride 900 miles in 9 days and raise $100,000 for the Nemours Foundation with the hope of saving more children's lives.	"[""raise money to save more children's lives""]"
How many dollars did young Ford earn every week? _ .	"The car was invented just a century ago. You may know all kinds of cars' names, but many people don't know who was the inventor of the first car. The first car was invented not by a German, but by an American. His name was Henry Ford. Henry was born in a poor family. He was the eldest of six children. When he was a boy, he became interested in mending watches and machines. When he was twelve years old, his mother died. Soon he had to work in a machine shop for two dollars and fifty cents a week. In the evenings he repaired watches for another dollar a week. The hard life made him strong and able. At that time there was another interest in the life of the young ford. He dreamed to make a machine. It could run without a horse, so named ""horseless carriage."" He over-came a lot of difficulties and in April 1893, the ""horseless carriage"" was finally finished. It was the first car. Later Henry Ford founded the Ford Motor Company . He was really the first inventor of the car in the world."	['3.5 dollars']
What is one of the most important meals of the day?	I think all of us should know it's necessary to have breakfast. It's one of the most important meals of the day. If you want to keep fit, you should have a good breakfast. Choosing the right food is also important. For it, you may have bread, eggs and milk. But in fact, many students go to school without breakfast. This does harm to their health. Maybe they say they have no time because it's too late or their parents are too busy to prepare breakfast for them. What will happen to the students on an empty stomach ? Because of no energy, they can't keep active. They may not grow fast. When they feel hungry, they are not able to study well and they have no energy to play well, either. What's worse , they will spend more time getting better once they fall ill. Therefore , we shouldn't go to school without breakfast, no matter what reason it is.	['Breakfast.']
Which of the following statements is true?	"STOCKHOLM, Oct.11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese writer Mo Yan has won the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, announced Peter Englund, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on Thursday. The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 is awarded to Chinese writer Mo Yan ""who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary,"" said Englund at a press conference. Mo Yan, a pseudonym for Guan Moye, was born in 1955 and grew up in Gaomi in Shandong province in eastern China.His parents were farmers. As a 12-year-old during the Cultural Revolution he left school to work, first in agriculture, later in a factory.In 1976 he joined the People's Liberation Army and during this time began to study literature and write.His first short story was published in a literary journal in 1981. ""In his writing, Mo Yan draws on his youthful experiences and on settings in the province of his birth.This is apparent in his novel Hong gaoliang jiazu (1987, in English Red Sorghum 1993),"" said the academy in a statement of Mo's biography. The book consists of five stories that unfold and interweave in Gaomi in several turbulent decades in the 20th century, with depictions of bandit culture, the Japanese occupation and the harsh conditions endured by poor farm workers, according to the biography.Red Sorghum was successfully filmed in 1987, directed by famous Chinese director Zhang Yimou. Through a mixture of fantasy and reality, historical and social perspectives, Mo Yan has created a world reminiscent in its complexity of those in the writings of William Faulkner and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, at the same time finding a departure point in old Chinese literature and in oral tradition, the academy commented in the biographical statement. In addition to his novels, Mo Yan has published many short stories and essays on various topics.In spite of his social criticism, he is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, the statement added. Dozens of his works have been translated into English, French and Japanese and many other languages. Last year's literature prize went to Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer. Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist who invented dynamite, established the Nobel Prizes in his will in 1895.The first awards were handed out six years later."

The place should have a lot of air. This will keep some insects away. High land with water on both sides of it is good. Then we put up our tent. We put everything into the tent, and we are ready for fun. We can swim in the lake, walk in the woods, climb a mountain, row a boat, or go fishing. In the evening we come back to the tent, we build a big fire because it can keep the insects away. We sit around the fire and talk. We may tell interesting stories or we may sing songs. At night we lie down on the grass. We can look up at the stars. It is a busy day, so we try to go to sleep early. Everything is dark. Everything is quiet.

According to the passage, reading can help people in many ways EXCEPT _ .	"Reading is very important. World Book Day falls on April 23 every year. It encourages people, especially teenagers, to discover the pleasure of reading. It is also the day to honor great writers. Many countries celebrate World Book Day. On that day, millions of school children can buy books at a much lower price than usual in any bookstore in England. It has been done every year since 1998. World Book Day is also celebrated in China. Wen Jiabao, Premier of China, is an avid reader. He does lots of reading every day though he is very busy. On World Book Day 2009, he called on people to do more reading. Wen suggested that young people should spend more time reading. ""Books can not change the world, but people can change the world by changing themselves through reading,"" he said. Reading helps us become more knowledgeable and smarter. Reading helps us to follow the latest developments of science and technology . Reading gives us information about other cultures and places in the world. Reading is also one of the most important ways to learn a foreign language like English. We all know that it is difficult to learn everything in the classroom, for example, the ways English people are living and working today can be learnt by reading.

What would be the best title for the passage?	"A growing number of college students are applying to take entry tests for medical and dental schools among increasing graduate unemployment in Korea. ""I've decided to apply for the test to enter a medical college to become a doctor, changing from my original plan to prepare for a lawyer qualification exam in order to get a more stable job in the future,"" said a 24-year-old college graduate, Lee, who majored in business administration during his undergraduate schooling. The new medical and dental school system is getting popularity, attracting an increasing number of students every year since its appearance in 2004, as it is open to all college graduates regardless of their previous majors. The Education Development introduced the new medical and dental education system, in which college students with bachelor's degrees are allowed to study medicine or dentistry by taking the Medical Education Test (MET) and Dental Education Test (DET). Ten medical schools and six dental colleges that have used the new system have received 4,377 applications for the entrance exams. Applicants are getting younger compared with those in their 20s representing 76.9 percent of the total. The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests. Under the existing medical and dental education system, students should take a two-year premedical course followed by a four-year medical course. Students graduating under the new medical or dental education system are given master's degrees, while those graduates who studied under the previous system have bachelor's degrees."

The researchers are now trying to make the wristband _ .	"Smart home applications can share all kinds of helpful information with homeowners. There appears a new housing platform which can detect the stress on electricity -- and the stress on the heart. ""There is a growing population of elderly people, and there are statistics to show that more and more of them are going to live alone in the home,"" said Johann Siau, a senior lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire in the U.K., who was leading the InterHome project. The system was originally designed to provide remote access to a house so owners could be more energy-efficient. In a small type of the system, set-in controller devices connect securely to the Internet. The owner can then monitor them with a cell phone or computer. User feedback helps the system adapt to routines, saving on electricity. While thinking about responding to user behavior and an increasingly elderly population, the researchers decided to add wristband technology that senses important organs of the body such as body temperature and pulse, Siau said. ""If someone were to fall, it would detect the fall and it would immediately start the monitor of the pulse to see if the person has gone into shock ,"" he said. The wristband communicates with the home system wirelessly. Data from the band can be securely transmitted to the home network and accessed by authorized users. ""We're working on trying to reduce it to a level where it could potentially be a wrist-sized product,"" Siau said. But he warned that the technology presented new challenges. ""When you start using that on a larger scale, you have issues of privacy or security,"" he said. Siau said the InterHome home system isn't intended to invade privacy. ""We're thinking about the elderly people who are living alone with no one looking after them,"" he said. ""Hopefully this will be able to decrease some concerns and possibly save a few lives."""

In the view of _ , movement is needed when we want to know something by touching.	"Imagine you're in a dark room, running your fingers over a smooth surface in search of a single dot the size of this period, How high do you think the dot must be for your finger to feel it? Scientists have determined that the human finger is so sensitive it can detect a surface bump just one micron(l0-6m)""high. The human eye, by contrast, can't tell anything much smaller than100 microns.No wonder we rely on touch rather than eyesight when faced with a new roll of toilet paper. Biologically, touch is the mother of all sensory systems.It is an ancient sense in evolution: even the simplest single-celled living things can feel when something brushes up against them and will respond by moving closer or pulling away. It is the first sense aroused during a baby's development and the last to weaken at life's peak. Patients in a deep coma who seem otherwise lost to the world will show skin reaction when touched by a nurse. ""Touch ,is so central to what we are that we almost cannot imagine ourselves without it,"" said Chris Dijkerman.""It's 'not like eyesight, where you close your eyes and you don't see anything. _ .It's always there."" Long ignored in favor of the sensory heavyweights of eyesight and hearing, the study of touch lately:: has been gaining new concern among scientists.They're exploring the effects of recently reported false touch impressions, of people being made to feel as though they had three arms, for example, with the hope of gaining the true understanding of how the mind works. Others are turning to touch for more practical purposes: to build better touch screen instruments and robot hands, a more well-rounded virtual life.. ""There's a fair amount of research into new ways of offloading information onto our sense of touch,"" said Lynette Jones. ""To have your cell phone buzzing (making a low sound) as opposed to ringing turned out to have a lot of advantages in.some situations."" Touch is our most active sense, our means of seizing the world and experiencing it 'first hand. Dr.Susan Lederman pointed out that while we can become aware of something by seeing or hear,ing7;-.from a distance and without really trying, if we want to learn about something by means of touch, we must make a move.We must rub the cloth, or pet the cat. Touching is a two-way street, and that's not true for seeing or hearing. If you have a soft object and you squeeze it, you change its shape. The physical world reacts back."" Our hands are smart and can do many tasks automatically - button a shirt, fit a key in a lock, play the; piano for others.Dr.Lederman and her colleagues have shown that blindfolded subjects can easily recognize a wide range of common -objects placed.in their hands.But on some feeling tasks, touch is all thumbs (very clumsy). When people are given a raised line drawing of a common object, they're puzzled.""If all we've got is outline information;"" Dr.Lederman said,.""no weight, no texture, no temperature information, well, we're very, very bad with that."" Touch also turns out to be easy to fool, Among the sensory tricks now being investigated is something called the Pinocchio illusion. Researchers have found that if they shake the band of the biceps , many people report feeling that their forearm is getting 'longer, their hand floating ever further from their elbow . And if they are told to touch the forefinger of the shaken arm to the tip of their nose, they feel as though their nose was lengthening, too."	['Susan Lederman']
I don't have a green thumb, so all my plants _ .	"Mary can't understand such sentences as ""She is blue today."" ""You are yellow."" ""He has a green thumb ."" ""He tells a white lie."" and so on. And she goes to her teacher for help. Mary: Mrs. Smith, there is a colour in each of these sentence. What do they mean? Mrs. Smith: In everyday English, blue sometimes means sad. Yellow, afraid. A person with a green thumb grows plants well. And a white lie is not a bad one. Mary: Would you please give me an example of a white lie? Mrs. Smith: Certainly. Now I give you some cake. In fact, you don't like it. But you won't say it. Instead, you say, "" No, thanks. I'm not hungry."" That's a white lie. Mary: Oh, I see. Thank you very much."	['die off']
