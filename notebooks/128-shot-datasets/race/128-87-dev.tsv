"Question: ""Remembered history""is regarded as valuable only when_. Context: If we are asked exactly what we were doing a year ago, we might have to say that we could not remember. But if we had kept a book and written in it an account of what we did each day, we should be able to give an answer to the question. It is the same in history. Many things have been forgotten because we do not have any written account of them. Sometimes men did keep a record of the important happenings in their country, but often it was destroyed by fire or in a war. Sometimes there was never any written record at all because the people of that time and place did not know how to write. For example, we know a great deal about the people who lived in china 4,000 years ago, because they could write and leave written records for whose who lived after them. But we know almost nothing about the people who lived even 200 years ago in central Africa, because they had not learned go write. Sometimes, of course, even if the people cannot write, they may know something of the past. They have heard about it from older people, and often songs and dances and stories have been made about the most important happenings, and those have been sung and acted and told for many generations, for most people are proud to tell what their fathers did in the past. This we may call 'remembered history'. Some of it has now been written history, because words are much more easily changed when used again and again in speech than when copied in writing. But where there are no written records, such spoken stories are often very helpful. </s>"	there is no written account </s>
"Question: What is the main cause of the many fires this year? Context: The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, is asking for foreign help to fight forest and agricultural fires in his country. According to Mr Widodo, Indonesian helicopters are only able to carry a small amount of the water needed to put out the fires. "" _ "" the Associated Press reported his comment. The Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space says more than 1,300 fires are burning across the country. The government has sent about 25,000 soldiers, police and firefighters in six provinces to battle the fires. Indonesian farmers and some businesses often burn rainforest to clear land at this time of year. The burning usually takes place during the country's dry season. But a large rise in palm oil production on peat lands is blamed for the many fires this year. Peat is made partly of dead plants, which burns easily and is often used as cooking fuel. The resulting thick, black smoke has polluted skies over Indonesia and four other countries. The burning has worsened air quality, closed schools and caused any outdoor activities to stop. The smoke is not only affecting people; it is affecting wildlife. In Indonesian Borneo, an animal rescue center says some of its animals have developed breathing problems. If the fires continue, a lot more could become sick and some could die. Scientists have warned that the fires this year could be worst ever because of a weather system called El Nino. They say the weather system has created extremely dry conditions in Indonesia. </s>"	The increase in palm oil production. </s>
"Question: The purpose of writing the passage is _ . Context: Today in schools, it's not unusual for students to sit in the same kind of desks in the same kind of classrooms as their parents did. Schools have made progress by making use of computers and PDAs in the classroom, yet one design company believes that changes are needed, so they describe what a future classroom may look like. ""Kids are being taught to sit at these wooden desks that are basically designed for writing,"" said Mark Dziersk, the senior vice president of the design. ""They're being lectured in a structured environment."" The solution is a ""customizable education system"" called Gooru that reorganizes the classroom and replaces books, desks, pens, and so on. The three-part technology system consists of an interactive PDA called the GooBall, a backpack and a removable LCD screen for each student. Students can sit, stand or lie down when using the devices, and are not limited to desks. The idea was presented at last month's South by Southwest Interactive Conference. While some educators think the idea is interesting, they doubt whether schools will pay for the expensive and complicated system. The GooBall is an interactive communication device with six layers of learning software. The device monitors a student's heart rate and body temperature and uses GPS to track where they are. It includes instant messaging, a compass, a watch, and a topic-specific alert system that directs a student to related articles and books about whatever they are studying. Students can also choose an animal icon to show their personality. The backpack houses the main power supply for the system and holds some personal items. The pocket keeps items locked tight with a fingerprint security zipper. The portable screen functions like a laptop, providing wireless Internet access and streaming video. It also has a touch screen interface. ""I think it's an excellent idea,"" said Gary Tankard, a sixth-grader who has seen the prototype . ""I'm sure that 90 percent of kids would really like to have it."" </s>"	to introduce an advanced education system </s>
Question: The doctors came to Herpin's home in order to _ . Context: It doesn't matter when or how much a person sleeps, but everyone needs some rest to stay alive. That's what all doctors thought, until they heard about Al Herpin. Al Herpin, it was said, never slept. Could this be true? The doctors decided to see this strange man themselves. Al Herpin was 90 years old when the doctors came to his home in New Jersey. They thought for sure that he got some sleep of some kind. So they stayed with him and watched every movement he made. But they were surprised. Though they watched him hour after hour and day after day, they never saw Herpin sleeping. In fact, he did not even own a bed. He never needed one. The only rest that Herpin sometimes got was sitting in a comfortable chair and reading newspapers. The doctors were _ by this strange continuous sleeplessness. They asked him many questions, hoping to find an answer. They found only one answer that might explain his condition. Herpin remembered some talk about his mother having been injured several days before he was born. But that was all. Was this the real reason? No one could be sure. Herpin died at the age of 94. </s>	get some proof to show his sleeplessness was not really true </s>

"Question: Wen Jiabao asks local governments _ . Context: BEIJING--Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has visited the ""left-behind"" children whose parents are working in cities before Children's Day. During a visit to northwest China's Shanxi Province, Wen visited the home of Yang Saike, a primary school boy in a village of Xingping City. Yang, whose parents were working in Fujian, thousands of kilometers away, was cared for by his grandparents. His parents fail to go home even once a year. Wen talked with many children and asked them many questions about their schooling and life. ""You are so pretty,"" Wen said to Liu Mengqi, a seven-year-old girl living with her grandmother. Liu's parents were also working in the city. ""Have you been to school yet?"" Wen asked two other girls. ""We are going to the pre-school class,"" said one. ""Mom and dad at home?"" Wen asked. The children shook their heads. ""Children cannot see their parents very often, which is a new problem in the country-side. We should give them more care and love,"" said the premier. The premier asked local governments to do something to protect and care for such children at home and freeing their parents in cities from worries about their children. </s>"	"to do more for ""left-behind"" children and their parents </s>"

"Question: Which of the following things has the writer NOT prepared for disasters? Context: During a recent phone interview with a mom who had just moved to Colorado, the conversation turned to disaster planning."" I am standing here looking out of the window at the smoke from wildfires,"" she told me, ""and have absolutely no idea what we will do if the wind shifts our way."" Fortunately, the fire was put out, saving her home. Making a disaster plan isn't something anyone does for fun. But being caught without one in a time of need is worse. Emergency management officials say too few families have a disaster plan ,even in areas that have been hit hard by hurricanes or flooding. I have prepared food, water, flashlights, candles, a battery-powered radio and firewood since our family was hit years ago by a hurricane that blocked off streets and knocked out our power for more than a week. Still we lack the medications, emergency contacts, and emergency-meeting and pet-care plans we should also have .Officials in my state of Oregon have warned us that one of us is really ready for the major disaster which is very likely to hit here---- a big earthquake. Working parents need to coordinate their disaster plans with their children's schools or child-care centers. Many parents in the 2003 New York blackout weren't able to get home to their children because public traffic was stopped and lights were out. After that, many parents made detailed plans with child-care providers about where to meet in emergencies, an whom to contact if unable to reach each other. Good emergency planning and training helped teachers at a child-care center in the World Trade Center successfully move children to a safe place during the 2001 terrorist attacks.

"Question: The ""e"" in e-mail means _ . Context: The Internet is becoming important in our life. How much do you know about it? The following questions and their answers will help you to know more about the Internet. What is the Internet? The Internet is a large, world-wide collection of computer networks . A network is a small group of computers put together. The Internet is many different kinds of networks from all over the world. These networks are called the Internet. If you have learned to use the Internet, you can have a lot of interest on the World Wide Web . What is the World Wide Web? The World Wide Web has been the most popular development of the Internet. It is like a big electronic book with millions of pages. These pages are called homepages. You can find information about almost anything in the world on these pages. For example, you can use the Internet instead of a library to find information for your homework. You can also find information about your favourite sport or film star, talk to your friends or even do some shopping on the pages. Most pages have words, pictures and even sound or music. What is e-mail? Electronic mail (e-mail) is a way of sending messages to other people. It's much quicker and cheaper than sending a letter. If you want to use e-mail, you must have an e-mail address. This address must have letters and dots and an @ (means ""at""). For example: Lily @ Yahoo.com. Write a message, type a person's e-mail address, and then send the message across the Internet. People don't need to use stamps, envelopes or go to the post office because of the invention of the Internet. Quick, easy and interesting -- that's the Internet. </s>"	electronic </s>
"Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author's father is _ . Context: I get off the bus and walk a few blocks. I stop when I get to a garage-like place and walk to the metal door with brown paint. I turn the knob and walk in. A thousand eyes look at me as I take my place at the end of the long line. When I finally get up to the window, I hand the officer my ID. ""I'm here to visit Mr C. Yes, I'm his daughter."" I learn that line by heart. The officer hands me a piece of paper with my name as the visitor and my father's as the prisoner. It tells me which floor to go to. As I get on the elevator, a rush of excitement runs through me. Then I go to the eighth floor, look around and see the faces I see here every Sunday and Thursday. There he is. I stand on tiptoe to get a better view since I can hardly see him. He doesn't look like my father. He's got a beard now and he looks a lot weaker. He's the dad that I see through a window. My dad who is separated from the world. The only place he now knows is his room in the prison. When I look deep into his eyes, I see emptiness and pain. It's difficult to hear him through the thick glass and over everyone else who is trying to talk. We try to carry on a normal conversation about simple things including my day and what I'm doing in school, but we mostly talk about how we can't wait until he gets out. After an hour my time is up. We say our good-byes and love-yous. I get on the bus to go home. My favorite place is where my father is--prison. I know, how can prison be anyone's favorite place? But it is because my father is there. It'll no longer be my favorite place once he gets out, though--home will be. </s>"	seldom keeping in touch with people outside </s>
"Question: According to the passage, _ can make your memory better. Context: Mark began to introduce the guest speaker to the listeners, but then stopped for a while. He had forgotten her name. Barbara hid her valuable things when she went on vacation. When she came back, she couldn't remember where she'd put them. Perhaps you've had such experiences like these. Most people have. But most of them haven't realized that they have a memory problem. Neither do they know a simple but important fact: Memory can be improved. If you'll just accept that, the following will show you how. First, relax. If you are over worried about something, you'll forget it. If you keep telling yourself that your memory is bad, your mind will come to believe it and you won't remember things. When you forget something, don't follow up with saying like ""Oh, my god! I always forget things!"" Such words will have a bad result on you and your memory. But relaxing isn't enough. To improve your memory, you'll need to take an active role. Like your body, your memory can be made strong through exercise. Look for _ to exercise your memory. For example, if you're learning a language, try to actively remember a lot of new words. If you don't take notice of things actively, you won't remember them. So, you can make pictures of what you see in your mind every day. For example, don't just put your keys down! If you want to find them again, make a mind picture of the place where you're putting them. </s>"	making mind pictures of what you see </s>
"Question: Fitzgerald's will showed _ . Context: The very wealthy English Baron Fitzgerald had only one child, a son, who understandably was the apple of his eye. His wife died when the child was in his early teens. So Fitzgerald devoted himself to (...) fathering the kid. Unfortunately the son died in his late teens. Meanwhile, Fitzgerald's wealth greatly increased. He spent a lot on art works of the masters . Later Fitzgerald himself became seriously ill. Before his death, he had carefully prepared his will as to how his wealth would be settled - to sell his entire collection at an auction . Because of the large quantity and high quality of his collection, a huge crowd of possible buyers gathered for the auction. Many of them were museum directors and private collectors eager to bid . Before the auction, the art works were shown, among which was a painting of Fitzgerald's son by an unknown artist. Because of its poor quality, it received little attention. When it was time for the auction, the auctioneer gaveled the crowd to attention. First the lawyer read from Fitzgerald's will that the first art work to be auctioned was the painting of his son. The poor-quality painting didn't receive any bidders, except one old servant who had served the son and loved him, and who for emotional reasons offered the only bid. As soon as the servant bought the painting for less than one English pound, the auctioneer stopped the bidding and asked the lawyer to read again from the will. The crowd became quiet, and the lawyer read from the will: ""Whoever buys the painting of my son gets all my collection."" Then the auction was over. </s>"	his invaluable love for his son </s>

"Question: An elephant usually travels at a speed of _ per hour. Context: Wild elephants live in herds of 10 to about 50. The leader is usually a female. A herd can go through a forest quietly. It travels in a single line. It goes about 6 miles an hour. When frightened, it may run at about 25 miles an hour. When they reach water, elephants swim across. They are great swimmers. Elephants eat grass, leaves, small branches, and bark. They particularly like the tender leaves on the top of trees. How do they get these leaves? They use their heads to knock trees down. They can easily knock down a 30-foot tree. Elephants also eat berries, mangoes, coconuts, corn, and sugar cane. They love salt. A wild male adult eats 500 to 600 pounds of food a day. Many people want to find the graveyards of elephants. There is a strong belief that such graveyards exist. Here is why. Bones and tusks of dead elephants have almost never been found. Searches have been made in forests. Grassy plains have been searched too. But neither bones nor tusks are found. Elephants don't live forever. Where are their bones? They don't just bury themselves. Here is one belief. When an elephant gets sick or old, it instinctively knows death is near. It leaves the herd. It goes off to a secret graveyard. The place is known only to elephants, and perhaps other animals, but not to humans. Obviously, such a graveyard would be filled with tusks. These were once very valuable. The objective of explorers was to find this ""gold"" mine. This graveyard belief may be a truth or a myth. But it is romantic. It would be nice if it were true. </s>"	around 6 miles </s>

No more Spitz,no more trouble."" Francois started to harness the dogs. He needed a new lead-dog, and decided that Solleks was the best dog that he had. But Buck jumped at Solleks and took his place. ""Look at Buck!"" said Francois,laughing. ""He's killed Spitz,and now he wants to be lead-dog.Go away, Buck!"" He pulled Buck away and tried to harness Solleks again.Solleks was unhappy too. He was frightened of Buck, and when Francois turned his back,Buck took Solleks' place again. Now Francois was angry. ""I'll show you! "" he cried,and went to get a heavy club from the sledge. Buck remembered _ ,and moved away. This time,when Solleks was harnessed as lead-dog,Buck did not try to move in.He kept a few meters away and circled around Francois carefully. But when Francois called him to his old place in front of Dave, Buck refused.He had won his fight with Spitz and he wanted to be lead-dog. For an hour the two men tried to harness him.Buck did not run away,but he did not let them catch him.Finally,Francois sat down,and Perrault looked at his watch.It was getting late. The two men looked at one another and smiled. Francois walked up to Solleks,took off his harness, led him back and harnessed him in his old place.Then he called Buck. All the other dogs were harnessed and the only empty place was now the one at the front. But Buck did not move. ""Put down the club,"" said Perrault. Francois dropped the club, and immediately Buck came up to the front of the team.Francois harnessed him, and in a minute the sledge was moving. Buck was an excellent leader. He moved and thought quickly and led the other dogs well. A new leader made no difference to Dave and Solleks; they continued to pull hard.But the other dogs had had an easy life when Spitz was leading.They were surprised when Buck made them work hard and punished them for their mistakes. Pike,the second dog,was usually lazy;but by the end of the first day he was pulling harder than he had ever pulled in his life. The first night in camp Buck fought Joe,another difficult dog,and after that there were no more problems with him.The team started to pull together,and to move faster and faster.

Daniel was too frightened to move, but soon the warmth of the animal reached Daniel and he began to feel better. From time to time, the puma pressed his muzzle against Daniel and rocked his head gently. Clearly, the puma knew that Daniel must not fall asleep.

On mornings when Samantha had class, Meagan would watch her 2-year-old daughter, Hannah. Also part of the household was Meagan's pet, Willie, a parrot -- a particularly intelligent and chatty breed.

One day with Samantha at school, Hannah sat in front of morning cartoons while Meagan cooked Pop-Tarts in the kitchen. When the toaster spat out the food, Meagan placed it at the center of the kitchen table to cool. She glanced at Hannah and, confident the child was fully engaged in the TV, slipped out quickly to use the bathroom.

Question: The article is about _ . Context: The human body is an amazing and complex machine. It is very tough, and we usually recover from illness or injury on our own, without the help of a doctor. But what happens when we need medical treatment? In the past, some people went to a clinic or hospital to see a medical doctor. Other people trusted ancient traditions and chose treatments such as herbal medicine or acupuncture . These two types of medicine----one modern and Western and the other ancient and Eastern----used to have nothing to do with each other. In recent years, however, people around the world have begun to recognize and accept both modern medical science and more traditional therapies. This new kind of medicine can be called integrative medicine (because it integrates, or combines, different types of medicine), or complementary medicine. Some of the principles of this type of medicine include preventing illness by helping people stay healthy, integrating different types of therapies according to the needs of each patient, and considering the health of the whole person rather than concentrating on a particular illness or injury. One health maintenance organization (HMO) in Madison, Wisconsin, has opened its Complementary Medicine and Wellness Center. At the center, HMO members are offered a variety of services. If you are suffering a sore back, try some massage treatments to relax your muscles and encourage the flow of healing energy in your body. If you have allergies or asthma, you could try homeopathy, which uses tiny amounts of allergens to stimulate your body's natural immune response. And if you're not ill, but just want to improve your strength and focus your mind, try a tai chi or yoga class. Patients who use these complementary medicine services appreciate having an alternative to surgery or to drugs and their side effects. They also enjoy activities and therapies that make them feel better even if they're not sick. And from the financial point of view of the HMO, preventing illness whenever possible is much less expensive than a hospital stay. According to Dr. Andrew Weil, founder of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, integrative medicine combines the best parts of Western medicine with complementary therapies such as acupuncture and nutrition. And because both doctor and patient are working to prevent illness, they become partners with the same goal instead of strangers who see each other only when the patient is sick. </s>	integrative medicine </s>

Question: What is the most important to a lawyer? Context: The law has a great many rules, showing when and how far a man is to be punished, or if he should be made to hand over money or property to his neighbors, and so on. These rules are contained in books. A lawyer learns them mainly by reading books. He begins by doing little else than reading, and after he has prepared himself by three years' study, still, he has to, almost every day, read more about some new questions which he has to answer. The power to use books, then, is a special skill which a would-be lawyer ought to possess. He ought to have enough flexibility to make it easy for him to collect ideas from printed words. He ought to have some readiness to find what a book contains, and something of an instinct for where to look for what he wants. But although this is the power which he will first feel in need of, it is not the most important. A lawyer does not study law to recite it; he studies it to use it and act upon the rules which he has learned in real life. His business is to try cases in court and to advise people what to do in order to keep out or get out of trouble. </s>	To be able to use his book knowledge in the right way in his future business. </s>
"Question: It can be concluded from the passage that _ . Context: Little Robby, our neighbour's nephew, carefully drew some water into a bowl and started for the door. How I hated this water rationing . We were forced to bathe in the deep little pond we shared with Jessie, our cow. Wells were dry, and crops transformed to dust. I watched Robby sitting down onto the steps to my house. Bees buzzed circling his hair, and he buzzed with them. I remembered his aunt's words: I don't know what I was thinking when I took him in. The crash killed my sister, and he wasn't hurt, but he can't talk. He's in a world of all his own. Why couldn't she see _ this boy possessed? He was blessed with a loving nature and a deep admiration for all living things, and I knew he could talk to animals. My heart ached for Robby, who was to stay with us for the summer, and had already been the dearest part of our world, eagerly tending the garden with me and my husband, Tom. On a string around Robby's neck hung a whistle, in case he was ever lost or in danger. After all, he could not call out for help. But he knew perfectly well that the whistle was not a toy.

"Question: The main idea of this passage is that _ . Context: A new study links heavy air pollution from coal burning to shorter lives in northern China.Researchers guess that the half-billion people alive there in the 1990s will live an average of 5 years less than the southerners because they breathed dirtier air. China itself made the comparison possible for decades, a then government policy provided free coal for heating, but only in the colder north. Researchers found great differences in both air pollution and the length of life in the two areas. ""This study provides a unique basis for the question about the life span in northern China because the heating policy dramatically changes pollution concentrations ,"" Michael Greenstone, a professor of environmental economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an email, ""Further,due to the low rates of migration in China in this period, we can know people's exposure over long periods"". The policy gave free coal for fuel boilers to heat homes and offices to cities north of the Huai River which divides China into north and south. It was in effect for much of the 1950-1980 period, of central planning,and though such policy was stopped after 1980, the practice of heavy coal burning in the north goes on, which releases heavy pollutants into the air that can harm human health.Researchers found no other government policies that treated China's north differently from the south. The researchers collected data for 90 cities, from 1981 to 2000, on the annual daily average concentration of total particulates sent out from power stations,construction sites and vehicles. Among them, PM2.5 is of especially great health concern because it can go deep into the lungs. The researchers estimated the impact on the length of life using death data from 1991-2000.They found that in the north, the concentration of pollutants was 184 micrograms per cubic meter, 55 percent higher than in the south, and life length is 55 years lower on average. </s>"	Researchers find air pollution shortens life </s>
Question: Why did sales go up in Sylvan Goldman's grocery store after he began providing shopping carts? Context: The modern world is full of useful objects that were invented by someone, from spoons and chopsticks in our kitchens to the Ipads in our handbags. Each invention is an example of the creative power of the human mind. Where do inventors get their inspirations ? The inspiration behind each of these inventions varies. Take the shopping cart as an example. Sylvan Goldman was a grocery store owner. Like most businessmen, he wished that his customers would buy more so that he could make more money. He knew what if they could carry more goods easily as they were shopping, when his sales would go up. While thinking about the problem one night, he had an idea. Working with a local handyman named Fred Young, he designed the first shopping cart. Today, retailers who use shopping carts sell more goods and make more profits. Nature has also inspired inventors throughout history. This is what happened to George de Mestral one day. While hunting with his dog in the Swiss Alps, he noticed how the burs of certain plants stuck to his clothing and to his dog' s fur. After examining them under a microscope, he found they had tiny hooks that could easily stick to the fibers of clothing or animal hide. For the next ten years, George de Mestral searched for the hest way to produce his idea. The result of his original inspiration was Velcro, which is used in many modem objects, including sportswear, shoes, automobiles, and even space suits. These examples show us that there are at least two possible inspirations for human creativity in the world of inventions -- profit and nature. No doubt, the future will continue to breathe new life into the economies of the world with fresh ideas and inventions. How many of their creations will be inspired by natural phenomena? The world's problems require creativity and we can expect best solutions from future generations. </s>	Because customers were able to carry more items when shopping. </s>
"Question: According to the text we can know that the report of the finding was written by _ . Context: Bigger-brained birds survive better than their feathered friends with smaller brains, according to a study published on Tuesday. Scientists have suspected that birds with large brains in relation to their body size lived longer because they were able to adapt their behavior to environmental challenges. Now they have provided evidence that it does. ""We have tested the hypothesis that the brain can buffer animals against the environment and help them to survive when they face environmental challenges,"" said Daniel Sol of the Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications in Barcelona, Spain. After comparing death rates, brain size and body mass of 236 species of birds from different regions of the world, Sol and scientists in Britain, Hungary and Canada discovered that the bigger the brain the better. Crows and parrots have the largest brains, while pheasants have a relatively small brain. Earlier studies have shown there is a relationship between the size of the brain and an animal's capacity to create new behavior and adapt more easily. ""The idea is that if you have a big brain, you are more capable of adjusting behavior and responding to environmental changes. This can help you to survive,"" said Sol, who reported the finding in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. Tamas Szekely of the University of Bath in England and a co-author of the report, said birds were ideal to test the hypothesis because they are the only species in which brain size and behavioral response to environmental challenges such as climate and habitat destruction is understood. </s>"	Daniel Sol and Tamas Szekely </s>
"Question: From the passage we can infer that _ . Context: Close contacts between Japan and the rest of the world were created in the twentieth century. In the last forty years, business contacts between Japan and the West have become very important. Many foreign companies now have offices in Japan and Japanese businessmen do business around the world. Differences between Japanese and Western ways of doing business, however, often _ and make doing business in Japan difficult for foreigners. The American businessman, for example, wants to start talking business immediately. He does not want to wait. The Japanese businessman, on the other hand, likes to arrive at decisions after giving them serious thought. Another thing foreign businessmen have difficulty in understanding is when a Japanese means ""Yes"" or ""No"". This is because of cultural differences between Japanese and Western society , Which make it difficult for a Japanese to say ""No"" directly. In the USA, it is easy to say ""No"" to something one does not want to do. But in Japan, it is very difficult to say ""No"". To refuse an invitation or a request with ""No"" is felt to be impolite. It is thought to be selfish and unfriendly. So instead of saying ""No"" directly, the Japanese have developed many ways to avoid saying ""No"". These can help them avoid hurting other people's feelings. However, this often makes their ways of doing business rather difficult for foreigners to understand and follow. </s>"	foreign businessmen should try to know Japanese ways of doing business </s>

Question: From the passage, we know that _ . Context: If you think American cooking means opening a package and throwing the contents into the microwave oven , think again. On the one hand, it's true that many Americans have cold cereal for breakfast, sandwiches for lunch and instant dinners. From busy homemakers to working people, many Americans enjoy the convenience of fast food that can be ready to serve in 10 minutes or less. On the other hand, many Americans realize the importance of cooking skills. Parents -- especially mothers -- see the importance of training their children -- especially daughters. Most Americans think that there's nothing better than a good home-cooked meal. _ . Probably every cook has his or her own way of cooking. But there are some basic skills that most people follow. For example, baking is a main method of preparing food in America. For that reason, Americans would find it next to impossible to live without an oven. American cooks pay special attention to the balance of foods, too. In planning a big meal they try to include meat, a few vegetables, some bread and often a dessert. They also like to make sure the meal is colorful. Having several different colors of food on the plate usually makes for a healthy meal. For those who need guidance in their cooking, or for those who have just run out of ideas, recipes are a great help. Recipes list all the ingredients for a dish (generally in the order used), the amount of each to use, and a description of how to put them together. </s>	an oven plays an important role in cooking for Americans </s>

They had given up and were on the ground breathing heavily. As I started the third lap, only a few of my classmates were on the track. By the time I hit the fourth lap, I was alone. Then it hit me that nobody had given up. Instead, everyone had already finished. As I ran that last lap, I cried. And 12 minutes, 42 seconds after starting, I crossed the finishing line.

Question: What is surprising about the standard of the clothing industry? Context: It is hardly surprising that clothing manufacturers follow certain uniform standards for various features of clothes. What seems strange, however, is that the standard adopted for women is the opposite of the one for men. Take a look at the way your clothes button. Men's clothes tend to button from the right, and women's from the left. Considering most of the world's population--men and women--are right-handed, the men's standard would appear to make more sense for women. So why do women's clothes button from the left? History really seems to matter here. Buttons first appeared only on the clothes of the rich in the 17thcentury, when rich women were dressed by servants. For the mostly right-handed servants, having women's shirts button from the left would be easier. On the other hand, having men's shirt button from the right made sense, too. Most men dressed themselves, and a sword drawn from the left with the right hand would be less likely to get caught in the shirt. Today women are seldom dressed by servants, but buttoning from the left is still the standard for them. Is it interesting? Actually, a standard, once set, resists change. At a time when all women's shirts buttoned from the left, it would have been risky for any single manufacturer to offer women's shirts that buttoned from the right. After all, women had grown so used to shirts which buttoned from the left and would have to develop new habits and skills to switch. Besides, some women might have found it socially awkward to appear in public wearing shirts that buttoned from the right, since any one who noticed that would believe they were wearing men's shirts. </s>	It is different for men's clothing and women's. </s>
"Question: The article is mainly about _ . Context: Recently I paid a visit to Harvard University, where there are top class scientists and professors and the best academic system in the world. I was pretty shocked when I first stepped onto the campus. Well, it's not even really a campus. It's more like a district in a small town. Harvard's main buildings are from the 18thcentury. They look very old and simple. You might even say they're a little shabby. They don't fit the modern idea of university at all. The buildings are surrounded by grass and trees, so I felt as if I had walked into a medieval castle. But when I looked across the street, busy shops and in-fashion students made me feel like I was in the 21stcentury again. It creates a strong contrast and brings a special atmosphere to the school. Our tour guide Gary took us around and told us, ""You see this grass field in the center of the school? Here is where they host their graduation ceremony. They just set up tents and benches and have a very simple ceremony. Unbelievable! Who would think the most talented students just graduate on the lawn?"" I saw some students put a blanket on the grass and lie down to read a book. When I listened to the soft sound of pages turning, along with the chirping of the birds, I felt very calm. There was no competitive feeling at all. Harvard has the world's first computer in its science center and there are hundreds of high-end computers too. Its religion and the literature departments are also among the best. It is the perfect mix of tradition and new technology. It makes Harvard a very attractive place to study in.

"Question: What can be inferred from the passage? Context: Real-life Friends Most people know the saying: A man's best friend is his dog; and that Diamonds are a girl's best friend. However, dogs can't offer advice or make you a cup of tea when you need one; and precious stones are cold comfort when you need a hug, and a shoulder to cry on. What are Friends? There are many ways to describe a friend. Friends are the family you can choose for yourself. Friends are a much better medication than medication is, and people who spend time with friends are happier with their lives as they are less lonely. A good friend will put you to bed when you're lost consciousness. Ensure you're not laid on your back, and remember to remove your shoes. You should be able to tell a true friend anything without being judged by them. How do Friendships Begin? This is an easy question. Find someone else who has similar interests with you. You now have another person to talk to about your shared interest but remember they like to talk too, so be prepared to shut up and listen once in a while. Hopefully they will have other friends and will introduce you to them, thereby expanding your circle. Friendships which begin due to location, for example, next-door neighbors or school classmates, rarely survive transitions such as moving to other neighborhoods, schools, colleges, jobs, immigration, and so forth. Attend a school reunion and you'll wonder what on earth you ever had in common with these people other than your age, although it is possible to have a friendship with someone you met at school. Mutually maintain it, and eventually become godparent or ""uncle"" to each others' children. How Friendships are Maintained To have a friend you must also be a friend and be prepared to be there for them should they need you. Failure in this respect would label you and you would most probably be abandoned. Boundaries Like every other relationship you have in your life, there are boundaries you shouldn't cross with your friends. One of those is money: Don't lend to your friend and don't ask for a loan yourself. Friends are unpaid counselors ,but phoning them at 2 am because you're awake and would like a chat is not a good idea. Neither is phoning them at 10 am if you know they're a shift-worker. Friends are people who need some space and quiet time. Generally, it all boils down to mutual respect and understanding. It's not a good plan to interrupt your friend while they're on a date/on holiday/attending an orchestral recital/at a funeral. Trust Trust is the most vital element in any relationship. If you're not trustworthy then you probably don't deserve friends, so try to remember that you promised to see that dull film with them or applaud them at their first attempt at a karaoke or an Open Mic night. If you have promised to look after their clothes while they go for a bet, then make sure you do. You might like to carry enough cash to help them out too, as you never know when that situation might be reversed. Don't lie to your friend: if they know you well they'll know you're lying or will at least be suspicious. If you find out something that you know will hurt your friend, be tactful . Do they need to know? Would they appreciate knowing? Can you tell their mum so she can break the news? Cowardly, yes, but mums usually have a much better way with words. Remember, if you do decide to tell them and it's painful, they will probably need some time alone, after lashing out at the closest thing--you. In that case, play the waiting game. Then don't beat them up about it afterwards. A Friend for Life Strong friendships can last a lifetime with care and consideration. The benefits are multi-folds; you've got someone to share birthday cake with, and especially for single people, a pub meal or a trip to the cinema is no fun alone, is it? Plus it's always nice to know there's someone there for you, as you're there for them, through the bad times as well as the good. Altogether now: Oh I get by with a little help from my friends. Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends. </s>"	You may lose a friend if you are always telling lies to him or her. </s>
"Question: The writer would probably describe himself as _ . Context: Are you an optimist? Do you look at your glass and see it as half full? Do you believe that every cloud has a silver lining and that things generally turn out for the best? Do you believe that if something is meant to be, it will be? If you reply ""yes"" to all of these questions, then you are an optimist. You probably are enthusiastic, cheerful and outgoing. You may be successful at work and in love. But you may be misguided because things don't turn out for the best. You may believe that when one door closes another one opens (for example, you may fail to obtain a new job; another chance will come around soon). Wrong. When one door closes, another door slams in your face. That's bitter reality. Now a book has been published which confirms what pessimists have suspected all along. It's called The Positive Power of Defensive Pessimism. Its author argues that defensive pessimism can lead to positive results. Defensive pessimism is a strategy used to manage fear, anxiety and worry. Defensive pessimists prepare for the things by setting low outcomes for themselves. They carefully consider everything that may go wrong and plan for ways to handle these problems. And this gives them a sense of control. Lawrence Sanno, a psychology professor, says, ""What's interesting about defensive pessimists is that they tend to be very successful people, so their low opinion of the situation's outcomes is not realistic. They use it to motivate themselves to perform better."" So far, so good. _ . Defensive pessimists prepare carefully and consider what might go wrong, whether at work, on date or even in a sports game. It makes sense to have a back-up plan. There are many sayings in English urging caution. For example, ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket."" And ""Don't count your chickens until they hatch."" To have a confident and optimistic approach to life's problems is good. But listen to what Woody Alien, the American comedian says, ""Confidence is what you have before you understand the problem."" There are pros and cons to being an optimist and a pessimist. Don't feel bad if you see the glass half empty. You are a realist. But lighten up and hook up with someone who sees the same glass half full. </s>"	a realist </s>
Question: What is this passage mainly about? Context: I have never understood why so many people visit Rome from late spring to early autumn, when traffic, heat and stressed shopkeepers and waiters lead to the lower tone of the city. Things improve a little in March, April, October and November. But connoisseurs know that winter is the best time to go there. In winter, the low-flying sun turns Rome into a wonderful stage set. There are days in winter when the sky is kind of blue. And there are also days when you find that you have beautiful sights all to yourself. Perhaps the only period you might want to avoid is the two weeks before Christmas. Italians often leave their shopping late, and traffic in the city is often heavy. But this can also be a good time to come if you are more interested in culture than in fashion shops; if you stay somewhere central, you can beat the traffic by walking everywhere. Christmas in Rome is a low-key family event. One of the nice things is the way the city keeps going. Although museums and shops are closed, many bars and restaurants stay open, and public transport continues to run. If you are lucky with the weather, it's in January and February that Rome is at its best. Late February can be especially attractive. One sometimes forgets what a difference that extra hour of daylight makes compared with mid-December. And there are always a few days of proper sunshine, when you can picnic in Villa Borghese and Pompeii. </s>	When is the best time to visit Rome. </s>

Context: Expanded use of computer technology ,development of stronger and lighter materials ,and research on pollution control will produce better, _ automobiles . In the 1980s the ides that a car would ""talk"" to its driver was science fiction; by the 1990s it had become reality. On board navigation was one of the new automotive technologies in the 1990s.

The onboard navigation system uses and electronic compass ,digitized maps , and a display screen showing where the car is to the destination the driver wants to reach. After being told the destination, the computer locates it and directs the driver to it , offering alternative routes if needed. Some cars now come equipped with GPS locator beacons ,enabling a GPS system operator to locate the vehicle ,map its location and ,if necessary ,direct repair or emergency workers to the scene.

Challenger.Setting out from England in 1872,the Challenger spent almost three and a half years gathering a wealth of information about seawater,sea life,and the ocean floor.Major oceanographic expeditions since then have included the South Atlantic voyage of the German ship Meteor in 1926 and the Deep-Sea Drilling Project from 1968 to 1983.Many individuals also have played important roles in advancing our understanding of oceans,beginning with Matthew Fontaine Maury in the mid-1800s;his work on oceanography and navigation led to a uniform system of weather reporting at sea.Since Maury's time,oceanography has progressed rapidly.Early oceanographers had to contend themselves with tossing buckets overboard to see what they might haul in.Today's oceanographers are equipped with space images,supercomputer models,and deep-sea robots that can crawl along the seafloor.As they set goals for the future,some oceanographers even dream of doing research in permanently manned stations on the bottom of the oceans. </s>	The expeditions in the past had great difficulty and made a lot of efforts in order to study the oceans. </s>
"Question: One can never learn a foreign language well only by _ . Context: In order to know a foreign language thoroughly , four things are necessary. First, we must understand the language when we hear it spoken. Secondly, we must be able to speak it ourselves, correctly with confidence and without hesitation . Thirdly, we must be able to write it. We must be able to make sentences that are correct in grammar. There is no short way to succeed in language learning. A good memory is a great help, but it is not enough only to memorize the rules from a grammar book. It is no much use learning by heart long lists of words and their meanings, studying the dictionary and so on. We must learn by using the language. If we are pleased with a few rules we have memorized, we are not really learning the language. We must ""Learn through use"". Practice is important. We must practise speaking and writing the language whenever we can. </s>"	studying the dictionary </s>
Question: According to the text, the main problem for Rod Matless was _ . Context: It's not often a tomato is described as so sweet 'whenever people see it they just want to hug it'--but this was no ordinary piece of fruit.

Mr Matless, 69, who had a heart attack a few years ago, was so _ the fruit that he decided to sell it and donate the money to the British Heart Foundation. The 64g tomato was bought for PS16 on eBay by a woman from Wales--who said she planned to give it to someone special. Mr Matless, of Wymondham, near Norwich, said: 'I spent a couple of days thinking about what to do with it and I wasn't really sure, but this seems like a good use. I hope it will do someone somewhere a bit of good'. He added: 'It's very sweet--whenever people see it they just want to hug it.' But with the tomato's freshness a key factor , Mr Matless was up against the clock to send it to its new owner before it went bad. He said: 'I didn't want to send someone something horrible . I probably could have raised a bit more money with more time but I was worried about it.' 'It will certainly make a nice present for a loved one. I hope that they like it and I'm glad I got to help.

"Question: According to the study, we know musical education can _ . Context: Let's say you took violin lessons all through elementary school, but you haven't got the instrument out of its case for years. Were all those lessons a waste of your parents' money because you didn't become a violinist? Even though it has been a long time since you played the violin, a new study shows that as little as one year of music training can have a positive impact on your brain that will last the rest of your life. In an experiment, researchers compared children who had taken music lessons to those who hadn't. Laurel Trainor, who studies music and the mind, discovered that the musically-trained children had better brain responses in certain sound recognition exams. Trainor's findings show the possibility that musical education can actually improve the brain's hearing cortex . ""The study's results show that music training affects attention and memory, and helps children develop learning skills. In this way music training might lead to better learning across a number of fields,"" Trainor said in a statement. The effects of music education are even more obvious on children with difficulty in reading and writing and other language-related disabilities. So, whether you can play a good piece of music or not, it's likely that your years of music lessons have prepared your brain for all the speeches, emails, and adult conversations that are part of your life today. We should help make sure that children today have the same opportunities for music, and help out by volunteering with or donating instruments to your school's music education department. </s>"	improve children's learning skills </s>

Good drill, but very hard, and my only comfort was the evening reunion where all met with such various reports of the day's adventures, we could not fail to find both amusement and instruction. Father brought interesting and attractive news from the upper world; mother, usually in low spirits because she would give away her clothes with sad tales of suffering from the darker side of life; gentle Anna gave a modest account of her success as a teacher, for even at seventeen her sweet nature won all who knew her, and her patience gained her the support of the most naughty pupil.

"Question: This passage is mainly about _ . Context: Jeans are trousers made of a kind of clothe called denim. For many people, blue jeans represent American culture. The history of blue jeans usually begins with a man named Levi Strauss. Although he did not invent the jeans, he is considered the first person to produce and sell this kind of clothing in large amounts. Levi Strauss was born in Bavaria, Germany. In 1847, he and his family moved to the US. He opened a store, first in New York, and then in San Francisco, California. Among the products he sold were jeans. These trousers were especially useful for miners in California who needed clothing made of a strong material. Levi Strauss partnered with a clothing maker named Jacob Davis, who had invented a process for making rivets for jeans. These metal things helped strengthen the blue jean cloth to make the trousers stronger. In 1873, Strauss and Davis received a patent to officially own this invention. They began producing "" copper-riveted waist overalls "". In 1928 the Levi Strauss company used the word ""Levi's"" as the trademark for their products. The 19th-century workers would probably be surprised to know that their trousers would one day become a fashion object. Today, jeans are worn by people of all ages, incomes and lifestyles. Jeans come in many colors other than blue and in many styles and at many prices. A national museum in Washington, D.C. has one of the oldest known pairs of Levi's jeans in its collection. Jeans have come to express different ideas about American culture based on the people who wear them. These include the heroes of the Wild West and famous Hollywood actors like James Dean and Marlon Brando in the 1950s. Writer James Sullivan published a book called Jean: A Cultural History of an American Icon. In the book, he says jeans serve as a sign for two American values, creativity and rebellion . </s>"	the history of jeans </s>
"Question: The best title of the passage is _ . Context: The film Avatar has been a hit at the box office in the UK and around the world, becoming the fastest film ever to earn $1bn (7bn yuan) in ticket sales. But the world of the sci-fi epic Avatar is so perfect that people have admitted being troubled by depression and suicidal thoughts at not being able to visit the planet. Set in the future when Earth's resources have run out, director James Cameron's film tells the story of a corporation trying to mine a rare mineral. The humans conflict with the natives-- a peace-loving race of 7ft tall, blue-skinned creatures called the Na'vi, who exist in perfect harmony with nature. Fans have flooded the internet with their confused feelings. On the site Avatar Forums , the topic ""Ways to cope with the depression of the dream of Pandora being intangible "" has more than 1,000 posts. In a similar forum, one user wrote, ""When I woke up this morning after watching Avatar for the first time yesterday, the world seemed grey. It just seems so meaningless."" ""I still don't really see any reason to keep doing things at all. I live in a dying world."" On another site, one fan was even more affected, admitting, ""I even consider suicide, thinking that if I do it I will be rebirthed in a world similar to Pandora."" On the Avatar site Naviblue, a fan calling himself Jorba has even asked others to join him in starting a real Na'vi tribe . Dr Stephan Quentzel, psychiatrist and Medical Director in New York told CNN, ""Virtual life is not real life and it never will be, but this is the pinnacle of what we can build in a virtual presentation so far."" ""It has taken the best of our technology to create this virtual world and real life will never be as utopian as it seems on screen. It makes real life seem more imperfect."" But not everyone viewing the film has been hit by the ""Avatar Blues"", as a small but vocal group have claimed it contains racist themes-- the white hero once again saving the primitive natives. Since the film opened three weeks ago, hundreds of blog posts, newspaper articles and YouTube videos have said things such as the film is ""a fantasy about race told from the point of view of white people"" and that it strengthens ""the white Messiah fable ."" The film's writer and director, James Cameron, says the real theme is about respecting others' differences. </s>"	Avatar's Perfection Causing Depression </s>
Question: Why did the writer walk in the rain without her shoes two days ago? Context: I have tried many ways to be ill. I don't wear a sweater when I should, and two days ago I walked in the rain without my shoes. But so far nothing has happened. Debbie once told me about a boy in her class who liked being away from school. He would rub the end of the thermometer until it went up to 39degC. Then he'd put it in his mouth and his mother would think he was really ill. This morning I tried doing that but it never went above 35degC and I rubbed it for ten minutes. So I held the thermometer next to the light on my desk and it went up to 40degC. I thought I'd put it in my mouth and walk downstairs like that. Then my mother would take it out and she would be worried when she saw that I was rather ill. The only trouble was I didn't know the thermometer would be so hot. As soon as I put it into my mouth, it burnt my tongue! I spit the thermometer out. It fell on the floor but it didn't break.

Question: In what way are men different from animals? Context: Man has a big brain. He can think, learn and speak. Scientists once thought that men are different from animals because they can think and learn. They know that animals can learn--dogs, rats, birds can learn. So scientists are beginning to understand that men are different from animals because they can speak. Animals cannot speak. They make noises when they are afraid, or angry, or unhappy. Apes can understand some things more quickly than human, one or two have learnt a few words. But they are still different from us. They cannot join words and make sentences; they cannot think like us because they have no language. They can never think about the past or the future. Language is a wonderful thing. Man has been able to build a modern world because he has language. Every child can speak his own language very well when he is four or five--but no animal learns to speak. How do children learn? What happens when we speak? Scientists do not know. They only know that man can speak because he has a big brain. </s>	Men have learnt to use language. </s>
"Question: It can be learned from the passage that the blind students in China _ . Context: One determined student stepped off the traditional job for blind people in China, and now challenges a new life at university in Britain. Being a message therapist is a perfect job for many people with a visual disability, but for Zheng Jianwei, it was far from enough. The 30-year-old former massage therapist gave up his hospital job in 2009to prepare for admission to graduate school. He took IELTS , the language-fluency test necessary for university admission in the UK, in 2012 and scored 6.5 points. He was the first blind examinee to take the IELTS in the Southeast Chinese region. After about four year's struggles, Zheng successfully gain an offer from the University of Essex in the United Kingdom and became a graduate student. However,Zheng's path to graduate school was not easy. ""I can't take China's national entrance exam for graduate school, which doesn't provide study material for blind students,"" he says. He then turned to search for graduate school overseas. However, English became his nightmare. Zheng studied in special schools for visually challenged students since primary school, but foreign language was never a main subject. Before giving up his job and learning English again in 2009, Zheng only knew the alphabet, a few words and some basic expressions. ""Learning English again in my late 20s is not easy,"" he says. It took him three years of intensive study to gain entrance to a graduate school overseas. Because of the lack of study material, Zheng needs to spend hours and days looking for textbooks for the visually disabled and copying them, while it may take only five minutes for a sighted person to order a plain English textbook from Amazon. In his parents' eyes, Zheng has been a sensible, independent and decisive man from a young age. Zheng made all the major decisions by himself, including studying abroad and choosing majors.

Question: According to the passage, which of the following is true? Context: They are most likely to be healthy, wealthy and wise, according to the old saying. But those who are early to bed and early to rise do not always have the upper hand, researchers say. They have revealed that night owls are generally brighter and wealthier than those able to get up early in the morning. 1 Experts from the University of Madrid carried out tests on around 1,000 teenagers and found that those who preferred to stay up late demonstrated the kind of intelligence associated with honored jobs and higher incomes. 2 The researchers examined the habits and body clocks of the youngsters to determine whether they liked to stay up late and sleep in later in the morning, or preferred to go to bed early and were at their peak in the morning. 3 School performance and inductive intelligence, or problem solving, were measured and academic grades in the major subjects were also taken into account. The results showed that evening types scored higher than morning types on inductive reasoning, which has been shown to be a good estimate of general intelligence and a strong indicator of academic performance. 4 They also had a greater capacity to think conceptually as well as analytically. Such abilities have been linked to innovative thinking, more admired occupations and better incomes. Famous night owls include President Obama, Charles Darwin, Winston Churchill, Keith Richards and Elvis Presley. George W Bush, who is regularly in bed by 10pm, Thomas Edison, Napoleon, Condoleezza Rice, who wakes at 4.30am, and Ernest Hemingway are among those known as larks . Jim Horne, professor of psychophysiology at Loughborough University, said: 'Evening types tend to be the more active and creative types, the poets, artists and inventors, while the morning types are the deducers , as often seen with civil servants and accountants.' A previous study of US Air Force recruits found evening types were much better at thinking laterally to solve problems than larks. </s>	Night owls usually do poorer in the examinations than larks. </s>
"Question: What are the rules for setting up a new school in Denmark? Context: In Denmark, parents are allowed to set up a new school if they are dissatisfied with the school in the area where they are living. Although these schools have to follow the national courses, they are allowed a lot of choice in deciding what to teach. Some of these new schools are called ""small schools"" because usually the number of pupils in them is only sixty, but a school has to have at least twenty-seven pupils. Cooleenbridge School in Ireland, is a small school similar to the ones in Denmark, it was set up by parents who came from Holland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, England and other parts of Ireland. They came because they wanted to live in the countryside and to grow their own food. In June 1986, they decided to start a school. They managed to get an old, disused primary-school building and started with twenty-four children aged from four to twelve. The teachers say, ""The important thing in school is doing, not sitting.""

Question: The subjects to be tested in the SAT include _ . Context: Every year in America, high-school students who want to go to college take a national examination called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, or SAT in a shortened way. Their score is an important factor in determining which colleges will admit them or whether any will be admitted at all. The Scholastic Aptitude Test measures one's mathematical ability and use of the English language. Traditionally, the English portion involved grammatical questions and paragraphs that test reading comprehension. But the SAT folks have added a single question, to be answered in an essay, hand-written on the spot. That's an interesting way to test writing ability, put content aside, have you ever seen young people's handwriting lately? Or anyone's for that matter, in this age of computer keyboards? Students write numbers and sign their names on bank checks. They _ class notes in what can generously be described as the written word. And they hand-write, or more often print, a word or two of identification on luggage and lunch bags. Otherwise penmanship -- once taught so morally and easefully by second-grade teachers, has gone the way of the dodo bird which has died out. Yet today's kids are asked to write, thoughtfully and legibly , for several minutes on this SAT Test. Good luck to the text scorers who must work out difficultly the scrawl of young people who've been typing on computers since the age of three! Teachers insist that good handwriting can not only help one's score on the SAT, but also, later on in life, impress potential employers and earn bigger tax refunds because the tax inspectors can actually read the computations . And don't forget, we all have to turn to handwriting from time to time, as computers go down when power goes out. </s>	math, grammar, reading and writing </s>

Secondly , pruning may be done to make the tree healthier . You may cut out diseased or dead wood , or branches that are rubbing against each other and thus cause wounds . The health of a tree may be encouraged by removing branches that are blocking up the center and so preventing the free movement of air . One result of pruning is that an open wound is left on the tree and this provides an easy entry for disease , but it is a wound that will heal . Often there is a race between the healing and the disease as to whether the tree will live or die , so that there is a period when the tree is at risk . It should be the aim of every gardener to reduce that risk of death as far as possible . It is important to make the area , which has been pruned , smooth and clean , for healing will be slowed down by roughness . You should allow the cut surface to dry for a few hours and then paint it with one of the materials available from garden shops produced especially for this purpose . Pruning is usually done in winter , for then you can see the shape of the tree clearly without interference from the leaves and also it is very unlikely that the cuts you make will bleed . If this does happen , it is , of course , impossible to paint them properly . </s>	To introduce some common knowledge of pruning . </s>
"Question: Which of the following can be the best title for this passage? Context: Almost nothing we do in this world is done in isolation*. At work or at play, you'll find yourself in groups, working with other people: your team at work, a meeting with fellow workers, your family, a holiday with friends, a group of students working together, a group of neighbors wanting to make changes. It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, ""True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens."" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise. They need to be able to work out good solutions and make perfect judgments* under pressure. Lastly, and probably most importantly, good leaders need to be sensitive*, confident and be able to get on well with different kinds of people. </s>"	How to be successful leaders </s>

"Question: Toothed whales look for food under the sea by _ . Context: Ears are for hearing -- everyone knows that. But for a creature called the Cuvier's beaked whale, hearing starts in the throat, a new study found. The observation might help explain how all whales hear. The work might also help scientists understand how animals are affected by underwater sonar . This sonar, used by some ships, sends out sound waves to locate underwater objects. The Cuvier's beaked whale is a so-called toothed whale. Toothed whales dive deep into the ocean in search of food. As the whales hunt, they produce sounds that reach objects and then return to the whales. This allows the animals to ""see"" the shape, size, and location of objects, even when they're 1,000 meters under the sea, where it is totally dark. To better understand how the whale hears, researchers from San Diego State University in California took X-rays of two Cuvier's beaked whales. The whales had died and washed up on the beach. Ted Cranford and his colleagues used the images to make a computer model of a Cuvier's beaked whale's head. Then, they modeled the process of sound traveling through the head. The researchers knew that some sounds get to the ears of a toothed whale through a structure called ""the window for sound"". Found on the lower jaw, this structure is very thin on the outside and has a large pad of fat on the inside. When the researchers used their computer model to work out how sound waves travel in the whale's head, they were surprised to find that sounds coming from right in front of the whale actually travel under the animal's jaw. From there, sound waves move through the throat, into a hole in the back of the jaw, and finally to the pad of fat near the animal's ears. Cranford guesses that other types of whales may hear through their throats. Further testing is needed to be sure. Eventually, the insight into how whales hear might explain whether sonar testing by military ships is causing the animals to wind up on beaches. </s>"	sending and receiving sounds </s>

She thought about telling the teacher, but what would everyone else think of her? ""Stop writing and put your pens down"" said Mr. Reed as he started to collect the exam papers. Oh no, Mo hadn't answered two of the questions. She was going to fail again! Mo wanted to talk to Terry at lunch time, but she couldn't find her anywhere. The next exam was history. That was Mo's favourite subject but she wasn't feeling good. Mo went to the library to study, but she couldn't concentrate. She didn't know what to do about Terry. She thought about telling a teacher, but everyone would hate her if she did that. ""It wasn't fair!"" she thought. ""Terry was getting good grades by cheating all that time."" thought Mo. Just then, Mr. Reed walked past her table. ""Mr. Reed."" Mo was sitting behind Terry again in the history exam that afternoon. Mo was feeling terrible. Why had she told Mr. Reed? But it was too late now. And anyway, Terry didn't want to be her friend! Mr. Reed wanted her to look at him and nod if she saw that Terry was cheating in the exam. She was working on the last question when she saw that Terry had her phone under the table. Without thinking, Mo looked up and nodded to Mr. Reed. Terry was too busy looking at her phone and she didn't hear him as he walked silently up to her table. Mr. Reed didn't say anything.

"Question: It can be concluded from the passage that Context: The audience nodded in agreement when the speaker, a teacher from a community college, said, ""High school English teachers are not doing their jobs."" He described the shortcomings of his students, all high school graduates who can use language only at Grade 9 level. I was unable to determine from his answers to my questions ho. w this grade 9 level had been raised. My topic is neither standards nor its decline . What the speaker was really saying is that he is no longer young; he has been teaching for sixteen years, and is able to think and speak like an adult. My point is that the frequent complaint of one generation about the next is unavoidable. It is also human nature to look for the reason for our dissatisfaction. Before English became a school subject in the late nineteenth century, it was difficult to find the target of the blame for language limitation. But since then, English teachers have been under constant attack. The complainers think they have hit upon an original idea. As their own command of the language improves, they notice that young people do not have this same ability. Unaware that their own ability has developed through the years, they take as true the new generation of young people must be hopeless in this respect. To the eyes and ears of adults the language of the young never seems enough. Since this concern about the fall of the English language is not taken as a generation phenomenon but rather as something new to today's young people, it naturally follows that today's English teachers cannot be doing their jobs. Otherwise, young people would not make mistakes of the language. </s>"	language improvement needs time and effort </s>
"Question: .We can know from the passage that _ Context: Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, but with night skies around 1,000 times brighter than globally accepted levels, it gains a bad reputation for its light pollution. A study by Hong Kong University found that brightness levels in the southern Chinese city's popular shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui were 1,200 times greater than the international dark sky standard. The crowded city of 7 million residents , full or residential high-rises, towering office blocks and neon advertisements, has no laws to control outdoor lightning. The result is that light pollution is thought to be much worse than in other large cities, including London, Sydney, Tokyo and Shanghai. ""In Hong Kong , you can't go anywhere outdoor in the evening without your eyes being blinded by this really disturbing outdoor lightning,"" the light pollution survey's head Jason Pum told AFP. ""The fact that we have all this light in the sky means energy is wasted,"" he said, adding that too much artificial lightning also affects nightly wildlife. Research has suggested that light pollution can cause a number of harmful health effects in humans, including sleeplessness and headaches and can also interrupt body clocks and hormones . The university survey, the result of five million measurements taken from points across the city, was released just days before the start of the annual Earth Hour event, organized by the World Wildlife Fund. People around the world will be encouraged to turn off the lights for an hour on Saturday night to raise awareness of climate change.

Question: According to the passage, where is the Egyptian mummy now? Context: Is it possible that the sinking of the Titanic was caused by a ghost? A lot of the story below is true... but did it really happen quite like this? Our story begins not in the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic, but rather thousands of miles away in Egypt. It is here, perhaps, that we can find the start of the mystery of the Titanic, in the year 1910, in the great city of Cairo. One day, a famous professor of Egyptian history called Douglas Murray was staying in Cairo, when he was contacted by an American adventurer. The American had something unusual to offer Murray, something that was certain to thrill him: a beautiful ancient Egyptian mummy case, containing the mummy of an Egyptian queen. It was over 3000 years old, but in beautiful condition -- gold, with bright paintings on it. Murray was delighted with both the object and the asking price. He gave the man a cheque immediately. The cheque was never cashed. That evening the American adventurer died. For his part, Murray arranged to have the treasure sent back to Britain. However, it was not long before he learnt more about the beautiful mummy case: On the walls of the tomb in which it had been discovered, there were messages which warned of terrible consequences to anyone who broke into the tomb. Murray was disbelieving of these warnings until a few days later, when a gun he was holding exploded in his hand, shattering his arm. The arm had to be cut off. After the accident, Murray decided to return to his homeland. On the return journey, two of his companions died mysteriously, and two servants who had handled the mummy also passed away. The now-terrified Murray decided he would get rid of the _ case as soon as he arrived in London. A lady he knew named Janet Jones said she would like it, so he gave it to her. Shortly afterwards, Jones' mother died, and she herself caught a strange disease. She tried returning the mummy, but naturally Murray refused it. In the end, it was presented to the British Museum. Even in the museum, the mummy apparently continued to cause strange events. A museum photographer died shortly after taking pictures of the new exhibit; and a manager also died for no apparent reason. In the end, the British Museum decided to get rid of the mummy too. They sold it to a collector in New York. At the start of April 1912, arrangements for the transfer were complete, and the mummy began the journey to its new home. But the New Yorker never received the mummy or its case. For when the Titanic sank, one of the objects in its strong room was the mummy case. Or so they say. </s>	Under the sea. </s>
Question: How many vacation days do Americans have on average each year in fact? Context: It's so beautiful outside that spending the day in the office would be very boring.

We spend about a third (1/3) of our lives sleeping. That's about 121 days a year! How much sleep do we need? We are all different. A baby needs 16 hours of sleep every day. Children 6 to 12 years old need an average of 10 to 12 hours of sleep. Teenagers need 9 to 10 hours of sleep. An adult needs an average of 7 to 8 hours a night. There are some people who need only 3 hours of sleep. Others need 10 hours of sleep. After the age of 50, the average sleep time goes down to 6.5 hours a night. We need less sleep as we get older.

"Question: How can we help sick people if we understand more ""words"" in the DNA map? Context: DNA is the whole ""map"" of the human body. It is something that all humans have, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our parents, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Mr. Mendel discovered why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things called ""genes"" in our body. In 1953, two scientists, Watson and Crick, found out that genes are really messages. They're written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, another two scientists found the first ""word"" that they could understand in that language. It shows how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. So far, scientists have found all the words in the DNA map, but we still don't understand what they all do. By understanding what just one ""word"" means, we can help to save people from several illnesses. So the more we understand, the more doctors will be able to do. Most people hope that this will help to make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when we learn more ""words"" and find out more information, we will use it in the wrong way.

Design is Liu' s favorite, but for other students the electives are interesting lessons which relieve the pressures of schoolwork.Some students, for example, are learning how to play bridge.Chen Xi,15, is one of them.She said, ""Many people think that playing a card game like this in class is a waste of time.But in fact, bridge is a very challenging game that helps develop memory and math skills."" </s>"	playing a card game </s>
"Question: The passage is mainly about _ . Context: As I was thinking about language learning the other day, the image of baking bread came into my mind. I compared some of the exercises and drills that we put ourselves through in order to learn a language to the various ingredients that go into baking a loaf of fresh bread. Real language learning takes place in human relationships. No one sits down and eats a cup of flour, even if he is hungry and in a hurry. You don't become bilingual by learning lists of vocabulary. You don't become a speaker of a language by memorizing verb conjugations and agreement rules. You become bilingual by entering a community that uses that other language as its primary means of communication. I am not suggesting that we can make bread without ingredients. Flour is necessary, as are yeast , salt, water and other ingredients. Vocabulary is part of any language and will have to be learned. Grammatical rules exist in every language and cannot be ignored. But merely combining the appropriate ingredients in the recommended proportions does not result in bread. At best, you only end up with a ball of dough . In order to get bread, you have to apply heat to the dough. And in language learning, that heat comes from the community. Anyone who has learned a second language has experienced that heat. It creeps up your neck when you ask the babysitter, ""Have you already been eaten?"" when you meant to say, ""Have you already eaten?"" When you try to say something quite innocent and the whole room bursts into laughter, you are experiencing the heat that turns raw dough into good bread. Remember the old saying, ""If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen""? This is where language learning often breaks down because we find the heat uncomfortable and we stop the baking process. In order words, we can't stand the heat, so we get out of the kitchen. However, the language learner who stays in the kitchen--in the heat--until the combined ingredients are thoroughly transformed will enjoy the richness of a quality loaf of bread. He is lad that he did not ""get out of the kitchen"" at the critical moment when the oven seemed too hot. The dedicated language learner knows that becoming bilingual cannot be achieved without the heat! </s>"	"what an important role ""heat"" plays in learning a language </s>"
"Question: According to the text, hurricanes usually _ . Context: Many people like the feeling of the gentle wind in spring. Many like to see the falling leaves dancing in the wind in autumn. But sometimes, when the wind becomes a storm, it can be very destructive . A series of such storms struck the US last month and caused very serious damage and human pain. Every year, major storms cause many problems around the world. There is nothing people can do to stop these powerful forces of nature. But new techniques are helping scientists to predict how, when, and where big storms will happen. The more exact scientists' warnings are, the better people can prepare for the storms. Predictions are improving. ""We've gotten better over the years, especially the last few years,"" says Phil Klotzback, a scientist at an American university. How is a storm formed? Even if scientists know where a storm will happen, winds can suddenly change, carrying the storm to a new direction. ""For a hurricane to happen, conditions have to be just right,"" Klotzback says. First, the ocean water needs to be warm enough so that it _ and rises into the air. As it rises, the air containing drops of water cools and turns back into liquid. This process gives off heat. This produces energy like an engine that causes winds to increase. It drives the formation of a hurricane. If wind speeds reach 40 miles per hour, the system is called a "" tropical storm"", and it gets a name. At 75 miles per hour, it becomes a hurricane. Hurricanes that hit the US start when a thunderstorm forms off the coast Africa. Storms also develop over tropical waters in other parts of the world. On average, 60 or 70 storms form off Africa every year. About 10 of them get names. There are usually about six hurricanes. Two tend to be very big, with winds of 115 miles per hour or a bit higher. The hurricane season lasts from June to November. Ninety percent of all hurricanes hit in August, September and October. </s>"	hit parts of the world in summer and autumn </s>
"Question: What is the attitude of the author's family toward his plan? Context: I was desperately nervous about becoming car-free. But eight months ago our car was hit by a passing vehicle and it was destroyed. No problem, I thought: we'll buy another. But the insurance payout didn't even begin to cover the costs of buying a new car--I worked out that, with the loan we'd need plus petrol, insurance, parking permits and tax, we would make a payment as much as PS600 a month. And that's when I had my fancy idea. Why not just give up having a car at all? I live in London. We have a railway station behind our house, a tube station 10 minutes' walk away, and a bus stop at the end of the street. A new car club had just opened in our area, and one of its shiny little red Peugeots was parked nearby. If any family in Britain could live without a car, I reasoned, then surely we were that family. But my new car-free idea, sadly, wasn't shared by my family. My teenage daughters were horrified. What would their friends think about our family being ""too poor to afford a car""? (I wasn't that bothered what they thought, and I suggested the girls should take the same approach.) My friends, too, were astonished at our plan. What would happen if someone got seriously ill overnight and needed to go to hospital? (an ambulance) How would the children get to and from their many events? (buses and trains) People smiled as though this was another of my mad ideas, before saying they were sure I'd soon realize that a car was a necessity. Eight months on, I wonder whether we'll ever own a car again. The idea that you ""have to"" own a car, especially if you live in a city, is all in the mind. I live--and many other citizens do too--in a place that has never been better served by public transport, and yet car ownership has never been higher. We worry about rising car costs, but we'd be better off asking something much more basic: do I really need a car? Certainly the answer is no, and I'm a lot richer because I dared to ask the question. </s>"	Disapproving. </s>
"Question: The writer thinks that _ . Context: In England, Christmas is the most important holiday in the year. Two important things, apart from its religious significance, help to set this holiday apart from all others: the custom of giving presents and the habit of spending it with the family. In the present highly commercialized age we are reminded of Christmas many weeks before the event. In the shops the special Christmas displays appear and outside them the special Christmas decorations. In the shopping centers of very large towns decorations are put up in the streets. In London thousands of people crowded into the centre of the town to see the decorations. The advertisements in all the newspapers remind us every day that there are ""Only X more shopping days to Christmas"". The Post Office vans are covered with brightly color1ed pictures advising us to ""Post Early for Christmas"", for hundred of millions of Christmas cards and millions of parcels are sent every year. Everywhere one turns, one is made aware that Christmas, which comes ""but once a year"", is coming once again. Many people feel sorrow about what they consider the over-commercialization of a sacred holiday, but, underneath all the business activities, a great deal of Christmas spirit is to be found. The custom of giving presents to one's family and friends is a very pleasant one so long as one remembers that it is the spirit behind the present which matters most and not the present itself. And how good it is at Christmas to return to the family home and meet parents, grandparents and as many aunts, uncles and cousins as can be expected to meet. Without the modern means of transport, however, many families would have the Christmas reunion. </s>"	people can feel the existence of Christmas spirit anyhow </s>
Question: What is the author's attitude towards using robots in factories? Context: I visited the nearby car factory today with my uncle, who works there. One thing I noticed was that most of the work is now done by robots. Welding , painting, testing, and many other jobs are performed by robots now. The whole dashboard of the car is now put into the car from above, through the windshield, by a robot. It would have taken two men to do this in the past, and it would have hurt their backs quite a bit. It got me thinking: is it a good thing that robots are replacing factory workers? On one hand, robots generally do a more accurate job than people. They aren't likely to make many mistakes, and if something goes wrong with one car, an alarm goes off. They do exactly the same thing, every time, without fail. A human worker is never able to do exactly the same thing every time. On the other hand, robots also reduce costs for companies. Companies don't have to pay robots wages or injury compensation if they're broken. If something in a robot does go wrong, it won't have to take time off work for a year, or even forever, as could happen to a real person if he breaks his back or burn himself while welding. The obvious _ to all of this is that it increases the unemployment rate.The company will have to bring in some very talented individuals who know how to operate the robots. Unlike regular factory workers, these intelligence workers usually demand a higher pay. </s>	The text doesn't mention it. </s>
"Question: The hardest thing in preparing for his Italian trip was _ . Context: In the summer of 2011 my friend and I decided to go to Italy for a holiday and we decided to travel there without going through a travel agency. You know, you would not be seen among the tourists and lose lots of chances to get familiar with the country more closely. We started to think over our trip and tried to come up with a free tour to Italy. The trip was not very long but it was so exciting that we never forgot. We look forward to going there again! Of course, we spent lots of time arranging the trip, but it was well worth it! Of course I was afraid that something would go wrong and I was especially worried about my visa, but everything went quite well in the end. The most difficult part was getting a visa without an invitation. In the Italian consulate , one must hand in some official paper proving that one has a hotel booked for oneself in order to get the visa. Then we had to solve the ticket problem. Airlines often sell cheap tickets and we bought ours far earlier. The next step was to book a hotel. We finally booked a hotel about 30 km away from the centre of Rome and it was the perfect choice for our trip. Every day we took a train that carried us to the centre of Rome. Our big house was among the forest. The beautiful views, nice hosts, comfortable living conditions made us happy to no end. Besides this, we were very lucky that our hostess was Russian. She gave us a lot of advice that was of great use. She told us what transport to choose and where the best places to go. Don't be afraid to arrange your trip by yourself. It's not difficult! The only thing I'll say right now is that we really enjoy travelling by ourselves. We walked with a map and a guide-book wherever we wanted to go and we even met some of our countrymen on the way just two or three times. So, if you're also planning a ""single"" trip, don't forget to take a Russian-Italian phrasebook as people in Italy prefer to speak in their local language. </s>"	getting a visa from the Italian consulate without an invitation </s>
"Question: Kipling first left his parents in _ . Context: Joseph Rudyard Kipling, who enjoyed early success with his poems, was born on 30 December 1865 in Bombay, India. Some of Kipling's earliest and fondest memories are of his and sister Alice's trips to the fruit market with their woman servant, or walking with his parents alongside the sea at night. The beautiful days were to end when in 1871 Rudyard and Alice were sent to school in Southsea, England, to live with Captain Holloway and his wife. She ruled the boarding house with punishment and Kipling was often beaten by her and her son. ""Then the old Captain died, and I was sorry, for he was the only person in that house as far as I can remember who ever threw me a kind word."" So he wrote in his later books. Kipling soon learned to read and found comfort in literature and poetry. Freedom from the Holloway household was gained when he spent one month a year in London with his mother's kind sister Aunt Georgie and her husband, pre-Raphaelite painter Edward Burne Jones and their children. _ In 1877 Kipling's mother returned to England and collected him so that he could attend the United Services College in Devon. Now he was able to settle into the life of a student and in his second year started writing his own Schoolboy Lyric poems printed by his parents. In 1878 his father took him to the Paris Exhibition where he was allowed to wander freely and gained much appreciation for French culture which he wrote about in ""Souvenirs of France"". </s>"	1871 </s>

Question: Which is true of the following statements? Context: Scientists are learning new things about Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth. For example, the Antarctic ice sheet is shrinking. A new study found that summer ice loss in parts of Antarctica was at its highest level in 1,000 years. The study showed that Antarctic ice was melting mostly from below ice shelves, where the water is warmer than the ice. Eric Rignot is an earth system expert at the University of California, Irvine. He also works for the American space agency, NASA. There he serves as senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also in California. He says ice melting from below is responsible for 55 percent of the shelf loss from 2003 to 2008. That is a much higher rate than scientists thought earlier. Professor Rignot and his team used satellite observations, radar and computer models to measure features above the ice to learn what was going on below. The measurements show differences from one area to the next around the continent. The major ice shelves are called Ross, Filchner and Ronne. They make up two-thirds of Antarctica's ice shelves. But they are responsible for only 15 percent of the melting ice. The professor says even small changes, like changes in ocean flow driven by wind, can make a huge difference in the melting of the ice shelf. Sixty percent of the Earth's fresh water is held in the huge Antarctic ice sheet. Professor Rignot says the study will help experts predict how the continent reacts to warmer ocean waters and helps to cause rising sea levels around the world. The study was published in the journal Science. </s>	Sixty percent of the Earth's fresh water is contained in the huge Antarctic ice sheet. </s>

Question: Home economics _ . Context: Nobody likes home economics . But restoring the program could help us in the fight against obesity and chronic diseases today. The home economics movement was founded on the belief that housework and food preparation were important subjects that should be studied scientifically. The first classes occurred in the agricultural and technical colleges that were built in the 1860s. When most departments of universities rejected women, home economics was a back door into higher education. Indeed, in the early 20th century, home economics was a serious subject When few people understood germ theory and almost no one had heard of vitamins, home economics classes offered vital information about washing hands regularly, eating fruits and vegetables and not feeding coffee to babies. However, today we remember only the fixed ideas about home economics, forgetting the movement's most important lessons on healthy eating and cooking. Too many Americans simply don't know how to cook. Our diets, consisting of highly processed foods made cheaply outside the home, have contributed to many serious health problems. In the last decade, many cities and states have tried to tax junk food heavily or to ban the use of food stamps to buy soda. Clearly, many people are doubtful about any governmental steps to promote healthy eating. But what if the government put the tools of obesity prevention in the hands of children themselves by teaching them how to cook? My first experience with home economics happened two decades ago when I was a seventh grader in a North Carolina public school. A year later, my father's job took our family to Wales, where I attended a large school for a few months. It was the first time I had ever really cooked anything. I remember that it was fun, and with an instructor standing by, it wasn't hard. Those lessons stuck with me when I first started cooking for my husband and myself after college and they still do. Teaching cooking in public schools can help solve some problems facing Americans today. The history of home economics shows it's possible. </s>	once offered women a. special approach to university education </s>

I couldn't reach anyone to pick me up, so I decided to take a bus. Not knowing the routes, I thought I'd just go east. A bus stopped. I got on and asked the driver how far she was going, ""Ten more miles,"" she said. There was another bus I could take from there. This clearly was going to be a long night. I got off at the end of the route and she told me which bus to look for. After waiting 30 minutes, I began to think about a very expensive taxi ride home. Then a bus came up. There was no lighted number above its windshield. It was out of service, but the door opened. It was the same driver. ""I just can't leave you here,"" she said. ""This isn't the nicest place.

"Question: A person's choice of a particular hotel is made mainly according to_. Context: How do you think of the following example? Many Japanese never take the vacations they should enjoy, but with the coming of ""Golden Week"", several holidays following one after another in late April and early May, they pour out of the country in the tens of thousands. So when traveling, whether on business or for pleasure, the first thing to think about are hotels. The kind of hotel you choose is decided according to how much money you want to spend. There are small hotels with very few services, where the prices are low, or there are large hotels with all the very latest comforts, where you could spend all the money you have in the bank for a very comfortable night. There are several different kinds of people who go to hotels. Some want to live, rather than just stay, in a hotel; hotels which are designed to meet their needs are called residential hotels. However, most people who stay in hotels are either business people or tourists on holiday. In most hotels, there are two kinds of rooms: single rooms, for the use of one person, and double rooms, for the use of two people. In addition, in large hotels, there are also suites , which include two or more rooms connected together -- perhaps a bedroom and a living room.

"Question: The Center for UFO Studies _ . Context: For thousands of years, people have seen things they didn't understand in the sky. The United States Air Force first used the words ""Unidentified Flying Object"" to describe them. Today everyone uses the term UFO. When people see a UFO, it is usually no more than a weather balloon or an airplane. But the Center for UFO Studies goes on to receive hundreds of reports each year. In 1947 a businessman and pilot, Kenneth Arnold, was flying near Mount Rainier, Washington when he saw nine shiny, round objects flying through the air. He told a newspaper reporter they looked like ""pie plates skipping over water."" The reporter used the words ""flying saucer "" in his story and today that is the popular name for UFOs. The Center for UFO Studies lists three kinds of contacts with flying saucers. ""Encounters of the first kind"" are reports of unknown objects or lights in the sky. People have ""Encounters of the second kind"" when a UFO leaves burn marks or other signs on the ground. People report ""Close encounters of the third kind"" when they see aliens in or near a UFO. </s>"	receive hundreds of reports every year </s>
Question: What does the writer think of the change and development of language? He thinks it is _ . Context: Language is always changing and developing. This isn't a bad thing. If English hadn't changed for a long time, we won't have words to describe telephones, washing machines, computers or some other new things. Language changes for several reasons. First, it changes because the needs of its speaker change. New technologies, new products, and new experiences need new words to express them clearly. Another reason for change is that different people have different language experiences. People use different sets of words and expressions, because they have different ages, jobs, education levels and so on. How does language develop then? On the one hand, many of the languages changes begin with young people. When young people communicate with others of their own age, their language grows in grammar, words and expressions that are different from the older people's. Some have a short lifetime but others can influence the language for long. On the other hand, we get new words in many different ways. We borrow them from other languages, we create them by making words shorter or combining words and we make them out of proper names. Languages that don't change over time are considered dead languages. The fact that English changes so much shows that it is alive and well. </s>	not a bad thing </s>

I quickly reached for my wallet and said,"" Suppose we check again, just in case you do have enough money for the doll."" ""OK, I hope I do have enough,"" he said.I put some of my money with his without him seeing and we started to count it.There was enough for the doll and even some spare money.

During Mo's teenage years, with a series of political campaigns from theGreat Leap Forwardto theCultural Revolutiongoing on, his access to literature was limited to novels in thesocialist realiststyle under Mao Zedong, which centered largely on the themes of class struggle and conflict. At the close of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Mo joined in the People's Liberation Army(PLA), and began writing while he was still a soldier. He began his career as a writer in thereform and opening upperiod, publishing dozens of short stories and novels in Chinese. His first novel was Falling Rain on a Spring Night, published in 1981.

He published his firstnovella , A Transparent Radish in 1984, and released Red Sorghum in 1986, launching his career as a nationally recognized novelist. In 1991, he obtained a master's degree in Literature from Beijing Normal University. ""Mo Yan"" -- meaning ""don't speak"" in Chinese -- is his pen name. In an interview, he explained the name came from a warning from his father and mother not to speak his mind while outside, because of China's revolutionary political situation from the 1950s, when he grew up. Mo Yan's Red Sorghum Clan is about the generations of a Shandong family between 1923 and 1976.

"Question: As people grow older, they _ Context: When asked about happiness, we usually think of something extraordinary, an delight, which seems to get rarer the older we get. For kids, happiness has a magical quality. Their delight at winning a race or getting a new bike is unreserved . In the teenage years the concept of happiness changes. Suddenly it's conditional on such things as excitement, love and popularity. I can still recall the excitement of being invited to dance with the most attractive boy at the school party. In adulthood the things that bring deep joy----love, marriage, birth----also bring responsibility and the risk of loss. For adults, happiness is complicated My definition for happiness is ""the capacity for enjoyment"". The more we can enjoy what we have, the happier we are. It's easy to overlook the pleasure we get from the company of friends, the freedom to live where we pleased, and even good health. I experienced my little moments of pleasure yesterday. First I was overjoyed when I shut the last lunch-box and had the house to myself. Then I spent an uninterrupted morning writing, which I love. When the kids and my husband came home, I enjoyed their noise after the quiet of the day. Psychologists tell us that to be happy we need a mix of enjoyable leisure time and satisfying work. I don't think that my grandmother, who raised 14 children, had much of either. She did have a network of close friends and family, and maybe this is what satisfied her. We, however, with so many choices and such pressure to succeed in every area, have turned happiness into one more thing we've got to have. We've so self-conscious about our ""right"" to it that it's making us miserable. So we pursue it and equal it with wealth and success, without noticing that the people who have those things aren't necessarily happier Happiness isn't about what happens to us----it's about how we see what happens to us. It's the skillful way of finding a positive for every negative. It's not wishing for what we don't have, but enjoying what we do own. </s>"	feel it harder to experience happiness </s>
Question: What is the largest source of the visitors to Hong Kong? Context: The tourism business in Hong Kong has been through some very hard times. Ten years ago, with all the economic problems in Asia, far fewer tourists were visiting Hong Kong. However, the SAR was still one of the most popular destinations in Asia, and a favored location for international meetings and exhibitions. The year 1997 was the best year for tourism in the 1990s. However in 1998, the figure was down by 8% from 10.4 million tourist arrivals recorded in the previous year. Tourism was still big business, though. The mainland was Hong Kong's largest source of visitors, making up over a quarter of all arrivals. Travelers from Taiwan Province, South and Southeast Asia and Japan made up the most of other visitors. Tourism remained a major source of foreign exchange, although tourists spending dropped. Tourists often made short visits, staying an average of three to four days. Most tourists came to Hong Kong for business or leisure , or a mixture of both. Shopping was still the favorite thing of tourist activity and spending. The average visitor spent about HK$ 3,000 - not including accommodation and food. Hong Kong Tourist Association officials developed various plans to develop interest in Hong Kong as a tourist destination, and they hoped these policies would work. </s>	The mainland of China </s>
"Question: What does the author realize at Mount Rushmore? Context: ""Dad,"" I say one day, ""let's take a trip. Why don't you fly out and meet me?"" My father had just retired after 27 years as a manager for IBM. His job filled his day, his thought, his life. While he woke up and took a warm shower, I screamed under a freezing waterfall in Peru. While he tied a tie and put on the same Swiss watch, I rowed a boat across Lake of the Ozarks. My father sees me drifting aimlessly, nothing to show for my 33 years but a passport full of funny stamps. He wants me to settle down, but now I want him to find an adventure. He agrees to travel with me through the national parks. We meet four weeks later in Rapid City. "" What is our first stop?"" asks my father. ""What time is it?"" ""Still don't have a watch?"" Less than an hour away is Mount Rushmore. As he stares up at the four Presidents carved in granite , his mouth and eyes open slowly, like those of a little boy. ""Unbelievable,"" he says, ""How was this done?"" A film in the information center shows sculptor Gutzon Borglum devoted 14 years to the sculpture and then left the final touches to his son. We stare up and I ask myself, Would I ever devote my life to anything? No directions, no goals. I always used to hear those words in my father's voice. Now I hear them in my own. The next day we're at Yellowstone National Park, where we have a picnic. ""Did you ever travel with your dad?"" I ask. ""Only once,"" he says. ""I never spoke much with my father. We loved each other--but never said it. Whatever he could give me, he gave."" _ In Glacier National Park, my father says, ""I've never seen water so blue.""

"Question: How did the RSPB assess the level of nature connection among children? Context: Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) suggests. The three-year project found that only 21 % of children aged 8 --12 were ""connected to nature"". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what ""connected to nature"" actually means and then deve -loped a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1, 200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21 % of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This ""realistic and achievable"" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organization. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27 % of girls were at or above the ""realistic and achievable"" target, only 16 % of boys were at the same level. ""We need to understand these differences,"" Sue Armstrong Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC New. ""Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyze the data to find that out."" The report also stressed significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. </s>"	By carrying out a survey. </s>

Recently, the American star won Best Actress at this year's Academy Awards for her role in the film The Silver Linings Playbook. According to Time magazine's Richard Corliss, Lawrence is that rare young actress who ""lends a mature intelligence to any role"". Though Lawrence has found great success through her big screen work, Lawrence wasn't sure what she really liked doing before the age of 14. She thought she'd go to college and maybe find a career as a doctor or a travel agent. Lawrence's two brothers were star athletes and one of them was a straight-A student. Unlike them, she suffered through school, never quite finding where she belonged. However, during a trip to New York, Lawrence suddenly realized that she wanted to be an actress. When she was enjoying the beautiful city, a model seeker asked if he could take her picture, and the next day he called her in for an audition . ""I read the script and it was the first time I had that feeling like I understand this,"" Lawrence said. ""Within 20 minutes, in the cab ride from the hotel room, I decided I didn't want to be a model. In fact, I wanted to be an actress."" Having appreciated this young lady's performance, the agency was so impressed with her reading that they signed her on the spot. But she insisted on finishing high school so she could give her full attention to her acting career. Lawrence burst onto the Hollywood scene last year with The Hunger Games, which established her as the highest-grossing female action hero of all time. Rolling Stone called her""the most talented young actress in America"". </s>"	talent </s>
"Question: What life lesson does this text teach us?

He was telling whoever he was talking with something about ""a thousand marbles"". I was _ and stopped to listen to what he had to say ... ""Let me tell you something, Tom, something that has helped me keep a good perspective on my own priorities ."" He continued, ""You see, I sat down one day and did a little math. The average person lives for about seventy-five years. Now then, I multiplied 75 by 52 and I came up with 3,900 which is the number of Saturdays that the average person has in their entire lifetime. Now stick with (......) me, Tom. I'm getting to the important part."" ""It wasn't until I had lived through over twenty-eight hundred Saturdays that I started thinking about all this in any detail,"" he went on. ""I got to thinking that if I lived to be seventy-five, I only had about a thousand of them left to enjoy. So I went to a toy store and bought 1,000 marbles. I took them home and put them inside a large, clear plastic container. Every Saturday since then, I have taken one marble out and thrown it away. ""I found that by watching the marbles diminish , I focused more on the really important things in life. There is nothing like watching your time here on this earth run out to help get your priorities straight. ""It was nice to meet you, Tom. I hope you spend time with your family, and I hope to meet you again."" You could have heard a pin drop on the radio when the old man signed off. I guess he gave us all a lot to think about.

Question: The reading mainly tells us something about _ . Context: If you knew a bottle of water had been recycled from urine , would you drink it? Astronauts at the International Space Station (ISS) may soon do so. NASA said it would use a high-tech machine to recycle wastewater at the ISS. The machine will recycle everything from sweat , the water for washing hands, shower water, water used for brushing teeth, and even urine, to make drinking water. It will save NASA millions of dollars each year. At present, each ISS astronaut uses about 4.4 liters of water every day. It costs about $24 million a year to transport water up to ISS. NASA says that a liter of water costs about $11,000. The machine will be sent to the ISS in October 2008. NASA hopes it will recycle about 93% of all water used on the station. Will the water be clean? Scientists say the wastewater will go through a very complicated process . For example, different chemicals will be put in the wastewater; the water will be heated to 130degCto get rid of bacteria . The recycled water is thousands of times better than the water from a city tap, scientists say. </s>	a high-tech machine </s>
"Question: The author is probably _ . Context: Some people would have you believe that being fat is the worst thing you can be. They think that if a person is fat they have no life, no love, no reason to want to look good in their clothes. The sad thing is that many people who are fat do feel the same loathing toward themselves and others who are overweight or obese. I know what I'm talking about because I have been there. I have been that fat girl who wore big T-shirts to cover my ""sins"". Forget style. Forget fashion sense. I absolutely had none. I didn't even bother getting haircuts for years, just wore my hair long and straight, pulled back in a ponytail, I have to wonder if the reason the fashion industry has ignored plus sized women and children for so long is because plus sized people, feeling they couldn't possibly look great, didn't bother shopping for new clothes, and therefore no profit was to be found by producing those sizes. For me, the change that improved my outer look actually started with my outlook on life. I started by being grateful for all I do have, like great health, a stable family, a steady income, freedom, a decent home, the ability to see the trees turn orange in the fall, to hear my grandson humming in the back seat, to remember the great times I've had in my life. I started to focus on all the positive aspects of the life I already had. I actually started to feel the beauty of the Universe all around me and to realize that I am part of that perfection. The self loathing stopped. I noticed all the people in my life who loved me in spite of my size. I got off the pity pot and smiled at myself.

"Question: What is the passage mainly about ? Context: A peer is a person who is about the same age as you. Peers affect your life, whether you know it or not, just by spending time with you. Peers can have a good effect on one another. Maybe another student in your science class taught you an easy way to remember the planets in solar system. Maybe you got others excited about your new favorite book and now everyone's reading it. However, sometimes peers affect one another in another way. For example, one kid in school might try to get another to cut class with him, your soccer friend might try to persuade you to be mean to another player and never pass her the ball, or a kid in the neighborhood might want you to with him. Some kids give in to peer pressure because they want to be liked, to fit in, or because they worry that other kids may make fun of them if they don't go along with the group. Others may go along because they are curious to try something new that others are doing. The idea that "" everyone's doing it"" may influence some kids to leave their better judgments or their common senses behind. Peer pressure can be extremely strong and hard to get rid of. Experiments have shown how peer pressure can influence someone to change her/ his mind from what she/ he knows for sure is a correct answer to the incorrect answer----just because everyone else gives the incorrect answer! That holds true for people of any age in peer pressure situations. It can be hard to walk away from peer pressure, but it can be done.

Inner strength and self- confidence can help you stand firm, walk away and resist doing something when you know better. </s>"	Peer pressure </s>
"Question: What is the best title of this passage? Context: As we all know, getting benched in sports is usually a bad thing. But at one school in Florida, a girl has taken a bench and turned it into something entirely different - a place to find friends. It's called the Friendship Bench. And it's the brainchild of a sixth grader at Palm Bay Elementary - a girl named Acacia Woodley. Acacia's attitude toward life might be summed up best by a question she recently asked members of the Brevard County School Board - ""what if we spend as much time putting the spotlight on kindness as we do on cruelty?"" It's a philosophy Acacias has learned to live her own life -despite having a lot of people would consider a handicap. She was born without a right hand. And her left hand did not form properly. But Acacia says that she has not stopped her from achieving her goals. ""You need to believe in your dreams. If you don't believe in you dreams, I can definitely tell you that they are not going to come true."" She said. Acacia came up with the idea for the Friendship Bench after seeing kids getting bullied at school. She says she has also experienced bullying herself - kids whispering about her or picking on her because she is different. ""Some people say they feel sorry for me. I tell them not to,"" she said. ""I don't care that I'm different. I like being different."" The Friendship Bench looks like a lot of other benches. It has arm sets and a place to lean on. But there are also words painted on it - words such as ""hope"", ""respect"", ""listen"" and ""dream"". Acacia put the benches together with the help from her mother and brother. Any time a kid feels he or she needs a friend, all that kid needs to do is sit on the bench. It is then up to the other kids - or grown-ups - to fill that need. ""It's a perfect idea,"" Palm Bay Elementary Principal Lori said. ""It's something we've needed so badly.""

"Question: What is the passage mainly about? Context: A Nepalese teenager had made a PS 23 solar panel ( ) using human hair. Milan Karki, who is 18 years old and lives in a village, used human hair to replace silicon, which is a common but expensive part of solar panels.

Question: .Which of the following can best serves as the title of this passage? Context: This morning, a Virgin Atantin 747 Jumbo Jet became the first commercial airplane to fly on biofuel. The short flight from London to Amsterdam used a blend of 20% babassu oil mixed with 80% conventional jet fuel. What was really exciting about the flight was the fact that the engine did not have to be altered in any way for the biofuel to work While this is a great initial step in trying to reduce CO2(carbon-dioxide)emissions from airplanes. there are a lot of hurdles that still need to be overcome. First and foremost, unlike the normal fuel used to run airplanes (known as Jet A),biofuel freezes at high altitudes. Also, Jet'A'fuel burns consistently (at the same pace),which means it provides a safe and reliable fuel for long flights--engineers are not sure if biofuel will be able to do the same. The biggest hurdle to a full biofuel switch is our ability to be able to grow enough crops that can be converted to biofuel. There are two concerns that scientists have in this matter - the first is that the land to grow the extra crops will come from clearing more of our forests and the second is that since it competes with what we eat, the price of food will go up. However, Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines, envisions that if biofuel starts to replace oil on a greater basis, it will be manufactured from algae produced in sewage treatment plants, not from food sources. Birgin Airlines is not the only one trying to look for alternative fuel sources. Earlier this year, an Airbus A380 used another alternative fuel-a man-made mix of gas-to-liquid, in one of its four engines. The flight was tested by Rolls Royce (manufacturer of jet engines), in partnership with Shell (an oil company). Rolls Royce is also working with Air New Zealand on a similar project. While a complete switch to alternative fuel may take years, it is very encouraging to see airlines, oil companies and airplane manufacturers all coming together to try to make it happen! </s>	The First Commercial Flight Powered by Biofuel. </s>

Question: What do we know about Dr. Tisman? Context: Dr. Glenn Tisman, a cancer specialist, knew his young neighbor, Ray Bateman, had an unusual mind. But he had no idea at the time that 12 - year - old Ray had the ability to become his partner in cancer research. Ray's parents remembered that at age four, Ray surprised them by fixing a broken vacuum cleaner . When he was ten, he speedily constructed the family color television from a kit. Later, he succeeded in assembling a complex stereo system after two experts had failed to do the job. When Ray was ten, he convinced his parents to buy him a computer. In a short time, Ray was able to do amazing things with the computer. Ray shared his enthusiasm for computers with Dr. Tisman, who used a computer for his research. The two discussed computers and medicine frequently. Amazingly, Ray understood the biology and chemistry related to Dr. Tisman's medical research without any previous instruction. Ray then worked with Dr. Tisman after school. He helped conduct research with the equipment and kept it in working order. The purpose of the research was to test the effectiveness of mixing an old cancer drug with certain vitamins. Ray analyzed patient test results by computer, while Dr. Tisman handled all patient contact. Together, they came up with solid research that helped advance cancer treatment.

"Question: When Banks was young _ ;. Context: Joseph Banks was born in 1743,the only son of a wealthy land-owning family. From an early age, he was interested in natural history, and in particular, botany. In the early 1760 's he chose to make this dream to the full.

They made collections and observations in South America, Tahiti and New Zealand before reaching Australia. His major landfalls on the eastern coast of Australia were at Botany Bay and at the Endeavor River. He thought collection of plants was grown so large that it was necessary that some extraordinary care should be taken of them in case they should destroy. The plant material collected and sorted on the voyage was huge, with the herbarium specimens about 1300 new species. After returning from this voyage, Banks travelled to Scotland, Wales, Holland and Iceland, collecting more and more _ . Among many other activities, without thinking running out of his money, he controlled the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and was a Trustee of the British Museum.
