What might be the best title?	"Don't be afraid! We are not encouraging people to steal. It's one of the most popular topics currently talked about by people in cities, together with, ""How many vegetables did you steal today?""or, ""It's harvest time for your peaches,"" and, ""I bought you a new car today."" Listening to a conversation like this, you do not have to feel strange. These people don't really have their own farms or so much money that they can casually buy someone else a car. They are just playing games on Social Networking Sites(SNS) like kaixing001.com. Can you imagine millions of people in China spending lots of time on SNS playing games and talking to friends? This is especially true of white-collar workers in cities, Take kaixing001.com for example --the number of current members has already hit 38 million. However, the large number of people using SNS highlights another problem. That is, lots of people choose to escape from reality, NSN just offers them a virtual environment where they can escape from reality. Different games provide netizens with different experiences: dreaming, chatting and playing. It offers people the opportunity to escape from reality. But the virtual world is not the real one; no one can live in _ forever, and reality is not as surfing on the Internet. Since this kind of social networking sites have become so popular, people have started to think about moving it into the real world. And so far as we know, a farmland of this kind exists in Shanghai where it has reached its first base. After playing the ""Happy Farm""game on kaixing001.com, would you like to put yourself among the real world while smelling the fragrances of the countryside? Recently a farmland service called ""Happy Farm in Reality"" was opened in the suburbs of Shanghai where white-collar workers can experience the real farmers' for themselves."

Who was Tom Parker?	"One of the most popular American singers of the twentieth century was Elvis Presley. He made the rock & roll music popular all over the world. He sold millions of records and made many successful films, and he helped change the direction of popular music in the 1960 s. Elvis Presley was born in a poor family in 1935. His parents were simple country people who often took him to church, where he learned to sing, and he never forgot the kind of songs that he used to sing in church as a child. When he was young, Elvis moved from Toledo to Memphis in Tennessee, where he attended high school. But he was not a good student. His only real interest was singing. He began to sing in the style that is called ""country and western"". In 1955 he recorded some songs for his mother's birthday. The people at the recording studio liked his singing and his music. It was country and western music, but it also sounded a little like the music which black people used to sing in the American South. It was called ""blues"". Shortly after that, Elvis met Tom Parker, who became his manager and arranged concerts for him across the United States and new recordings as well. Soon Elvis became famous around the country. Later Elvis went to Hollywood and began to appear in films such as Love Me Tender and King Creole. But Elvis found it difficult to live with success.

Why did man have a desire to explore again?	There have been many great inventions that changed the way we live.The first great invention was one that is still very important today--the wheel.This made it easier to carry heavy things and to travel long distances.For hundreds of years after that there were few inventions that had as much effect as the wheel.Then in the early 1800's the world started to change.There was little unknown land left in the world.People did not have to explore much anymore.They began to work instead to make life better.In the second half of the 19th century many great inventions were made.Among them were the camera, the electric light and the radio.These all became a big part of our life today. The first part of the 20th century saw more great inventions.The helicopter in 1909.Movies with sound in 1926.The computer in 1928.And jet planes in 1930.This was also a time when a new material was first made.Nylon came out in 1935.It changed the kind of clothes people wear.The middle part of the 20th century brought new ways to help people get over disease. _ worked very well.They made people healthier and let them live longer lives.By the 1960's most people could expect to live to be at least 60.By this time most people had a very good life. Of course new inventions continued to be made.But man now had a desire to explore again.The world was known to man but the stars were not.Man began looking for ways to go into space.Russia made the first step.Then the United States took a step.Since then other countries, including China and Japan, have made their steps into space.In 1969 man took his biggest step away from the earth.Americans first walked on the moon.This is certainly just a beginning though. New inventions will someday allow us to do things we have never yet dreamed of.	['Going into space is a dream for man to realize.']
Why did Jimmy apply for a new job?	"Jimmy is an automotive mechanic, but he lost his job a few months ago. He has a good heart, but always feared applying for a new job. One day, he gathered up all his strength and decided to attend a job interview. His appointment was at 10 am and it was already 8:30. While waiting for a bus to the office where he was supposed to be interviewed, he saw an elderly man wildly kicking the tyre of his car. Obviously there was something wrong with the car. Jimmy immediately went up to lend him a hand. When Jimmy finished working on the car, the old man asked him how much he should pay for the service. Jimmy said there was no need to pay him; he just helped someone in need, and he had to rush for an interview. Then the old man said, ""Well, I could take you to the office for your interview. It's the least I could do. Please, I insist."" Jimmy agreed. Upon arrival, Jimmy found a long line of applicants waiting to be interviewed. Jimmy still had some grease on him after the car repair, but he did not have much time to wash it off or have a change of shirt. One by one, the applicants left the interviewer's office with disappointed look on their faces. Finally his name was called. The interviewer was sitting on a large chair facing the office window. Rocking the chair back and forth, he asked, ""Do you really need to be interviewed?"" Jimmy's heart sank. ""With the way I look now, how could I possibly pass this interview?"" he thought to himself. Then the interviewer turned the chair and to Jimmy's surprise, it was the old man he helped earlier in the morning. It turned out he was the General Manager of the company. ""Sorry I had to keep you waiting, but I was pretty sure I made the right decision to have you as part of our workforce before you even stepped into the office. I just know you'd be a trustworthy worker. Congratulations!"" Jimmy sat down and they shared a cup of well-deserved coffee as he landed himself a new job."	['He was out of work']
The passage mainly tells us _ .	What's a good friend like? One may have different answers to this question at different ages. When he is very young, he may think a good friend must be together with him all day. And they can share everything together. If his friend doesn't give him food to eat once, he doesn't think they are good friends any more. But they will play together happily again very soon. When he grows older and studies in a middle school, his idea about a good friend changes. He thinks a good friend should be helpful and honest. A good friend should always help him with his lessons. A good friend should come to him when he is sad. And he is always ready to tell everything to his friend. If his friend tells others about his secrets, he may hate the friend. When he grows up, he may not think it's necessary for a good friend to be always honest. Everyone has his secrets. If the truth may hurt the friend, it's better to keep it secret from him than tell him about it. And he may think a good friend can give him some good advice when he has problems. He comes to understand that he shouldn't just ask friends for help and that he should also learn to do something for his friends.	['what a good friend means for a person at different ages']

According to the passage, a private-enterprise economy is characterized by _ .	The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, market-oriented economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending their money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition with other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, largely determines how these goods and services are produced. Thus, in the American economic system it is the demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, that together determine what shall be produced and how resources are used to produce it. An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in response to demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the product is in short supply to the demand, the price will be bid up and some consumers will be eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a commodity results in reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered by seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the America economic system. The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individual are allowed to own productive resources (private property), and they are permitted to hire labor, gain control over natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In the American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of productive resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price of a product or to make a free contract with another private individual.

How did the test subjects show the caffeine ' s memory-strengthening effects?	"Caffeine not only gives us a daily jump start, but new research suggests it also can strengthen long-term memory. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, nearly 90 percent of people worldwide consume about 200 milligrams of caffeine each day. That' s equivalent to about one strong cup of coffee a day. Writing in "" Nature Neuroscience"" , Johns Hopkins University researchers say their findings show that caffeine strengthens certain memories for up t0 24 hours after being taken in. "" We've always known that caffeine has cognitive-enhancing effects , but its ,particular effects on strengthening memories and making them resistant to forgetting has never been examined in detail in humans, "" said senior author of the paper Michael Yassa. "" We re- port for the first time a specific effect of caffeine on reducing forgetting over 24 hours. "" Conducting a double-blind trial, the researchers worked with a test group of people who didn't regularly consume caffeinated products. Five minutes after studying a series of images, the test subjects were given either a placebo or a 200-milligram caffeine tablet. To check the caffeine levels of their test subjects, the research team took saliva samples from them before they took their tablets and again one, three and 24 hours after- wards. Both groups of test participants ( those who took the placebo and those who took the caffeine tablet) were tested the following day to see if they could recognize the images they' d seen the previous day. The test included showing the test subjects another series of images that included some new images , those that were shown the previous day, as well as other images that were similar, but not the same as those they had viewed earlier. The researchers found that more members of the group who were given the caffeine tablets were able to correctly identify some of the new images as "" similar"" to previously viewed images rather than incorrectly identifying them as the same. ""We also know that caffeine is associated with health and longevity and may havesome protective effects from cognitive decline like Alzheimer' s disease . "" said Yassa."

It can be inferred from the passage that _ .	"Olivia and Jack are the most popular names in Britain for babies born in 2008, according to a survey made by the website . Jack has been top for 14 years since it took over from Thomas. Grace -- made famous by the Hollywood star Grace Kelly -- slipped back into third place behind Ruby, the name of singer Charlotte Church's daughter. Summer climbed 28 places from 44th to 16th. Ava -- the name of singer Myleene Klass's daughter -- also leapt 15 places to 19th. The troubles of the singer Amy Winehouse perhaps had an effect on the popularity of the name. It dropped three places to 23rd. Rebecca is also on the wane , ranking 48th. So is Courtney, which ranked 88th.

What's the purpose of this passage?	The parents of a troubled teen may feel unsure as to whom to turn to in order to find help for their child. They may feel as if they have exhausted all of their options, and sometimes they are on the verge of giving up. But there is hope. Schools for troubled teens offer discipline and in some cases, drug treatment programs that can provide important life skills, and more importantly, a fresh start. The following is a list of the most effective types of schools for troubled teens. Not every facility is a match for every child, but by knowing the differences between them, parents can make a better educated decision about where to send their teenager. Boarding Schools When a child is unable to deal with the relative freedom of a standard school day, boarding schools might be a good choice. At boarding schools, the child lives in a dorm setting, where almost every minute of the day is scheduled by school administrators. Treatment Centers When a teenager has an addiction to drugs or alcohol, a residential center that specializes in young people is an outstanding way to help them break the cycle of addiction. Treatment centers feature individual and group counseling to help identify the root causes of the drug problem and help develop the life skills needed to stay clean when the program is over. Wilderness Programs Designed to help improve the discipline and self-reliance of the child, wilderness programs send kids back to nature. By placing them in a foreign and sometimes uncomfortable setting, wilderness programs hope to improve children's behavior. Programs generally include hikes, exercise programs and team building exercises. Boot Camps Boot camps are the most extreme style of school for troubled teens. These facilities are modeled after actual military boot camps, where the individual must get into shape, work as part of a team, and follow a long, hard set of rules and regulations. However, boot camps might not be the best choice for a teen with a drug addiction.	['To introduce schools for troubled teens.']
This passage is mainly about _ .	"Picture the scene: the battery on your mobile phone has run out. You can't make any calls for help and no one can contact you. You are all alone - well, not quite. Just reach into your pocket and take out a piece of sugar.Put it into the battery, wait a minute, and you're back on the phone. Thanks to a couple of American scientists, this situation could become real.Swadesh Chaudhuri and Derek Lovely have invented the ""bacteria battery"" - powered by bacteria that eats sugar and turns it into electricity. ""This is a special organism,"" Lovely said.""You ean harvest enough electricity to power a cell phone battery for about four days from a spoonful of sugar."" In the past, bacteria batteries have been expensive and not long-lasting. But this battery uses more efficient bacteria that can turn 80 percent of sugar into electrical energy. This is 30 percent more than similar batteries can manage. The bacteria battery could become as small as a household battery. It's also cheap and stable, as sugar can be taken from waste and crops. But the sugar to electricity process is slow: it could take weeks for the bacteria to digest a cup of sugar.And it produces ""greenhouse"" gases which pollute the environment. The scientists understand there is a lot more work to be done. ""It is still young,"" said Lovely.""Where we are now is where solar power was 20 0r 30 years ago."" But he believes the battery could be used in scientific equipment at the bottom of the ocean.Other ideas include using sugar in the blood to run medical devices in the human body, and taking sugar from animal waste to provide energy to power homes in rural areas."

The best title of the report is _ .	"Ou Pingqin was a teacher in a special school (for deaf and mute students) of Yangxin in Huangshi, who has recently been considered the Most Beautiful Teacher in China.

"What can probably be regarded as ""female "" subjects by boys and girls?"	"Scientists have tried to come up with biological explanations for the difference between boys and girls. However, none were believable enough to explain the general picture. As one scientist points out, ""There are slight genetic differences between the sexes at birth which may affect the subjects boys and girls choose. But the difficulty is that by the time children reach school age, there are so many other effects that it is almost impossible to tell whether girls are worse at science and maths, or they've been brought up to think of these subjects as boys' 'territory' "". Statistics show that in mathematics, at least, girls are equal to boys. A recent report suggests that girls only stop studying mathematics because of social attitudes. One of the reports' authors says, ""While it is socially unacceptable for people not to be able to read and write, it is sill acceptable for women to say that they are 'hopeless' at maths. Our research shows that, although girls get marks which are as good as the boys' , they have not been encouraged to do so."" The explanation for the difference, which is very clear during the teenage years, goes as far back as early childhood experiences. From their first days in nursery school, girls are not encouraged to work on their own or to complete tasks, although boys are. For example, boys and not girls, are often asked to 'help' with repair work. This encouragement leads to a way of learning how to solve problems later on in life. A further report on maths teaching shows that teachers seem to give more attention to boys than to girls. Most teachers who took part in the study admitted that they expect their male students to do better at mathematics and science subjects than their females students. All of this tends to encourage boys to work harder in these subjects, gives them confidence and makes them believe that they can succeed. Interestingly, both boys and girls tend to regard such 'male' subjects like mathematics and science as difficult. Yet it has been suggested that girls avoid mathematics courses, not because they are difficult, but for social reasons. Mathematics and science are mainly male subjects, and therefore, as girls become teenagers, they are less likely to take them up. Girls do not seem to want to be in open competition with boys. Neither do they want to do better than boys because they are afraid to appear less female and less attractive."	['English']
Where was Diao Weihao when the earthquake happened?	"Diao Weihao, a student who studies business English at the Chengdu campus of Sichuan International Studies University, was in his dormitory when the earthquake struck at 2:30 pm on Monday.

""It felt like our dormitory building was being hit by a tractor,"" recalled Diao. ""I wasn't afraid.. I was even excited and curious. Now, looking back, it was a scary experience."" Diao and his roommates kept their calm. They didn't try to get out of the building until the shaking stopped. They were on the fifth floor and they feared there might be trouble if they didn't remain calm. ""We've watched lots of disaster films, and that helped us keep cool,"" he said. ""Only one student sprained his ankle. He was escaping in a hurry. Most of us got outside quickly and safely."" They were surprised to see so many students outside. ""I began to realize then what had happened,"" he said. The college had warned them that in the event of an earthquake, they should leave the dormitory immediately. A few did rush in when it was safe to grab some clothes to keep warm. Without any tents or bedding, the students stayed on the football field for the whole night. Rain started falling in the morning, but the students all kept in good order. They simply chatted and shared their feelings and comforted each other. ""Our students seemed to have self-control,"" he said. ""I heard that hospitals in Chengdu have lots of injured people who jumped out of buildings."" Now, Diao is mostly worried about the people in Wenchuan County. ""It seems we won't be able to have classes in one or two day's time,"" said Diao. ""I want to become a volunteer at the damage-hit area, or donate my blood to the injured people in hospital. Also, I will write on my blog to keep people calm and encourage them to protect themselves during emergencies."" Since the university is close to Dujiangyan, Diao and his classmates are still forbidden to return to their dorms or classrooms. However, they can eat in the canteen and get information about other parts of Sichuan by reading the newspapers."	['He was in his dormitory']
What colour is Huahua?	I have two pets. They are Fly, a dog, and Huahua, a cat. Fly is brown and grey. He is naughty . He sometimes steals food in the kitchen.Once, when there was nobody at home, Fly pulled a piece of meat off the table. But he was not careful enough. The plate also fell to the floor. When I got home, I saw the broken plate all over the floor, so I became very angry. Fly was so afraid that he went back to his bed at once. Huahua is a white and yellow cat. She is not beautiful but she is very lovely. Every night at weekends, Huahua sleeps on my bed. When she sleeps, she always snores. It is very funny. Huahua is also naughty. Whenever she does something bad and my grandma tries to catch her, she runs away quickly and hides quietly under the bed. Fly and Huahua love to play games with me and I like them very much.

How many grades are there in the school?	As a volunteer teacher, I traveled a long way to a small village school in Longzhou, Guangxi. On my way there, I thought about the village, the school and the childrenn there. However, my heart sank when I arrived there. It wasn't what I expected. It didn't look like a school at all! The school had only three rooms, one for Grades 1, 2 and 3, and the other for Grades 4, 5 and 6. There was a third one for me. The children welcomed me warmly on my first day. They asked me a lot of questions, and I told them stories about myself and my life in Shanghai. The next day, I gave them a test to find out their level . To my surprise, though the test was very easy, over half of the students failed it, yet they all wanted to learn new things. I knew they needed me. I was busy preparing lessons and reading test papers every night. I enjoyed teaching these lovely and hard-working children, and I could see that they were making progress with my help. I have also learned a lot from them. I understand their level is becoming higher and higher, and we are good friends now. I worked in Longzhou for a year. I'm very happy, and the experience is very useful to me. I love the small village and the children. In fact, I would like to continue working here.	['6']

The purpose of the question at the beginning of this news report is to _ .	"Question: What is more astonishing than a 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck being driven down the street? Answer: A 60-ton whale on a flatbed truck exploding and raining blubber ( fat of whales) all over the sidewalk. That's what happened in Taiwan recently, when a dead sperm whale being shipped to the Halobios Research Center for an autopsy developed an extremely bad case of gas and blew up before it reached its destination. The whale was found alive on a prefix = st1 /Taiwanbeach last weekend, and died shortly after it was discovered. Since the 56-foot whale was the largest whale ever beached onTaiwan's shores, scientists wanted to study it and perform an autopsy for educational purpose. Obviously, too much time passed between when the animal died and the time it was set to be moved to the autopsy location, because it had already started to go bad. When things rot, they give off gases as a by-product. In the whale's case, the gases were trapped in its belly. The pressure inside the rotting creature grew so much that it popped like an over-filled balloon. Unfortunately, it was on a truck in the middle of the city of Taiwanat the time--- cars and shops lining the street were covered with whale bits and juices, much to their owners' discouragement. According to the news reports, traffic was tied up for hours while officials tried to clean up the streets. Newspaper editors worldwide were probably smiling to themselves, since they had a ready-made headline--- several reports about the incident were titled "" There She Blows!"" after the famous line from the book Moby Dick."

What do we know about Tiffany & Co. according to the passage?	"How important is color in the business world? Google, one of the biggest U.S. companies, is trying to find it out. The company has already found ""a close connection between color and satisfaction with a person's work area"". That's according to its spokeswoman named Meghan Casserly. ""Color is a silent salesperson,"" said Elyria Kemp. She is an assistant professor of marketing at the University of New Orleans. Kemp is following color trends in business. She is studying the connection between feelings and color. According to Kemp, when people make an evaluation of a product, usually they do this within 90 seconds or less. Besides, more than half of their first evaluation is based on (......) color alone. That's why so many companies are researching their color choices. They are spending thousands of dollars on the research, too. Just think of UPS's Pullman brown, Home Depot's orange and Tiffany & Co.'s blue. Joclyn Benedetto is a spokeswoman for Tiffany & Co. She said the success of the company's jewelry was connected to its blue color. It is used to wrap every product. She said the color was chosen by the founder Charles Lewis Tiffany for the cover of Blue Book, Tiffany's annual collection of beautifully hand-made jewels, which first came out in 1845. Coca-Cola's red color also dates back more than 100 years. The soft drink was shipped in barrels painted red. A spokesperson for Home Depot said research showed that the first thing people thought of was orange when they heard the name of the company. Smaller companies are also realizing the importance of color. But picking the right color is important. ""You know when something is right because you get a feeling of safety, and it's not something that you think about. It just will hit you,"" said Emil Hagopian, a distributor for Mar Plast Color Building Accessories in Ann Arbor, Mich. ""And sometimes, if it's done wrong, that also hits you."""

Why did the man have salty coffee all his life?	"He met her at the party. She was so outstanding, with many boys around her, while he was so normal, with nobody paying attention to him. At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffee with him. She was surprised, but due to being polite, she agreed. They sat in a nice coffee shop. He was too nervous to say anything, and she felt uncomfortable, thinking, ""Please let me go home."" Suddenly he asked the waiter, ""Would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee."" Everybody stared at him---so strange! His face turned red, but, still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it. She asked him curiously, ""Why do you have this hobby?"" He replied, ""When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea. I liked playing in the sea, and I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, I always think of my childhood. I miss my hometown so much. I miss my parents who are still living there."" While saying that, tears filled his eyes. She was deeply touched. That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell about his homesickness must be a man who loves home, cares about home, and has a good sense of responsibility. Then she also started to speak, about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story. They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who meets all her demands: he was kind-hearted, warm and careful. He was such a good person but ! Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful love story, the princess married the prince, then they were living a happy life...And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee. After 40 years, he passed away, leaving her a letter which said, ""My dearest, please forgive my whole-life lie. This was the only lie I said to you ---the salty coffee."" ""Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time. Actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It was hard for me to change so I just went ahead."" ""I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything."" ""Now I'm dying, I'm afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the salty coffee. What a strange and bad taste! But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life!"" ""Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for a second time, I still want to know you and have you for my whole life, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again."" Her tears made the letter totally wet.

Why did Dr P say that Mrs West had to be a strong, able woman?	"""Last week,"" Dr. P said ""I was invited to a doctors' meeting at the R. Hospital. In one of the rooms a patient, an old man, got up from his bed and moved slowly towards me. I could see that he hadn't long to live, but he came up to me and placed his right foot close to mine on the floor."" ""Frank!"" I cried with surprise. He couldn't answer as I knew, but he tried to smile, all the time keeping his foot close to mine. My thoughts raced back more than thirty years--to the dark days of 1941, when I was a student in London. The scene was an air-raid shelter , in which I and about a hundred other people slept every night. Among them were Mrs. West and her son Frank, who lived nearby. Sharing wartime problems, we got to know each other very well. Frank interested me because he was not normal . He had never been normal, ever since he was born. His mother told me he was 37 then, but he had less of a mind than a baby has. Mrs. West, then about 75, was a strong, able woman, as she had to be of course, because Frank depended on her completely. He needed all the attention of a baby. One night a policeman came into our shelter and told Mrs. West that her house had been all destroyed. That wasn't quite true, because the West went on living there for quite some time. But they certainly lost nearly everything they owned. When that kind of thing happened, the rest of us helped the unlucky ones. So before we separated that morning, I stood beside Frank and measured my right foot against his. They were about the same size. That night, then, I took a spare pair of shoes to the shelter for Frank. As soon as he saw me, he came running--and placed his right foot against mine. After that, he always greeted me in the same way."	['She had to give care and thought to her son as to a baby.']
What had happened to cougars before Paul began to study them?	"As a young man, Paul Beier hiked in the mountains of California. Since then, he has decided to choose his career as a wildlife protector. He went to school to learn more first of all. After he earned his doctor's degree, he eagerly signed up for a job studying cougars , which once lived throughout the United States, but now live mainly in the Rocky Mountains and westward. They need not only a lot of land to survive but also plenty of food and places to raise their young. But many wild areas have been divided by freeways and taken over by towns. The small wilderness areas of the Santa Ana Mountains in Southern California didn't have much room for them. And yet a few still lived there. How did they do it? Many big animals are disappearing. Those that survive are being trapped in shrinking patches of habitat. A patch may not have enough space or food for a cougar to survive. Scientists wondered if cougars could move from one patch to another. If so, maybe humans could preserve wildlife corridors to connect the patches, providing enough room for the animals. But no one had shown that animals use wildlife corridors in real life. To see if cougars had found corridors through local suburbs and freeways, Paul and his research team studied 32 cougars for five years. They used a drug to make each cat sleep, buckled a radio collar around its neck, and let it go. Every day, Paul used an electrical device that sends and receives radio signals to find cougars, listening for radio beeps from their collars. Once or twice a week, he trailed one of the cougars all night. He traced their travels on a map. Sure enough, some of them had discovered paths from one small park land to the next. One cougar became famous for his travels. He was named M6:""M""for Male, and""6""because he was the sixth one collared in the study. M6's corner of the Santa Ana Mountains wasn't large enough for him. Chino Hills State Park was not far away, but the trip was not safe. After dark, M6 used a paved vehicle underground passage to cross undera busy eight-lane freeway. He slipped by a riding stable, and then picked his way through a golf course and across two sets of busy railroad tracks. Finally, he arrived in the sheltered canyons of 12,000-acre Chino Hills State Park. There, the cougar found deer to hunt. During a year and a half, the scientists recorded M6 making this journey 22 times! Then Paul learned of plans to build houses, gas stations, and a mall that would block M6's path. Paul once said,""The loss of this corridor would guarantee the extinction of the cougar from the Chino Hills and endanger the entire population of lions in the Santa Ana Mountains.""A local citizens' group called Hills for Everyone raised money to buy the land and add it to the state park. When the group visited the state capital and showed the map that Paul had made of M6's journeys, the lawmakers saw how important the corridor was. The lawmakers had the passage preserved, with the pavement removed and with native bushes near the openings. While traffic roared above, M6 and other cougars could move safely between the state park and the mountains. Other animals such as deer, foxes, and bobcats could also use the corridor. Paul's research showed that wildlife corridors can save animals. Since his study in the Santa Ana Mountains, scientists around the world have begun restoring and protecting wildlife corridors."

"The best title of the passage may be "" _ ""."	"Many homes have cameras to protect them from danger. The cameras can tell the owners if someone has entered. But the cameras do not know whether the person is a family member, a friend, a postman or a criminal . But a new camera made by a French company can recognize faces. It can tell parents at work that their children have returned from school, or that the mail has been sent to their home. It can also tell them if a stranger has entered their home. When family members enter a home, the smart camera ""recognizes"" them and sends information to the owner's phone. The owner can choose to see the video then or later. But if an unknown person enters a home, the camera will send a warning sound on the owner's phone. This is what happened recently to a smart home camera owner named Damien. He lives in Paris. ""On a Friday I was at work, having a big monthly meeting when my phone moved. At first I told myself 'Oh, it must be a wrong warn,' but my phone was telling me there was a face that the camera did not recognize. Something was happening in my house!"" ""I saw a person I did not know with his shoes on, which is not allowed in my apartment . I watched it on the video. I felt quite surprised.

What is the focus of the last-5 -day campaigns for both presidential candidates?	Washington, November 1, 2012 (CNN) -- After years of planning and months of campaigning , the most expensive presidential race in history comes down to a final five-day whirlwind of speeches and television ads in the eight states still up for grabs. President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney plan to hold virtually nonstop events between now and the Tuesday election considered too close to call. The focus is on battleground states worth 95 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Both sides are trying to close the deal with a decreasing number of uncommitted voters, while making sure supporters actually cast ballots. That means a game of campaign chess that started Thursday, with appearances by the candidates and their assistants as well as advertising dollars allocated to the places considered most vital to success. Concluding a race expected to cost more than $6 billion overall, Obama and Romney and their running mates will hit all the battleground states -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Virginia and Wisconsin. The campaigns also are unloading a blast of television ads and mailings that threaten to overwhelm voters already saturated with politicking. Perhaps no one said it better than 4-year-old Abigael Evans of Fort Collins, Colorado, who -- according to NPR -- cried after listening to more election coverage on the radio and told her mother, 'I'm tired of Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.'

Which of the following statements is not true?	As far back as 700 B. C, man has talked about children being cared for by wolves. Romulus and Remus, the legendary twin founders of Rome, were said to have been cared for by wolves. It is believed that when a she-wolf loses her litter, she tries to get human child to take its place. This seemingly foolish and unreasonable idea did not become believable until the late nineteenth century when a French doctor actually found a ten-year-old boy having nothing on wandering in the woods. He didn't walk upright, could not speak understandably, nor could he relate to people. He only growled and stared at them. Finally the doctor won the boy's confidence and began to work with him. After many long years of devoted and patient teaching, the doctor was able to get the boy to clothe and feed himself, recognize and say a number of words, as well as write letters and form words.

The best title for this passage is _ .	"On February 3rd, 1949, New York Harbor was an exciting place. Many people were there to greet a ship from France. On the ship were 49 French railroad boxcars filled with gifts from the people of France to the people of America. These boxcars were from the famous Merci Train(Merci:a French word meaning ""thank you""). After World War II, a lot of factories, roads and farms in France had been destroyed. Many French people had no jobs or money and had little to wear and little to eat. In the winter of 1947, a train was sent across the United States, stopping in cities and towns along the way. At every stop, people gave whatever they could. Factories gave clothing and medicine. Farmers gave food. Families gave money. Even school children gave away their pocket money. All the things were then taken to France by ship. By 1949,the French had begun to recover from the war. The Merci Train was their way of saying ""thank you"" to America. French people had filled the boxcars with gifts. Most of _ were personal, like hand-made toys, children's drawings, or postcards. But the boxcars themselves were perhaps the most meaningful of the gifts. On each car, the French people had painted the pictures of all their 40 provinces. with an American eagle on the front. The boxcars were taken to each state of America, where they were warmly greeted. Now many of the states still keep their boxcars. Gifts sent by the French people can still be seen in some museums. The Merci Train came out of the war, but it now reminds the world that countries can also work together in peace."	['The Story Of The Merci Train']
How do dolphins exchange information with each other?	"Dolphins are our friends. They can use tools to solve problems although they don't have hands. For example, scientists have ever found that a dolphin can make a shy eel come out of its hole with a dead fish. Dolphins use different sounds to exchange information with each other. Scientists in Hawaii have developed a sign language to give instructions to dolphins, and the results are amazing. They find that dolphins not only understand the meaning of individual words, but also understand the importance of word order in a sentence. Most animals enjoy playing -- but dolphins seem to like making their games as challenging as possible. On a beautiful day in 1997, scientists at a beach watched a little dog going into the sea and swimming towards the dolphins. To their surprise, the dolphins came up to the dog and then started throwing it into the air. The dog seemed to enjoy the ""game"" and continued playing with the dolphins for more than an hour. Dolphins live in a very different world from ours, but they are very good at our ""IQ tests"" . For example, they will jump out of the water when they hear a whistle noise. They do this because they will get a fish as a prize. There is still much to learn about these cute problem-solvers, but it is certain that watching a dolphin show is fun. ,.

Americans hurry at meals because _	Americans eat breakfast and lunch quickly unless it is a social business or family occasion. The evening meal is usually longer and a time for families to gather together. Rushing through daytime meals is part of the fast pace in America. Another reason for rushing through daytime meals is that many people eat in restaurant that are usually crowded with people waiting for a place so that they can be served and return to work at the proper time. So each one hurried to make room for the next person. As there are busy people everywhere, there is a real difference with meals that are eaten in a hurry and those that can be enjoyed slowly with friends.	['they are very busy.']

Reading might be better than many activities if you want to educate yourself and improve your chances of succeeding in your work. If you're serious about creating the habit of reading,what's important is finding a time you can read every day--often that's early morning or late at night,or both. For others, it might be during their lunch break. You only need to read for 10 to 20 minutes a day to form the habit. Then, you need to find a place that's comfortable. Make sure it has good lighting, the temperature is nice and you're in a good chair. Or you can find some place that you can relax in without falling asleep, although there's nothing wrong with sleep. Next,be sure to shut off the TV,Internet,cell phone,radio, or other music. Let reading be a quiet time. Mark an ""x"" on your calendar every day you read, and try to keep your unbroken ""x""es going as long as possible. A habit is much easier to form if it's something you enjoy, not something you are made to do. So make the time, you spend reading a joy.

On Pluto's surface, liquid methane boils to form an atmospheric haze, which would be most similar to _ .	"(This selection was originally published in 1992. Pluto is no longer classified as a planet.) Pluto is in many ways the strangest of the planets. It is small and has a large moon(called Charon). Its orbit is unusual, which may cause it to have seasons in the sense that when it is close to the sun, the liquid methane on its surface boils to form a kind of atmospheric haze . When the planet moves farther away from the sun, it starts to snow solid methane. Pluto is not dark. Despite its great distance from the sun, the surface of Pluto is probably as bright as a moonlit night on Earth. The reason is all that methane, which is as white as newly fallen snow. The discovery of Pluto was more accident than design. The American astronomer Percival Lowell had predicted the existence of a ninth planet(he called it Planet X)based on what he took to be irregularities in the orbit of Neptune. Today astronomers argue that these ""irregularities"" weren't real, but the result of instrumental error. Nevertheless, Lowell produced predictions about where Planet X ought to be(although, to be honest, the predictions changed occasionally when he redid the calculations).In any case, in 1930 Clyde Tombaugh, doing a systemic sky survey that would have found the planet no matter where it was, discovered the planet we now call Pluto. By coincidence, its position was pretty close to where Lowell's last prediction said it should be. Was it just luck? We'll never know."	['steam']

""Added by condos and apartment houses currently opening for daily rent, the number of lodgings for tourists throughout the country has increased over the years, but not the qualities. Many of today's tourists are so _ and selective that they'd prefer quality places where personnel should be very responsible and experienced in taking care of them while security should be constantly and effectually maintained,"" she said. Employees and staff in charge of providing accommodations to tourists should be expert in communicating with the foreigners, service-minded and speak fluent English, according to the council leader. Thailand is seen to receive up to 23.1 million tourists from other countries around the world next year, compared to about 21.7 million, who have reportedly visited the country throughout this year, about 2.6 million of whom from China, while as much as two trillion baht (US$66.6 billion) is expected to be earned from tourist industry by 2015, compared to about one trillion baht (US$33.3 billion) this year. Thailand's most favorite destinations for tourists include the world-famous beach resorts of Pattaya and Phuket, the Andaman Sea archipelagos of Krabi and Surat Thani and the capital city of Bangkok. The council leader made her comments in response to news reports that the government might deregulate businesses of running condominiums and apartment houses to the extent that they might not only serve as a place which collects monthly rent from the tenants but as a hotel where guests pay the room rates on a daily basis. No parking lots or hotel-operating licenses might be legally required at such places nationwide only if they were practically turned into daily hotels or guesthouses."

From the reading we can infer that a die-hard fan _ .	San Russell is not your average baseball fan. He is a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan. He has a season ticket and he arranges his work schedule so he does not miss a game. San also attends game dressed in their uniform, and his car is red. He has even lost some friends by choosing to watch the Red Sox instead of going to their weddings. Is this healthy behavior? Although Russell's case is extreme, being a sports fan can be healthy for you. According to a study at the University of Kansan in the USA, sports fans suffer from depression less than people who are not interested in sports, fans also experience other effects from watching their team play. When their team wins a game, their own confidence and happiness increase, just like the athletes. Losing, on the other hand, always leads to some sense of disappointment. What about die-hard fans whose team always loses? The team spirit keeps those fans from losing hope. Knowing that other fans are probably feeling the same way also helps them. In addition, there is always the hope that their team will win the next game. Russell has lost some friends because of his love for baseball and although you may think that would make him unhappy, he has made many more new friends because of his team spirit. For Sam Russell, supporting the Red Sox is not just a hobby; it is a way of life and the secret of his happiness.	"[""prefers going to a game to a friend's wedding""]"

During their journey in Africa, the two travelers _ .	"For six hours we shot through the landscape of the Karoo desert in South Africa. Just rocks and sand and baking sun. Knowing our journey was ending, Daniel and I just wanted to remember all we had seen and done. He used a camera. I used words. I had already finished three notebooks and was into the fourth, a beautiful leather notebook I'd bought in a market in Mozambique. Southern Africa was full of stories. And visions. We were almost drunk on sensations. The roaring of the water at Victoria Falls, the impossible silence of the Okavango Delta in Botswana . And then the other things: dogs in the streets, whole families in Soweto living in one room, a kilometre from clean water. As we drove towards the setting sun, a quietness fell over us. The road was empty -- we hadn't seen another car for hours. And as I drove, something caught my eye, something moving next to me. I glanced in the mirror of the car; I glanced sideways to the right, and that was when I saw them. Next to us, by the side of the road, thirty, forty wild horses were racing the car, a cloud of dust rising behind them -- brown, muscular horses almost close enough to touch them, to smell their hot breath. I didn't know how long they had been there next to us. I shouted to Dan: ""Look!"", but he was in a deep sleep, his camera lying useless by his feet. They raced the car for a few seconds, then disappeared far behind us, a memory of heroic forms in the red landscape. When Daniel woke up an hour later I told him what had happened. ""Wild horses?"" he said. ""Why didn't you wake me up?"" ""I tried. But they were gone after a few seconds."" ""Are you sure you didn't dream it?"" ""You were the one who was sleeping!"" Typical, he said. ""The best photos are the ones we never take."" We checked into a dusty hotel and slept the sleep of the dead."	['recorded their experiences in different ways']
What do the scientists find in their research?	Most people regard zoos as safe places for animals, where struggles such as difficulty finding food and avoiding predators don't exist. Without such problems, animals in zoos should live to a ripe old age. But that may not be true for the largest land animals on Earth. Scientists have known that elephants in zoos often develop diseases, joint problems and behavior changes. Sometimes, they even become unable to have babies. To learn more about how captivity affects elephants, a team of international scientists led by Mason, a biologist, compared the life spans of female elephants born in zoos with female elephants living outdoors in the wild. Zoos keep detailed records of all the animals in their care, documenting factors such as birth dates, illnesses, weight and death. These records made it possible for the researchers to analyze 40 years of data on 800 elephants in zoos. The team found that female elephants born in zoos lived an average of 16.9 years. Their wild counterparts who died of natural causes lived an average of 56 years----more than three times as long. Scientists don't yet know for sure why wild elephants seem to live so much better than their zoo-raised counterparts. Mason thinks stress and obesity may be to blame. Zoo elephants don't get the same kind of exercise as they do in the wild, and most are very fat. Elephant social lives are also much different in zoos than in the wild, where they live in large groups. Another finding from the study showed that elephants born in zoos were more likely to die earlier than elephants captured in the wild and brought to zoos. Mason suggests stress in the mothers in zoos might cause them to have babies that are less likely to survive. The study raises some questions about acquiring more elephants to keep in zoos. While some threatened and endangered species living in zoos reproduce successfully and keep healthy populations, that doesn't appear to be the case with elephants.

How many people are very careful not to let their partner know their income?	"Do you usually go Dutch(AA) when you take someone out to dinner? Do you expect your date to pay for the whole meal? Many people say that as long as there's love, money doesn't matter much. But this might change when the relationship gets serious and it is related to the money borrowed from the bank, the family present accounts and debt. A survey among 8 million couples in the UK suggested that 44% of married couples don't know exactly what their partner earns. An astonishing 23% actively try to keep their finances secret from their partners. About 38% of them are open to each other. Another 12% refuses to tell the truth. British relationship expert Russell says: ""It's very difficult to talk about money. Often there's guilt, there's shame. To start those conversations is difficult. Money can be about how we value ourselves, how we feel valued. It's not just a simple case of talking about hard cash."" So if you are in a couple, it might be a good idea to check if you both are on the same page about money before bills pile up on the kitchen table and love flies out of the window. When moving in together, couples should not only talk about their personal habits but also about their financial ones. Russell has a word of advice: ""Accept the fact that in your relationship you might do money differently - there might be a spender or a saver. It's very attractive if your partner does things differently to say they're wrong. Do it differently but plan it well."" And now, back to that date. Would you be bored with someone who was attractive but expected you to pay the bill by yourself? There's food for thought."	['About 1.9 million.']
What did they do after they opened the food?	"A little old man and his wife walked slowly into McDonald's on a cold winter evening. They took a table near the back wall, and then the little old man walked to the cash register to order. After a while he got the food back and they began to open it.

Then he neatly put the half of the food in front of his wife. He took a sip of the drink and his wife _ . ""how poor the old people are!"" the people around them thought. As the man began to eat his hamburger and his French fries, his wife sat there watching him and took turns to drink. A young man came over and offered to buy another meal for them. But they refused politely and said that they got used to sharing everything. Then a young lady asked a question of the little old lady. "" Madam, why aren't you eating?

All the following factors are a must for making big trees EXCEPT _ .	"Big trees are incredibly important ecologically. For a start, they provide food for countless other species and shelter for many animals. With their tall branches in the sun, they capture vast amounts of energy. This allows them to produce massive crops of fruit and flowers that sustain much of the animal life in the forest. Only a small number of tree species have the genetic ability to grow really big. The biggest are native to North America, but big trees grow all over the globe, from the tropics to the forests of the high latitudes . To achieve giant size, a tree needs three things: the right place to establish its seedling, good growing conditions and lots of time with low adult death rate. Lose any of these, and you will lose your biggest trees. In some parts of the world, populations of big trees are dwindling because their seedlings cannot survive. In southern India, for instance, an aggressive non-native bush, Lantana camara, is invading the floor of many forests. Lantana grows so thickly that young trees often fail to take root. With no young trees to replace them, it is only a matter of time before most of the big trees disappear. Without the right growing conditions, trees cannot get really big and there is some evidence to suggest tree growth could slow in a warmer world, particularly in environments that are already warm. Having worked for decades at La Selva Biological Station in Puerto Viejo de Sarapiqui, Costa Rica, David and Deborah Clark and colleagues have shown that tree growth there declines markedly in warmer years. ""During the day, their growth shuts down when it gets too warm, and at night they consume more energy because their metabolic rate increases,"" explains David Clark. With less energy produced in warmer years and more being consumed just to survive, there is even less energy available for growth. The darks' theory, if correct, means tropical forests would shrink over time. The largest, oldest trees would progressively die off and tend not to be replaced. According to the Clarks, this might cause a destabilization of the climate; as older trees die, forests would release some of their stored carbon into the atmosphere, causing a cycle of further warming, forest shrinkage and carbon emissions. Besides, big trees face threats from elsewhere."	['high-latitude location']
Which of the following statements is true?	In life, people come across many experiences, which they remember throughout their lives. I had a similar experience, too. I was very excited. It was the day of my last paper of the final examination. My mind was full of thoughts of how I would spend my vacation. I was especially excited of the invitation that my uncle had given me to stay with him for a few days in Cambridge. I was prepared for the subject, physics. My friends and I were on the ground doing the last minute revisions and also discussing the questions that were supposed to come in the paper. Suddenly the bell rang and we got into our classrooms. The teacher came and quickly handed out the answer paper and the question paper. The paper was of two hours and some of the expected questions came. I finished it almost forty-five minutes earlier. But since it was a rule not to collect the answer paper before the allotted time. the teacher was not collecting and I had to sit till the time was over. I checked my paper twice and corrected some of the mistakes in it. I started thinking about the place my friends and I had planned to go after the paper. Though I was thinking for a long time, the time seemed to be endless. So I thought of drawing something on the question paper and turned it overleaf. I was shocked to see that the page which I had supposed to be blank had four more questions on it which carried 20 marks and would take at least half an hour to complete. I had a quick glance at my watch. There were only 10 minutes left. I was so nervous that I was hardly in a state to write anything. They were the sub-questions of the last question. Suddenly our physics teacher came in and told all of us that in the last question, out of 6 sub-questions only 2 had to be solved. I felt very much _ . Thereafter I never made such mistakes again. But I realized that my anxiousness and excitement could have cost me to lose 20 marks and decided never to make such a mistake again.	['The writer made some mistakes during the exam.']

It can be inferred from the passage that a major interest of the officials of GlacierNational Parkis to _ .	Glacier National Park in Montana shares boundaries with prefix = st1 /Canada, an American Indian reservation, and a national forest. Along the North Fork of the Flathead River, the park also borders about 17,000 acres of private lands that are currently used for ranching, timber, and agriculture. This land is an important part of the habitat and migratory routes for several endangered species that frequent the park. These private lands are essentially the only ones available for development in the region. With encouragement from the park, local landowners initiated a landaus planning effort to guide the future of the North Fork. The park is a partner in an interlocal agreement that calls for resource managing agencies to work together and with the more than 400 private owners in the area. A draft plan has been prepared, with objective of maintaining traditional economic uses but limiting new development that would damage park resources. Voluntary action by landowners, in cooperation with the park and the county, is helping to restrict small lot subdivisions, maintain wildlife corridors, and minimize any harmful impact on the environment. The willingness of local landowners to participate in this protection effort may have been stimulated by concerns that congress would impose a legislative solution. Nevertheless, many local residents want to retain the existing character of the area. Meetings between park officials and landowners have led to a dramatically improved understanding of all concerns.

According to the passage, the ancestors of the Potter family most probably _ .	"As is often the case, when your teacher asks a question, there is only one correct answer. But there is one question that has millions of current answers. That question is ""What's your name?"" Everyone gives a different answer, but everyone is correct. Have you ever thought about people's names? Where do they come from? What do they mean? People's first names, or given names, are chosen by their parents. Sometimes the name of a grandparent or other member of the family is used. Some parents choose the name of a well-known person. A boy could be named George Washington Smith; a girl could be named Helen Keller Jones. Some people give their children names that mean good things. Clara means ""bright""; Beatrice means ""one who gives happiness""; Donald means ""world ruler""; Leonard means ""as brave as a lion"". The earliest last names, or surnames, were taken from place names. A family with the name Brook or Brooks probably lived near brook ; someone who was called Longstreet probably lived on a long, paved road. The Greenwood family lived in or near a leafy forest. Other early surnames came from people's occupations. The most common occupational name is Smith, which means a person who makes things with iron or other metals. In the past, smiths were very important workers in every town and village. Some other occupational names are: Carter -- a person who owned or drove a cart; Potter -- a person who made pots and pans. The ancestors of the Baker family probably baked bread for their neighbors in their native village. The Carpenter's great-great-great-grandfather probably built houses and furniture. Sometimes people were known for the color of their hair or skin, or their size, or their special abilities. When there were two men who were named John in the same village, the John with the gray hair probably became John Gray. Or the John was very tall could call himself John Tallman. John Fish was probably an excellent swimmer and John Lightfoot was probably a fast runner or a good dancer. Some family names were made by adding something to the father's name. English-speaking people added -s or -son. The Johnsons are descendants of John; the Roberts family's ancestor was Robert. Irish and Scottish people added Mac or Mc or O. Perhaps all of the MacDonnell's and the McDonnell's and the O'Donnell's are _ of the same Donnell."	['made kitchen tools or contains']

Why do students from Peking University, Tshinghua University and Nankai University take part in the World Championship of Mahjong?	"Mahjong, that favorite pastime of ""old folks"" in Shanghai, is finding a new audience among younger players, and many university students are becoming mad about this traditional Chinese game. Students at Fudan University have even formed a Mahjong club. This resurgence of the game, however, is not without its critics. Some people still associate the game with gambling and for many years Mahjong was banned in China. One critic, surnamed Meng, was quoted as saying, ""Mahjong is a bad custom that will distract students from studies."" But Yu Guangyuan, former vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , says Mahjong is a ""healthy, scientific, friendly mind game."" Mr. Yu's opinion seems to be shared by the majority of Chinese. They see the game as an activity that requires great concentration and intellectual skill. They also see the game as an important part of Chinese culture and a pastime that brings family and friends closer together. This Spring Festival many families will no doubt spend hours around the Mahjong table getting reacquainted with each other. For them, playing Mahjong is a way of spending quality family time. No one knows who invented Mahjong. Some say it was Confucius, others say the current form of the game was developed right here in Shanghai in the late19th century. It is certainly because of Shanghai that the game enjoys its worldwide popularity. It was brought to America in the 1920s and has since spread throughout Europe and other parts of Asia. There is now a World Championship of Mahjong which is held every year. This year's championship was held in Chongqing and attracted players from America, Europe and Russia, as well as students from Peking University, Tshinghua University and Nankai University. There was no prize money, but the players delighted in using their wits and their understanding of statistics and probability theory to defeat their clever opponents. Of course, Mahjong doesn't have to always be that intense. For young people it can be a way to relax and to socialize, a chance to get away from their computers and talk to other people face to face. So, this Spring Festival, why not get out the ""old folks"" tiles: it's good to be mad about Mahjong!"	['Because they can happily use their wisdom and what they have learned to defeat their clever opponents.']
What would be be the best title for the passage?	"A new University of Graz study concludes that vegetarians are more often ill and have a lower quality of living than meat-eaters. According to the German press release, vegetarians ""have cancer and heart attacks more often"". The release also says that they show more psychological disorders than meat eaters. Consequently, the report writes, they are a greater burden on the health care system. According to the press release the scientists evaluated data from the Austrian Health Interview Survey (AT-HIS), which is also part of an important and valuable EU survey (European Health Interview Survey). The scientists examined a total of 1320 persons who were divided up into 4 groups . All groups were comparable with respect to gender, age, and socio-economic status. The study also accounted for smoking and physical activity. Also the BMI was within the normal range for all four groups. The only thing that really was different among the four groups was the diet. The four groups were: vegetarians, meat-eaters with lots of fruit and veggies, little meat-eaters and big meat-eaters. The press release states that the results contradict _ that meat-free diets are healthier. Vegetarians have twice as many allergies as big meat-eaters, and they showed 166% higher cancer rates . Moreover, the scientists found that vegans had a 150% higher rate of heart attacks. In total the scientists looked at 18 different chronic illnesses. Compared to the big meat-eaters, vegetarians were hit harder in 14 of the 18 illnesses. In the analysis, the University of Graz found that vegetarians were also twice as likely to suffer for anxiety or depressions than big meat-eaters. That result was confirmed by the University of Hildesheim, which found that vegetarians suffered significantly more from depressions, anxiety, psychosomatic complaints and eating disorders. The University of Graz scientists also found that vegetarians are impacted more by ilnessses and visit the doctor more frequently. Big meat-eaters were also found to have a ""significantly better quality of life in all categories"", the study found. The four categories examined were: physical and psychological health, social relationships and environment-related life quality."	['Are Vegetarians Healthier']
What made Mr. and Mrs. Harris hold a party at their house?	"Mr. Harris used to work in Dover, but then he changed his work, and he and his wife moved to another town. They did not have many friends there, but they soon met a lot of interesting people, and after a few weeks, they often went to dinner or to parties at other people's houses. Then Mrs. Harris said to her husband, ""We've been to a lot of other people's houses, and now we must invite them to our house, mustn't we?"" ""Yes, certainly,"" answered her husband, ""A big party will be the easiest thing, won't it? Then we can start to invite people to dinner in small numbers next month."" So Mrs. Harris said, ""Yes, I'll invite all our friends here to a big party on 5th December."" ""How many will that be?"" Mr. Harris asked. ""Don't invite too many."" Mrs. Harris was beginning to write the invitations when her husband saw that she was writing, ""Party. 6.30 to 8.30 p.m."" ""That isn't very nice, is it?"" he said. ""You're telling our guests that they must go at 8.30."" So Mrs. Harris just wrote ""Party. 6.30 p.m."" A lot of guests came, and they all had a good time, so they did not go home at 8.30. In fact they were still there at mid-night when the door bell rang and a policeman arrived. He said, ""You must stop making a noise, because someone has complained."" Mr. Harris said he did not want to quarrel with the policeman, so everyone went home. They were sorry to have to go. When Mr. and Mrs. Harris were alone again, she said to him. ""That was a surprise, wasn't it? Who complained about the noise?"" ""I did,"" Mr Harris answered in a tired voice."	"[""They had gone to other people's parties many times.""]"
From the passage, we can guess the gangsters were those _ .	"There was a time when the owners of shops and businesses in Chicago had to pay large sums of money to gangsters in return for ""protection"". If the money was not paid immediately, the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop. Getting ""protection money"" is not a modern means. As long ago as the fourteenth century, an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters. Then Sir John Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a group of soldiers and settled near Florence. He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto. Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other, Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to those who were willing to pay the high price he demanded. In times of peace, when business was bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them. Hawkwood made large sums of money with this method. In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero .When he died at eighty, the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had his picture painted, which was in memory of ""this bravest man""."

Greece has been a seafaring nation for centuries, and Greece is very well known for its shipping industry. More than three thousand years ago, the Greek people developed a very sophisticated society. They have a great civilization, one of the greatest that the Western would have ever seen. Greek architecture, thinking and art influenced other languages, including English. For example, the English words alphabet, democracy, and arithmetic come from Greek. Today Greece is one of the most popular nations with the tourists who visit Europe. Thousands of people are attracted to the country because of its beautiful scenery, magnificent ancient buildings, and its excellent summer weather.	['both A and B']

What would be the best title for this passage ?	"Five years ago, Wang Baoqiang was a nobody to most Chinese people. However, he is now a household film star in China. Wang is the youngest child of a poor family in Hebei province . Dreaming of becoming an actor, he left home at the age of 8 to study kung fu at Shaolin Temple, since kung-fu actors seemed to appear most often on the big screen. At 14, he moved to Beijing for his acting career for the first time, with little money in his pocket. He worked at a construction site for 20 to 25 yuan per day, and spent his free time standing in front of the Beijing Film Studio, eager to be chosen as temporary actors. This was the most difficult time for the boy. His opportunity finally came one day after he went for a role in the movie ""Blind Shaft"". He was chosen to play a young coal miner. The movie won him three prizes in Thailand, France and Taiwan. But his success didn't make any difference to his life. That year, he went home for the Spring Festival. He gave his family his earnings from the movie, around US$250 and then returned to Beijing with 500 yuan, the same amount he had when he first set foot in the city. His life was as simple as before. Thanks to his natural performance in ""Blind Shaft,"" he was invited by the famous director Feng Xiaogang to act in the film ""A World Without Thieves"" in 2004, which made him famous immediately. People called him ""Shagen,"" the name of his character in the movie. Wang's latest work, ""Soldiers' Sortie"" has made him the most popular actor on the Chinese mainland . For the actor, it's a dream coming true. ""Dreams come true. I think my life is exactly a course of pursuing dreams. No matter how tough one thing is, I can make it as long as I put great effort into it,"" he said."	['Pursuing Dreams']
What does the author probably think of Susan's life stories?	Susan Boyle was born as the ninth child in a Catholic family. She suffered from learning disabilities ever since her birth because of her mother's poor health. School was difficult for Susan and she was bulled because of her different behaviour. _ , who were much older, had life experiences that were unknown to their little sister. From the time of her birth, Susan was a screamer. The only really safe place that she would use as a repeat was her bedroom. There she would hang posters of her musical heroes on the walls and sing popular music into a hairbrush that she pretended was a microphone. One by one her brothers and sisters moved away from home and then Susan's father died. This left her alone with an old mother and a cat. She tried volunteer work. Her best state of mind, however, was found when she was singing and so she would regularly join others in karaoke or pubs where she could show her skills and receive appreciation from the crowd. When Susan announced at Christmas that she was planning to take part in the Britain's Got Talent competition, her brothers and sisters tried to discourage her. It was a wonder that she was even able to do the audition considering the troubles she faced just physically getting to the right place. The Woman I Was Born to Be is a beautiful story written in the simple but humorous voice of the author, Susan Boyle. She tells her story from birth to the present in an interesting and educational manner. I love this book ! In fact, I read the whole thing in one day! There is something in the stories that not only teaches the reader but also encourage us to reach for our dreams--no matter how impossible they may seem to be!	['Encouraging']
The bus starts. The old man _ .	"It's Sunday. There are many people in the bus. And an old man is looking here and there. He wants to find an empty seat . Then he finds one. He goes to it. A small bag is on the seat. And a young man is sitting beside it. ""Is this seat empty?"" asks the old man. ""No, it's for a woman. She goes to buy some bananas."" Says the young man.

Then the old man throws the bag out of the bus window. The young man jumps up and shouts, ""Don't throw! It's my bag!"""	['throws the bag out of the window']
Why does Loe suggest starting with herbs?	"What Theresa Loe is doing proves that a large farm isn't _ for a modern grow-your-own lifestyle. On a mere 1/10 of an acre in Los Angeles, Loe and her family grow, can and preserve much of the food they consume. Loe is a master food preserver, gardener and canning expert. She also operates a website, where she shares her tips and recipes, with the goal of demonstrating that every has the ability to control what's on their plate. Loe initially went to school to become an engineer, but she quickly learned that her enthusiasm was mainly about growing and preparing her own food. ""I got into cooking my own food and started growing my own herbs and foods for that fresh flavor,""she said. Engineer by day, Loe learned cooking at night school. She ultimately purchased a small piece of land with her husband and began growing their own foods. ""I teach people how to live farm-fresh without a farm,"" Loe said. Through her website Loe emphasizes that ""anybody can do this anywhere."" Got an apartment with a balcony ? Plant some herbs. A window? Perfect spot for growing. Start with herbs, she recommends, because ""they're very forgiving."" Just a little of the herbs ""can take your regular cooking to a whole new level,"" she added. ""I think it's a great place to start."" ""Then? Try growing something from a seed, she said, like a tomato or some tea."" Canning is a natural extension of the planting she does. With every planted food. Loe noted, there's a moment when it's bursting with its absolute peak flavor. ""I try and keep it in a time capsule in a canning jar,"" Loe said. ""Canning for me is about knowing what's in your food, knowing where it comes from."" In addition to being more in touch with the food she's eating, another joy comes from passing this knowledge and this desire for good food to her children: ""Influencing them and telling them your opinion on not only being careful what we eat but understanding _ ,"" she said, ""that if we don't take care of the earth, no will."""

Which can be the best title for the passage?	"Many grown-ups worry that spending too much time playing video games isn't good for a kid's health. But some doctors have noticed that kids who bring their game players to the hospital seem less worried about being there. They also seem to feel less pain when they are giving all their attention on a car race or other games. At a children's center in Baltimore, Maryland, young kids are finding hospital visits easier to deal with, thanks to a test program called HOPE. Patients in HOPE have a life-threatening condition where their kidneys no longer get rid of wastes from their blood. To get their blood cleaned, these kids must use the dialysis machines at the hospital three times a week, for at least three hours each time. HOPE allows kids to play Internet sports, racing, and other games with each other. They will be able to connect with kids in other hospitals who have the same problem. ""We want to use the Internet to bring together kids who are ill, and let them know they are not alone,"" said Arun Mathews, the doctor of the program. He loved video games himself and got the idea to connect kids all over the country. Many researchers elsewhere are testing video programs that might help young patients. For example, nine-year-old Ben Duskin of San Francisco, California, who was struggling with cancer helped to design a video game where players got rid of cancer cells. That's all great news, because doctors already know that reducing pain and worry helps patients heal faster."	['Video Games May Help Reduce Pain']
Jack came to sit in front of the visitor in order to _ .	"Most dog owners feel that their dogs are their best friends. Almost everyone likes dogs because they try hard to please their owners. One of my favorite stories is about a dog who wanted his owner to please him. One of my friends has a large German shepherd ( ) named Jack. Every Sunday afternoon, my friend takes Jack for a walk in the park. Jack likes these long walks very much. One Sunday afternoon, a young man came to visit my friend. He stayed a long time, and he talked and talked. Soon it was time for my friend to take Jack for his walk, but the visitor didn't leave. Jack became very worried about his walk in the park. He walked around the room several times and then sat down directly in front of the visitor and looked at him. But the visitor paid no attention. He continued talking. Finally, Jack couldn't stand it any longer. He went out of the room and came back a few minutes later. He sat down again in front of the visitor, but this time he held the man's hat in his mouth. German shepherds aren't the only intelligent dogs. Another intelligent dog is a Seeing Eye dog. This is a special dog which helps blind people walk along the streets and do many other things. We call these dogs Seeing Eye dogs because they are the ""eye"" of the blind people and they help them to ""see"". Seeing Eye dogs generally go to special schools for several years to learn to help blind people."	['ask him to leave immediately']
How many people did the writer mention in this passage?	Do you know Fei Junlong and Nie Haisheng? Fei Junlong was born in 1965. He is a Chinese astronaut selected as a member of the Shenzhou program. He was born in Jiangsu and joined the People's Liberation Army Air Force in 1982 at the age of 17. And since then he has only returned home six times. As a fighter pilot , he was selected to an astronaut in 1998. He married Wang Jie in 1991 and has one son. Nie Haisheng was born in September 1964. He is also a Chinese astronaut selected for the Shenzhou program. He is from Hubei. After graduating from high school he joined the People's Liberation Army Air Force, and became a fighter pilot. In 1998 he was selected for the astronaut program. He was one of the three astronauts who were in the final group to train for the Shenzhou 5 fight. Yang Liwei was also picked out for the flight, with Zhai Ahigang. On September 23,2005 it was reported that Zhai and Nie would be one of the three pairs of astronauts who would be in the final training for Shenzhou 6. But in the end, Fei and Nie were chosen, and Zhai missed his chance to space again. Nie Haisheng got married to Nie Jielin and has an 11-year-old daughter.	['8.']
What conclusion can we draw from the passage?	"Lucy, whose skeleton was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974, died shortly after she fell out of a tree, according to a new study published Monday in the British journalNature. For their research, Kappelman and Dr. Richard Ketcham used a CT scanner to create more than 35,000 ""slices"" of Lucy's skeleton. Scientists named her Lucy from the Beatles song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"", which was played at the camp the night of her discovery. The following analysis of the slices showed sharp, clean breaks seen at the end of Lucy's right humerus are similar to bone breaks seen in victims of falls. The researchers concluded that these and other breaks in her skeleton show that Lucy, who is believed to have stood about 3 feet 6 inches and weighed about 60 pounds, fell feet first and used her arms to support herself -- but that the injury was too severe to have been survivable. The researchers estimate that Lucy was going about 35 miles an hour when she hit the ground after falling from a height of roughly 40 feet, according to the statement. That sounds _ . But other scientists are doubtful. ""There are countless explanations for bone breaks,"" Dr, Donald C, Johanson, director of the Institute of Human Origins and one of the scientists who discovered Lucy, said, ""The suggestion that she fell out of a tree is largely a just-so story and therefore unprovable."" Johanson said it was more likely that Lucy's breaks occurred long after she died, saying that ""elephant bones appear to have the same kind of breaks, It's unlikely they fell out of a tree. "" But the new research focused on ""a small number of breaks"" that are consistent with ""high-energy bone-to-bone influences"" and which differ from the sorts of breaks commonly seen in other collected bones. Kappelman responded in an email, ""These appear to have occurred at or near the time of death."""	['The argument on how Lucy died will continue.']
What type of writing does this passage belong to?	Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well.	['A news report']
What did Paul do after his father died because of the war?	"There was once a young man called Paul in a village in the USA. Paul was very lazy because his father was a rich farmer and he didn't have to work. Mr Smith, a neighbour of his, was a blacksmith . He used to work in his shop all day. Paul spent hours and hours watching how the blacksmith worked every day. ""Young man, why don't you try your hand to make a shoe tack , even it is only to pass the time?"" said the blacksmith one day, "" Maybe it will be useful to you some day."" Finally, the lazy boy began to have a try. After practicing some times, he becameskilledand could make very nice tacks. Years later, Paul's father died and he lost all the things because of a war . He had to move to another country and live by himself. It happened that there were many shoemakers paying high prices to buy tacks for the shoes, because in that part of the country there was a great need of tacks for soldiers' shoes. Paul went to talk with them. He told them that he would make the tacks if they could help him find a workshop in the village. The shoemakers agreed. Then Paul made a lot of money by making tacks. ""How funny it is!"" he said to himself, ""Even by making shoe tacks, one can become rich."""	['He moved to another country.']
When did the writer feel that smoking was bad?	Smoking is harmful to our health, but many middle school students are smoking. Their teachers, parents or classmates can't stop them because they smoke anywhere they can't be seen --on the way to school, in the dormitory , or even in the washroom.And most of the students think that smoking is very cool.But I want to tell you my story and then you will see that it's wrong to smoke when you are very young. When I was a middle school student, my friends at school smoked and they asked me to have a try. So I started smoking when I was fourteen. Soon I couldn't wait to smoke as soon as I was free. After a month I couldn't stop smoking. But two years later, I felt what smoking was doing to me. I couldn't run far, I coughed every morning, and I got very weak. So I wanted to stop smoking. It wasn't easy, but now I have stopped it, and I feel better. If you smoke, you will get ill more easily, and perhaps you can't grow taller, because there is something bad in cigarettes and also you may get some bad behaviors and habits such as stealing , _ and having a fight with others. So you can see smoking is a bad habit. If you smoke, try to stop. Though it isn't easy, you must do it as soon as possible.	['When he was sixteen']
Which of the following statements is TURE?	"I got into the teaching profession by choice. I was then in 9th grade, when my mathematics teacher asked me to take a class for a few students to whom the subject seemed difficult. And believe me, I enjoyed the teaching. I never knew teaching would be so interesting. I loved my freshmen and was delighted to teach my so-called students who came up with lots of good questions. After my post graduation, I worked as a software developer with a public sector in Bangalore for a few years. But I realized that no job could provide me the satisfaction that I experienced while teaching and training. In fact, I feel it was a timely realization for me to choose the teaching profession. I applied to a few colleges, and finally I was chosen as a ""Lecturer"", and I had to lecture graduate and post-graduate students in a college. On the first day, I was nervous thinking that I had to teach the senior classes. But now I can say that taking lectures was one of the best experiences of my life. I was a Computer Science and Information Technology Lecturer, but I tried to help my students with subjects that were not within my domain . It was a new feeling to me every morning before going to the classes. I used to feel energized and excited thinking that the class would be lit up with bright faces to greet me, ""Good morning, Madam"". To me each day was a new beginning, with new feelings, new experiences and new queries . I loved to explore their young minds, read their inquisitive faces when a particular topic seemed tough. It was very challenging to motivate them to take part in the classroom, think critically, question and also respect others' point of view. Though few things never seemed easy, it was very exciting to assure them that they really can. That is the reason, I love to teach."	['The author taught knowledge about various subjects.']
According to the passage, the interviewer, Bruce, was very _ .	I was being interviewed by a senior manager for a big company, I told him honestly that the _ reason that I was interviewing with them was my need to keep my family in Boston. My wife had recently died of a heart attack. A job in Boston would help me reduce some pain for my 16-year-old daughter and me. It was important to me to keep her present high school. Bruce, the interviewer, was politely kind, but he didn't search any further. He acknowledged my loss and, with great respect, moved on to another subject. After the next round of interviews, Bruce took me to lunch with another manager. Then he asked me to take a walk with him. He told me that he had lost his wife. And, like me, he had also been married 20 years and had 3 children. I realized that he had experienced the same pain as I had and it was almost impossible to explain to someone who had not lost a loved one. He offered his business card and home phone number and suggested that, should I need help or just want someone to talk to, I should feel free to give him a call. Whether I got the job or not, he wanted me to know that he was there if I ever needed help. From that one act of kindness, when he had no idea if we could ever see each other again, he helped our family deal with one of life's greatest losses. He turned the normally cold business interview process into an act of caring and supporting for another person in a time of extreme need.	['kind']
The best way for parents to have their baby eat properly is to _ .	"Remember, from the moment they are born, our children have the ability to know when they are hungry - and they cry to let us know too! Of course, they also cry to let us know they are wet, hurt, or bored, but we soon learn to tell the difference and try to meet each need somehow. When we begin to feed them solid foods, they let us know when they have had enough by turning away from the spoon - or refusing the food back at us! Why is it that once children are old enough to sit at the table their parents are often heard bargaining with them or threatening them to finish all their dinner? When we make our children eat up the plate that we filled, we don't pay attention to their born ability to know how much, and what, their bodies need. Instead, we should allow them to use their own hunger feelings to determine how much they need, while we provide a balance of nutritious and ""fun"" foods. When we teach them about moderation and set a great example by living an active, healthy lifestyle, they will be less likely to develop weight problems later in life. Think of your slim friend who eats whatever she wants -but will refuse ice cream if she has had enough to eat! ""Eat all your dinner if you want dessert"" translates to ""you must overeat so I will reward you by letting you overeat some more!"" By using sweets as a reward for good behavior, kids begin to believe sweets are really special and they may want them even more. Instead, by making dessert just another (small) part of an enjoyable meal, kids learn to ""save room for dessert"" instead of becoming a member of the ""clean plate club."""

According to the passage, you can visit the US State Department's travel website to find _ .	"Getting sick overseas can be scary. You're in an unfamiliar place and often don't speak the language. Although each trip is different, there are universal things you can do to keep safe. Be prepared. ""Schedule a visit with a doctor who specializes in travel or the area you're visiting at least four weeks before your departure,"" says WHO public health expert Dr. Gilles Poumerol. A travel doctor will be able to give you the required and recommended vaccinations as well as discuss any medical issues you may come across abroad. Get insurance. ""In many countries where you have limited access to health care, good health care is only found in the private sector and can be very expensive,"" Dr. Poumerol says. Plus, in an emergency, returning to the United States can cost more than $50,000. Ask your health insurance company whether your policy applies overseas and whether it will cover trips to a foreign hospital. If not, there are many companies that offer short-term travel health insurance for a reasonable fee. A list can be found on the US State Department's travel website. Ks5u Pack well. Dr. Poumerol also suggests bringing a note from your doctor in English and the language of the country you're visiting. Packing an emergency contact list is important. Contacts should include the local embassy , s who should be informed if you get sick and your health insurance company. Be care. You have to be in charge of your health. If you're being treated abroad, question the medical staff about their sterilization practices; injection equipment should be put in boiling water for at least 30 minutes or used only once. Also be sure that doctors and nurses are wearing gloves to prevent fluid transfer. Limiting your alcohol intake will keep you focused on your safety. If your common sense is perfect, the rest of your body should follow."	['which companies offer short-term travel health insurance']
The writer thinks that the U.S.government's definition for the homeless reveals _ .	"According to the United States government, people are classified as homeless if they have no place to stay and no expectation of finding a place for the next thirty days.Although technically accurate, that is an impersonal assessment of an enormous and very human problem. The homeless population represents all of us Americans.It includes men and women, the elderly, children, and infants.Its members are from all ethnic groups.What they have in common is poverty. Currently in the U.S., thirty-nine million people live in poverty.When money is really tight, paying the rent or buying food often becomes a choice.Government assistance in the form of food stamps does help but, as one homeless man explains, you can't pay the rent with food stamps. With no money for rent, the streets and homeless shelters become the alternative. Although men constitute the largest group within the homeless population, homeless women with children are rapidly joining them.In fact, one quarter of the homeless people in the U.S.are teenagers and young children. People may become homeless for numerous reasons.However, there are certain factors that many of these individuals have in common.They include a lack of adequate education and job skills.A majority of the teenagers and adults have not completed high school. The abuse of alcohol and drugs is also a common factor.One third of the adult homeless population abuses alcohol.While one quarter of the same group uses drugs. Some members of this population suffer mental health problems.Within the past several years many institutions for the mentally ill have been closed and their patients sent ""home"".Unfortunately, a number of those people have no home to go to and they are unable to adequately look after themselves. Job loss in today's economy has also become a real factor in the loss of people's homes.The breakup of families through abandonment and divorce are also contributing factors, particularly when there are children involved.The parent who is left to care for the kids with inadequate income may be forced to depend on the homeless shelters to put a roof over their heads."

His mother and sisters were busy and none of them said anything. The mother went upstairs after she had finished washing and shortened the pants two inches. But she didn't tell her daughters about it. Later on, after supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's pants. So she went upstairs without saying to anyone, and shortened the pants two inches. The younger sister went to the cinema, but when she came back, she also remembered what her brother had said. So she ran upstairs, and took two inches off the legs of the new pants"	['Six.']

What kind of people need less sleep according to the research?	Wake Up,Sleep Gene Some people can stay up all night and still get work done the next day.I'm not one of them.After a night without enough sleep,I feel bad-tempered.I have trouble remembering things.And all I want to do is crawl back into bed and sleep. How do you feel after you've stayed up late to finish schoolwork? Or the day after an overnight party? Scientists now say that your answers to these questions may depend on your genes. New research suggests that a gene called period 3 affects how well you function without sleep.The period 3 gene comes in two forms: short and long.Everyone has two copies of the gene.So,you may have two longs,two shorts,or one of each.Your particular combination depends on what your parents passed on to you. Scientists from the University of Surrey in England studied 24 people who had either two short or two long copies of period 3.Study participants had to stay awake for 40 hours straight.Then,they took tests that measured how quickly they pushed a button when number flashed on a screen and how well they could remember lists of numbers. Results showed that the people with the short form of period 3 performed much better on these tests than the people with the long form did.In both groups,people performed worst in the early morning.That's the time when truck drivers and other night-shift workers say they have the most trouble concentrating. After the first round of experiments,participants were finally allowed to sleep.People in the group that performed well on the tests took about 18 minutes to nod off. People with the long period 3 genes,by contrast,fell asleep in just 8 minutes.They also spent more time in dip sleep.That suggests that people with the long form of the gene need more and deeper sleep to keep their brains working at top form. I think I must have the long form of period 3.What about you?	['Those with two short copies of the gene']

During the short trial period of the electronic arms and legs, Nick realized that even with them, he was still unlike his peers at school, and they turned out to be much too heavy for Nick to operate, affecting his flexibility quite significantly. ""When I was 13 I read a newspaper article about a disabled man who had managed to achieve great things and help others,"" said Nick, ""I realized why God had made us like this - to give hope to others. It was so inspirational to me that I decided to use my life to encourage others and decided to be thankful for what I do have, not get angry about what I don't.""

In the USA, who thinks mobile phones are more than phone calls?	Many children think mobile phones are cool. They come in fun colours and you can talk with a friend anytime and anywhere. In the USA, more than 90 million people use mobile phones. Many of those people are children. For children, mobile phones are more than phone calls. They are fashionable. Most mobile phone users don't think about the health problems caused by mobile phones. Some scientists say that mobile phones give off radiation that might be bad for users. One recent study shows that mobile phone radiation might raise a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer. Other scientists say mobile phones are not bad for people's health. They say that they didn't find any link between mobile phone use and cancer. Scientists say that people can protect themselves from mobile phone radiation. One way is to use an earphone, or people can make shorter calls.	['children']

What does this passage mainly talk about?	A star usually is someone who has become famous in sports, film, or pop music, someone like singer Michael Jackson. In the middle nineteen eighties, Michael Jackson successfully made a famous record, which quickly became the most popular recording in the history of music. This made Michael Jackson a bright star. One of the famous sports bright stars in the United States is Mohammed Ali. When he was a young man, he won a gold medal in the Olympic Games as a boxer. Then, he won first place in the world heavy weight boxing match. Before long, he was known as one of the greatest and most famous boxers in sports history. Everyone knows his name.

In the end Joe was unhappy about his friendship with Fred because _	"Joe Bloggs always had a cigarette on his lips. He smoked while he read, while he watched TV, and while he drank a cup of coffee. He smoked forty cigarettes a day, but he was happy. Joe's friend, Fred Brown, said to him, ""It is very bad to smoke"". When Joe heard this , he started to worry and became so thin that he went to Fred for help. Fred said , ""You must eat more"". O Joe did not smoke , but he ate chocolate , and he became very fat. Again he went to Fred for help. Fred said , "" You must not eat chocolate"". So Joe stopped eating chocolate , but he went back to smoking cigarettes. He became thin again but he was not happy, because he still smoked. Sometimes Joe Bloggs wished Fred Brown was not his friend!"	['he in fact had never really understood what Fred meant']
Bill Gates was fooled mainly because _ .	"MONTREAL--He may be the world's richest man, but that didn't prevent Bill Gates from falling for an April Fool's day joke by two Quebec radio comics pretending to be Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Montreal French-language station CKMF--FM said last Wednesday that staffers Marcantoine Audet and Sebastien Trudel had a 10-minute telephone chat with Microsoft Corp boss Gates on April 1. The broadcast was aired on their nightly show last Tuesday and repeated last Wednesday. ""We were happy. We had been calling Microsoft persistently for four weeks,"" Trudel said. Trudel said he and his colleague had already fooled Canadian pop singer Celine Dion and Formula One driver Jacques Villeneuve on their show. ""This time, we wanted to give ourselves a challenge with somebody more difficult to reach,"" Ttudel said. He said he was surprised that Gates's assistants did not check to see if it was really the prime minister's office on the line. Trudel said they imitated Chretien's heavily accented English, talking about the economy, asking about Microsoft's Windows operating system and inviting the multibillionaire to visit a well-known Montreal strip joint . The radio host said that Gates was not amused by the fake interview. ""He did not seem angry but he did not find it so funny,"" the comic said."

What does the passage talk about?	The technology is improving every year. We will see some very exciting home robots in the next few years. In the future the robots can do lots of things. 1. Getting things In a few years, it will be possible to tell your home robot to get a piece of bread for you. The robot will use its eyes and an arm to get the bread for you. 2. Watering plants Future robots will carry water to water plants. 3. Telling dangers A home robot will find out fire, smoke and other dangers easily. Every night the robot will make its rounds to make sure that everything is right. 4. Looking after children A robot will help us look after our children well while we are not at home.

The Guide Horse Foundation _ .	Many blind people use guide dogs to help them get safely from place to place and to warn them of danger. But what can blind people do if they are allergic to dogs or just don't like them? For these people, they can turn to the Guide Horse Foundation. Janet and Don Burleson founded the organization in 1999. They began training miniature horses to help guide blind people. Miniature horses look just like common horses, only much smaller. They are generally less than 34 inches tall. Cuddles was the foundation's first guide horse in full service. She became 45-year-old Dan Shaw's helper. Shaw has an eye disease and his sight is very poor. One night, while filling out a form to get a guide dog, Shaw heard a news story on TV about people training horses to guide the blind. Shaw loves horses and wanted a guide animal that would live a long time. So he applied ,and a year later, Cuddles and Shaw began training as a team. On a trip to New York, Cuddles helped Shaw safely visit many places of interest .They even traveled on a boat and on the subway system. Shaw says that he is very lucky to have Cuddles. He believes that Cuddles has changed his life for the better by giving him the chance to do things himself and making him feel much more confident about himself.

What reason did Jane think the policeman came for?	"The week after Jane's birthday, Barbara and Mary were away. Jane decided to have a late birthday party. She telephoned several friends. She asked some to bring records, some to bring food and others to bring something to drink. She rang another friend to see if she could borrow his record player. She herself bought some food and drink to get the party going. She took up all the carpets so that they could dance. She did not know whether Barbara and Mary would have approved , but as long as she was careful, she was sure that they would not mind. She warned the two people in the flat above and invited them down. ""Oh, "" said Jane, surprised. ""What's all this about? "" The first guests arrived soon after eight. The music was soon playing loudly and they started dancing. Some of Jane's friends brought other friends with them. As more and more people arrived,the noise increased. People started shouting at each other, so they turned the music up. This made it more difficult to hear each other above the music, so they shouted more loudly. At half past ten the bell rang. ""Turn down the music!"" someone shouted. ""Someone probably called the police."" When Jane opened the door, there was a policeman standing there. She started to apologize, ""I'm sorry about all the noise, officer. But you see, it was my birthday last week and I'm having a party."" ""Never mind about that, miss. We're here because of something much more important."" ""Well, there's been a report of burglary . We think the thief may have come to your party, pretending to be a friend of someone here.

From the passage, we can know which is wrong.	"1Forests help to keep water from running away, so drought does not often happen. The trees in the forests can keep raindrops from hitting the soil directly, and the dead leaves on the ground can also keep the water from running away.2 Chinese people don't want to see more floods and droughts. We have built the "" Great Green Wall"" of trees across the northern part of our country.3 Thanks to the "" Great Green Wall"", we can prevent the wind from blowing the earth away. It will stop the sand from moving towards the rich farmland. That's why more "" Great Green Walls"" are needed. Trees must be planted all over the world.4 ,A, B, C, D,. (10)"	['It is not necessary that trees must be planted all over the world.']
What will social networking websites do?	In the past, friendships were greatly limited by time, space and attention; increasing home and workplace mobility has made it even harder to keep social relations over time. Through a combination of user controls, new technologies and changing standards of social behavior, Facebook is freeing us from these limitations, making friendships more accessible, pleasant and diverse than ever before. First, Facebook allows you to find and rediscover friends and then reminds you of these connections, so that you are less likely to fall out of touch with the long-lost school friend, or the family member in a different country. 'Second, Facebook creates an environment that allows you to interact easily with others : you can share your photos,videos,links and thoughts with your friends, and respond to what they share in turn. Third, Facebook's unique technical system helps you to discover your friends,most valuable stories. These technologies allow people to keep and enrich friendships that they might otherwise have been unable to keep. The effect of this is very great. A recent study by Keith Hampton for the Pew Internet and American Life Project discovered that users of social networking websites have larger, more diverse social circles, online and offline. This outcome comes at no cost to one's closest relationships, which are kept in person and over the phone. Instead, the hour that the average user spends each day socializing on Facebook comes at the expense of less social activities, such as the three or so hours a day the average person spends watching television. Time may limit our ability to keep social ties, but our desire for social communication is limitless. Just as boats have allowed us to cross oceans and vehicles have allowed us to move mountains, Facebook is a tool that allows us to stay more deeply connected with a larger and more diverse set of friends.

Some people belittle Little Shenyang's humor because _ .	"Even if he is not the most liked comedian in China today, his popularity certainly has risen the fastest within the last two months. He's ""Little Shenyang"", who came into national fame overnight after his appearance on CCTV's Spring Festival Gala. With his funny cross-dressing, unique northeastern accent and superb imitative skills, Little Shenyang has obvious talent to support his rise to fame. Hundreds of video clips of his shows have been posted on YouTube and other online video sites, and his performance fees reportedly grew 50-fold in just a few weeks. He has, at the same time, become one of the most controversial of entertainers. Many have doubted his artistic potential, pointing out that his shows were repetitive and lacked creativity, a key to continued comedic success. Others belittle the style of humor, saying it's too crude and appeals only to less-educated people. His defenders were just as up in arms. Many media commentators and bloggers said that his quick rise to star proved the broad appeal of his art form. He became a national champion not because of his ""northeastern hick "" humor, they argued, but because he represented something new on TV, something with a grassroots feel that appealed to millions of ordinary people. Now, does Little Shenyang really deserve his star status?"	['The style of humor lacked creativity.']
Where did street art begin?	Street art is very popular around the world. You can find it on buildings, street signs and trash cans from Tokyo to Paris, from Moscow to Cape Town. Street art has become a global culture and even art museums are collecting the works of street artists. People have different opinions about street art. Some think it is bad, but others think it is a very beautiful new culture. Street art began in New York in the 1960s. This style of drawing and writing became know as graffiti. Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel against the rules. They traveled around cities to make paintings that everyone could see. One well-known New York street artist is Swoon. She cuts paper pictures of people and puts them on walls. Swoon didn't start as street artist. She studied art but, later, got bored with the works she saw in museums. Then she fell in love with graffiti. The people in New York enjoy Swoon's style. Some museums have already bought some of her works. Street artists do their work for some reasons. A number of them choose street art because it is closer to the everyday life. Nowadays the Internet has a big influence on street art. Artists can show their pictures to people around the world. Many people in the city, however, say that seeing a picture on the Internet is never as good as seeing it live .	['In New York.']
The price of the knives was cut down by half because _ .	"Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: "" The customer is always right."""	['knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory.']
According to the text, when you want to make friends with someone, _ .	"A good first impression is important. So, how do you, when you're meeting someone for the first time, make certain he or she doesn't get the wrong image of you? A study concluded that the first 30 seconds make or break the connection between two people when they meet for the first time. Another study conducted by UCLA found that ""people evaluate one another by using the three V's: visual (appearance), vocal (voice) and verbal (what you say)."" Before you head out on your next date to meet someone new, let's concentrate on these areas: *How others will see you. (Visual) Are you dressed well? Do you look like this date is important to you? Did you take some time with your appearance? Watch your manners: people don't like bad manners. *How others will hear you. (Vocal) Is your voice too soft? You might come across as insecure. If you speak softly, make an effort to speak clearly -- don't make your date have to work to hear you. *What others will hear you say. (Verbal) People have a natural desire to connect -- let them know you're interested in what they have to say by repeating it back to them. Don't say the same thing everyone else is saying."	['you should try to master  the first few seconds']
According lothe passage,what can defend the parents' child rearing?	"What is the main testing ground of fears about incomplete or inadequate child reariry? The college admission process. If you are afraid you don't discipline your children enough,the evidence of parental failure is right there in front of everyone. The child is not filling out her college applications ! lf you are afraid that you have allowed your children to watch too much television and settle for low grades,you will have to answer for the consequences. The over-involvement of many parents in the process is,from my perspective,a cover for this deep parental anxiety: Did I do a good job with this child? Did I do everything I needed to do for this child? Is this child going to have a good life? I have seen manv parents,dive back into their children's lives at college admission time, trying to fill all of their wisdom and discipline into their children at the last moment. Parents may need to be sure as their children leave the nest that they reall} have taught them how to fly. Since it is impossible to assess the quality of what parents have done for their children at this point,the next best thing is the status of the colege to which the child is admitted. From the point of an anxious parent,an ""Ivy l,eague college"" child is proof of better child rearing than a ""small college"" child. I once sat with a talented,weak senior girl and her brilliant parents. She,they,and the school had to decide whether she should remam m school or go into a hospital. In light of her anorexia( ) ,the school recommended strongly that she not file her early application to Princeton. Upon hearing this,the girl looked at the adults in the room and said,""If I can't apply early to Princeton,l'll die. "" Her parents were also eager to have her get into Princeton. Why did they all need this so desperately? Because,in this case,something was wrong in the family. Due to some weakness in her upbringing,this child was not happy or self-confident. Yet she was eighteen,the culture required her to leave home. The psychological solution for them all was the comforting vision of a great college. Somehow going there would make her life fine and defend her parents' child rearing. Such fears about letting go of an unfmished child exist in all families. How can we let go of a child who is still so young in so many ways? It is painful and has no cure except time and hope. For parents looking for a painkiller,the college admission process is where they can work out their anxieties."	['A great college.']

The writer now doesn't think her father _ .	Dear Daddy, You've been gone for six years and I've had time to think. Now I'm ready to write this letter to you. For a long time after Mom died, I thought I liked her more because I didn't like your attitude and I thought that her softer side was more desirable. In my 15-year-old's mind, I thought you could have stopped my mother from drinking herself to death. Instead, you were off playing tennis and working. Later, I realized that no one could make someone stop drinking. Support is important, but at the end of the day, it is a choice. You were just doing your best. What I have learned is that I am much like you. You taught me self-confidence. I know if I am prepared to work hard enough for something, I will be successful. This is no small thing. What I've realized since you died is that you were always there for me. You fought to ensure that I got my place on the Quebec badminton team that I had earned. When I got divorced , you came up to see if I had what I needed to take care of the boys and you paid off my car. You taught me not to spend money I don't have. I've always kept to that rule. It has served me well. We always had a good home to live in, nice vacations, and everything we needed and most of what we wanted. You were not a perfect parent and neither am I. My children are much more thankful than I ever was. I am thankful that I had you as my dad. I am still Daddy's girl and I am proud of it.	"[""was responsible for her mother's death""]"
This passage tells us _ .	"Do you want to know how and why a fall leaf changes color? We first have to understand what leaves are and what they do. Leaves are the world's food factories. Plants take water from the ground through their roots and take CO2from the air. Plants use sunlight to turn water and CO2into glucose , a kind of sugar. Plants use it as food for energy and growing. A chemical called _ in the leaves gives plants their green colour. As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter, and trees ""know"" to begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough sunlight or water. Trees rest during this time and live on the food they store during the summer. They begin to shut down their food-making factories. As the green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves, we begin to see yellow and orange leaves. The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in autumn. In some trees, like maples , sunlight and the cool nights of autumn turn the glucose in the leaves into a red colour. And we can enjoy the beautiful red leaves during autumn."	['not all the colors of the leaves are from chlorophyll']
Why was the man put into prison?	"A man accused of failing to return more than 700 children's books to five different libraries in the county was released from prison after a book publisher agreed to post his bond of $1,000.The publisher said.""There's a story here.This is a man who loves books.He just can't let go of them.He hasn't stolen a single book.So what's the crime ? We think that Mr.Banish has story to tell.We plan to publish his story."" When asked why he didn't return the books, Mr.Banish said,""Well,how could I? They became family to me.I was afraid to return them,because I knew that kids or dogs would get hold of these books and chew them up,throw them around,tear the pages,spill soda on them,get jelly on them,and drown them in the toilet. He continued,""Books are people,too! They talk to you,they take care of you,and they enrich you with wisdom,humor and love.A book is a guest in my home.How could I kick it out? I repaired tor n pages.I dusted them with a soft clean cloth.I turned their pages so they could breathe and get some fresh air.""

Which of the following words can best describe a manager's image in the author's mind?	In prison you spend the majority of your time in an 8*10 cell. At work you spend most of your time in a 6*8 cubicle . In prison you get three meals a day. At work you only get a break for one meal and you have to pay for it.

At work you get fired for watching TV and playing games (or being on the Internet). In prison you get your own toilet. At work you have to share. In prison they allow your family and friends to visit. At work you cannot even speak to your family and friends. In prison all expenses are paid by taxpayers with no work required. At work you get to pay all the expenses to go to work and then they deduct taxes from your salary to pay for prisoners.

From the passage we learn that Kindle is a device which _ .	Dear Customers, I love slipping into a comfortable chair for a long read, as I relax into the chair. I also relax into the author's words, stories, and ideas. The physical book is so elegant that it disappears into the background, and what remains is the author's world. Today, we at Amazon are excited to announce Kindle, a wireless, portable reading device with instant access to more than 90,000 books, magazines, and newspapers. We've been working on Kindle for more than three years. Our top design objective was for Kindle to disappear in your hands --to get out of the way --so you can enjoy your reading. We also wanted to go beyond the physical book. Kindle is wireless, so whether you're lying in bed or riding a train, you can think of a book, and have it in less than 60 seconds. No computer is needed--you do your reading directly from the device. We chose the same wireless technology used in advanced mobile phones. But unlike mobile phones, there are no monthly wireless bills, no service or data plans, and no yearly contracts. There is no software to install(,). We want you to get lost in your reading and not in the technology. Kindle uses a new kind of display called electronic paper. Sharp and natural with no strong light, reading on Kindle is nothing like reading from a computer screen. Kindle weighs only 10.3 ounces --less than a paperback --but can carry two hundred books. Enjoy learning about Kindle and many thanks!	['can find a book within one minute']
Why was the author puzzled when he got the prize?	The Enzian Art House in Florida was showing movies in the park. One evening, a few weeks before Christmas, they showed The Christmas Storyand had a raffle with a girl's bike as the prize. It was attractive with color1ed streamers , flowers' butterflies, a fascinating bell, all designed to delight a five-year-old girl. But I, who was fifty, won it! This led to a bit of a puzzle as 1 didn't have kids or grandchildren to give it to. I wanted the bike to go to someone who didn't have the opportunity to own such a wonderful thing. I contacted the shelter (where I occasionally volunteered in the kitchen) and while there was a big need for a sweet bike, there was also the potential for it to create conflict. I sought else where until I found out about a couple in our church who had been going through hard times in their marriage because of drugs and alcohol. They walked to our church (they didn't have a car) from a parking lot a mile away and they had a sweet little five-year-old daughter. On Christmas Eve I went to their parking lot. They had already left on foot to go to the candle lighting service. Their landlord was on the parking lot and when he heard that 1 wanted to leave the bike anonymously he offered to open up their trailer .There I saw a lone tree, so I put the bike behind it. It was a great moment for me and, I hope, a little bit of Christmas magic for the family and that little girl.	"[""He didn't have kids about five years old to offer the bike to.""]"
What do you learn about Douglas from the passage?	"On Thanksgiving Day, a teacher asked her class of firstgraders to draw a picture of something they were thankful for. She thought that these children from poor families actually had little to be thankful for. And she found most of them drawing pictures of flowers or tables with food. The teacher was very surprised to see the picture Douglas handed in. It's a hand,a simple hand. But whose hand? The class were very interested in the strange picture. ""I think it must be the hand of God that brings us food,"" said one child, ""A farmer's,"" said another, ""Because he grows beautiful flowers. "" Finally when the others were at work ,the teacher went over to Douglas' desk and asked whose hand it was. ""It's your hand, Teacher,"" he said quietly and shyly. She remembered that she had often taken Douglas, a dirty lonely child, by the hand while having a class break. She often did that with the children. But it meant so much to Douglas. Perhaps this is everyone's thanksgiving,not for the material things we get,but for the chance,in whatever small way, to give to others."	['His family was not rich.']
What does the writer's father do?	More and more Chinese people care for their own health. I come from England. I came to China five years ago. I began to learn cooking Chinese food from my father. When I was fifteen, I began to help my mother in the kitchen. My father is a very famous cook in Beijing. So he taught me many things about cooking. In the past three years, I never stopped learning cooking. When I saw a book called The disease eating out can be gone back again by eating (<<>> ), I began studying the book. .The writer of the book is Zhang Wuben. He said he was a famous nutritionist and well-known traditional Chinese doctor. He asked the people to eat eggplant and gram . In China, Zhang Wuben's book has been popular in the past few years. My father was invited to talk about the book in May, 2010. A large number of Chinese people believe they should eat eggplant and gram to be healthy. I have visited a lot of Chinese restaurants in Beijing and studied hundreds of restaurant menus. I talked to lots of doctors about eating and nutrition . They thought that Zhang Wuben's words _ the science. He told a lie. The fact is that it's important for us to eat a balanced diet and not just to eat eggplant and gram.	['A cook.']

Here he explain himself (using his voice); ""We've become so accustomed to noise, there's almost a deep prejudice against the idea that silence might be beneficial, if you tell someone to be quiet ,you sound like an old man. But it's never been important to find continuing quiet. Silence focuses us, improves our health, and is a key to lasting peace and satisfaction."" ""We need to excite people about the sounds you start to hear, if you merely quiet things down a little. During a Japanese tea ceremony ,the smallest sounds become a kind of art the spoons making a light ringing sound on a bowl, the edges of a kimono brushing against the floor. ""Deaf people are very attentive in almost every aspect of life. If two deaf people are walking together, using sign language, they constantly watch out for each other and protect each other by paying steady attention to the other. They are connected yet also fully aware of their surroundings. Even deaf teenagers! We in the hearing world can learn from them.

What is the main idea of this passage?	Cheerleaders arc part of athletic competitions throughout the United States. As their name says they lead the crowd in cheering for the team it likes best. About five years ago. cheerleaders were considered to be simply entertainers. Today there is much more Cheerleading in America which has become another form of athletic competition. Cheerleaders today are expected to be gymnasts and dancers. They 'are expected to be quick and strong. Many . cheerleaders are better athletes than the boys and girls on sports teams. High school cheerleading especially has become more difficult. The students must be in top physical shape. They must be able to jump high, turn circles in the air and lift each other. Teachers say this is the result of the influence of college cheerleaders. High school students watch college football and basketball games on TV. They see how the cheerleaders throw each other into the air and perform difficult athletic movements. They want to do the same thing. There is one big difference between the two groups. however. College cheerleaders in America are young men and women. The men do most of the lifting. At most high schools only girls are cheerleaders. It's very difficult for them to hold others on their shoulders and throw them into the air. There are a number of ways high school cheerleaders are improving their skills. They are exercising and lifting weights to increase their strength. And they are attending camps during the summer holidays to learn new techniques. Cheerleaders test their skills by taking part in competitions against cheerleaders from other schools. just like other athletes. Coaches at some high schools say this new kind of athletic cheer leading has caused some problems . They say girls who were soccer and basketball players are now competing for places on a cheer leading team. As more girls attempt to become cheerleaders, sports teams suffer from a lack of good players.	['What makes good cheerleaders and how they work.']
What is the passage mainly about?	When it comes to success in business and success in life, there are few qualities as important as confidence. People naturally have different levels of confidence.Some have a higher level of confidence than others do, but even those whose confidence is lacking can learn to build their level of confidence and reach their most important goals.Increasing self confidence is one of the most common reasons people give for seeking the help of psychologists and other professionals. One of the many places where a greater level of confidence is useful is in the workplace.We all know how difficult it can be, for instance, to ask the boss for a raise.This process can be extremely difficult for those who lack confidence in their own abilities.After all, if you are unsure about your own abilities, how will you ever convince your boss that you deserve more money for the work you do? Even if you are not asking for that big raise, having plenty of confidence in your abilities is important to success.If you are certain of your abilities, chances are that those around you, whether they are your coworkers, your colleagues or your superiors, will see that confidence, and that will help to assure them that you are the best at what you do. Being thought of as the person to go to, and being seen as an expert in your chosen field, is naturally very important to success on the job.If you can make yourself the person people go to for guidance and advice, you will help to protect yourself from the ever present danger of downsizing .After all, if you are a recognized expert at the office, you will be regarded as an indispensable member of the team. Having a high level of confidence, after all, does not mean overlooking the places where you could improve.Knowing what you do well and where you need help will help you enjoy increased success and confidence.

It can be inferred that the slaves in the same ship _ .	"During the early years of American settlement, a new form of English was beginning to develop in the islands of the West Indies and the southern part of the mainland, spoken by the black population. The beginning of the seventeenth century saw the happening of the slave trade. Ships from Europe travelled to the West African coast, where they exchanged cheap goods for black slaves. The slaves were shipped in terrible conditions to the Caribbean islands and the American coast, where they were in turn exchanged for such products as sugar and molasses . The ships then returned to England, completing an ""Atlantic triangle""of journeys, and the process began again. Britain and the United States had outlawed the slave trade by 1865, but by that time, nearly 200 years of trading had taken place. By the middle of the nineteenth century, there were over four million black slaves in America. The policy of the slave-traders was to bring people of different language backgrounds together in the ships, to make it difficult for groups to plan rebellion. The result was the growth of several pidgin forms of communication, and in particular a pidgin between the slaves and the sailors many of whom spoken English. Once arriving in the Caribbean, this pidgin English continued to act as a major means of communication between teh black population and the new landowners, and among the blacks themselves. Then, when children came to be born, the pidgin became their mother tongue, thus producing the first black Creole speech in the region. This Creole English rapidly came to be used throughout the cotton plantations , and in the coastal towns and islands."	['spoke different languages']
What was the good news for the lady?	"On a flight from Johannesburg, a middle-aged rich white South African lady had found herself sitting next to a black man. She called the cabin crew attendant over to complain about her seat. ""What seems to be the problem, Madam?"" asked the attendant. ""Can't you see?"" She said, ""You have seated me next to a black person! I can't possibly sit next to this kind of person. Find me another seat!"" ""Please calm down, Madam,"" the stewardess replied. ""The flight is very full today, but I will tell you what I will do---- I will go and check to see if we have any seats available in club or first class."" The woman glanced at the angry black man beside her. A few minutes later, the stewardess returned with the good news, which she delivered to the lady. ""Madam, unfortunately, as I expected, economy is full. I have spoken to the cabin services director, and club is also full. However, we do have one seat in first class."" Before the lady had a chance to answer, the stewardess continued, ""It is most extraordinary to make this kind of upgrade, however, and I have had to get special permission from the captain. But, learning this condition, the captain felt that it was shocking that someone should be forced to sit next to such a tiring person."" Having said that, the stewardess turned to the black man sitting next to the lady, and said, ""So if you'd like to get you things, sir, I have your seat ready for you..."" At this point, obviously the surrounding passengers stood and gave an applause while the black man walked up to the front of the plane."	['They have one seat in first class.']

You can call me Bryan Anderson."" After he fixed the car, the lady wanted to pay him. But Bryan said no. He said if she really wanted to pay him back, the next time she saw someone who needed help, she could give that person the help he or she needed. A few miles down the road the lady went into a small cafe. The waitress came over. The lady noticed the waitress was nearly eight months pregnant , but she never let it change her attitude when she served her. The lady finished her meal and paid with a $100 bill. The waitress went to get the change. When she came back, she found the lady had gone and left a note on a piece of paper: ""You don't owe me anything. Somebody once helped me the way I'm helping you. If you really want to pay me back, here is what you do: Do not let the love end with you."" Under the paper were four more $100 bills. The waitress was moved.

From the passage we know that a yenta _ .	"Neighborhood yentas are well--known women. They spend most of their time watching people around them. The yentas have this title for this. ""Yenta"" is a Yiddish word. It means a trouble maker or a talkative person. Nobody in the street is safe from their eyes or tongue. Yentas certainly are not bad people. They pass on messages and advice. They give _ weather reports. They know who is doing what. They see,hear,and know all and usually repeat it. They have called themselves reporters.

The supper was ready at _ .	"The Beets were a new couple . The things in their rooms, such as the television, the computer, the fridge, furniture and so on, were all left by their parents.

""Why not?"" ""I ran after it so that I saved two dollars this evening."" ""That's great!"" the woman said happily. ""Run after a taxi next time and you'll save both more time and money."""	['7:15']
American and British spy agencies were both particularly interested in the information gathered from _ .	"The NSA and GCHQ are tapping popular smart phone apps such as Angry Birds to gather the enormous amounts of very personal data those bits of software collect--including age, gender, marital status, income, education level and more, according to new reports from the New York Times and The Guardian. Citing secret documents provided by Edward Snowden, former NSA staff, the reports detail efforts to gain data collection from cell phone carriers and smart phones by tapping into ""leaky"" apps themselves. Both spy agencies showed a particular interest in Google Maps, which is accurate to within a few yards or better in some locations and would clearly pass along data about the area where phone owner is. ""It effectively means that anyone using Google Maps on a smartphone is working in support of a GCHQ system,"" reads a secret 2008 report by the NSA's sister spy agency, according to the New York Times. More surprising is the wide range of apps that the agencies search for data, including innocent-seeming apps such as Angry Birds. One document in particular from GCHQ listed what information can be found from which apps, mentioning Android apps but suggesting the same data was available from the iPhone platform. Angry Birds maker Rovio Entertainment of Finland said it had no knowledge of any NSA or GCHQ programs for tapping into its users' data. ""Rovio doesn't have any previous knowledge of this matter, and have not been aware of such activity in 3rd party advertising networks,"" said Saara Bergstrom. ""Nor do we have any involvement with the organizations you mentioned."" Mobile photos uploaded to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter appear to be a particularly rich source of information for the spy agencies as well. Metadata in the photos is briefly available. The NSA and GCHQ are able to tap into that metadata to collect a wealth of key data points about a person's life. ""NSA does not profile everyday Americans as it carries out its foreign intelligence mission,"" the agency told the Times in response to questions about the program. During a Monday press conference, White House press secretary Jay Carney stressed that same position. ""As the president said in his Jan. 17 speech, to the extent data is collected by the NSA, through whatever means, we are not interested in the communications of people who are not valid foreign intelligence targets and we are not after the information of ordinary Americans,"" he said."

What do you think is the official color1 of St. Patrick's Day?	"On Saturday, millions of people around the world will celebrate Saint Patrick's Day, which honors Patron Saint(a main religious figure)of Ireland. Communities across the United States will host parades , parties, and other festivities to mark the occasion. This year, cities like Boston, New York, and Chicago have organized big events celebrating Saint Patrick's Day. In New York City, hundreds of thousands of people will gather to watch the Saint Patrick's Day parade-the nation's largest. It is one of the most watched parades in the world. Last year, almost 2 million watched it , more than 150,000 took part in it and they filled the streets. The parade, first held in 1776, is also one of the oldest. Chicago also throws a big celebration. Every year, the Chicago River, which crosses the city, shines green as event organizers pour about 40 pounds of fluorescence, a powerful dye , into the water. Boston keeps its parade rolling for three hours or more. It is the nation's second-largest parade. The city will also show respect to one of its most famous former residents, President John F. Kennedy, by opening the exhibit ""A Journey Home:John F. Kennedy and Ireland"", at his official library. Patron Saint lived in Britain in the early fifth century, when it was still part of the Roman Empire. He was caught and sold into slavery in Ireland when he was only 16. He finally escaped slavery and turned to a life of religious devotion. He trained to become a minister and set out to spread Christianity throughout Ireland. After 30 years as a religious leader, Patrick died on March 17, 1461. Saint Patrick's Day is always celebrated on March 17. In Ireland, it is an official holiday."	['Green.']
The passage lists many factors that cause asthma attacks except _ .	Jeremy Wirick, 9, has been back in school for less than two months, but he has already had several asthma attacks. A recent attack happened on October 2, after he pushed himself too hard in gym class. Running, power walking, jogging and push-ups took their toll. When Jeremy got home an hour or two later, he was out of breath. He needed to use a nebulizer, a machine that helps send medicine quickly to the lungs, to get his breathing back to normal. Asthma attacks like Jeremy increase in September and October. More than six times as many asthma sufferers who are elementary-school age need hospital treatment in the fall as in the summer. Experts believe many factors can contribute to back-to-school asthma. Kids get together in close spaces, they start passing viruses around. A viral infection can cause an asthma attack. There are also certain fall allergies that can cause attacks. Exercise is another common cause of an attack. Besides, the stress of school can make asthma worse. Parents can play a big role in helping kids with asthma start the school year right. Dawne Gee's10-year-old son, Alexander, has had asthma since he was a baby. Before the school year starts, she tells school workers in writing about her son's asthma. The Gees live in Kentucky, which has passed laws allowing students to carry their asthma medication with them at school. Alexander's mom makes sure he has his inhaler with him when he goes to school and that he keeps it on hand at all times. In Delaware, where Jeremy lives, kids are allowed to carry their inhalers at school. The American Lung Association says that about 6.2 million American children suffer from asthma. Asthma is the chronic illness that causes students to miss the most days of school. There are many things that schools can do to help students control their asthma	['unhealthy habits']

Which of the following sentences is FALSE?	The new year has begun and some people may be looking to 2015 as the year they get a dog. A furry friend will bring a lot of fun and companionship to your family -- especially for urban residents who always feel lonely living in the fast-paced society. But looking after a pet does require some responsibility from the pet owner if you want your new friend to be healthy and happy in your family. The following is a checklist for people who are considering adopting an animal. Where to find a dog There are hundreds of pet shops in Shanghai, big and small, where you can find puppies at a cost ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands of yuan. The pet shop will tell you some basic facts about dogs of a specific breed. But don't forget to ask about the vaccination status if you are buying a puppy, which needs three injections with an interval of three to four weeks between shots. Another option is to ask your friends if they know anyone with a dog that has recently had puppies. This option is more reliable than buying a puppy from someone you don't know, especially the street peddlers who might carry animals with diseases. Another highly recommended option is to adopt one from an NGO dedicated to providing shelter and protecting stray animals. This is quite practical if you don't care about the dog's breed. Vaccination As a pet owner, there are some things you must do otherwise you may get into big trouble, and one of these is getting your dog vaccinated. Dogs need regular shots to fight against canine parvovirus , rabies and other diseases or viruses. To ensure the vaccines are not substandard, we strongly recommend you get your furry friend a shot from a qualified _ , which may cost a few hundred yuan each year. Another advantage of using the vet as opposed to getting your dog vaccinated yourself, is that the vet will examine its condition to see whether it is suitable to get a shot now and take immediate action if it has an allergic reaction to the vaccine. Because you are advised not to give your animal a bath for one week following its vaccination, you should clean your animal one or two days before the shot if you don't want your dog to get too dirty. Parasite protection As a pet owner, you need to be prepared to get rid of fleas , heartworm , roundworm , intestinal worms and other parasites from your dog. Dogs need regular flea and tick control and parasite protection, even if it does not show symptoms of being affected by the parasite. An adult dog needs to be fed with a tablet every six months to make sure it does not have any parasite. You also need to take measures every three months to help expel fleas and ticks from your animal. You need to learn the signs of a flea bite: they may immediately cause a dog to feel extremely itchy. Within 30 minutes of a bite, they may develop a red bump. Secondary infections caused by scratching are also common. Dog training No dog is born with good manners. Pooping on the carpet, leaping enthusiastically onto guests, pulling so hard that it practically yanks your arm out of the socket when on walks -- that's all perfectly acceptable in the canine world. It's up to you to teach your dog to behave the way humans want it to. Despite the adage(;) about old dogs and new tricks, there are no age limits to teaching dogs. And whether you've got a brand-new puppy or an older dog, the first step is the same: learn how to be a good teacher. Every dog is different and will respond better to a slightly different training style, but these general guidelines apply: stay consistent and patient, and reward your dog for getting it right.	['As a pet owner, it is unnecessary for you to be prepared to get rid of fleas.']
According to the text, which of the following statements is true?	Research shows that humans switch from selfish to unselfish behavior when they are watched. Do you? A picture of a set of eyes on a computer screen can cause a change in the way people act. Even images of eyes on a charity donation, collection box encourage people to be unselfish, because people put more money in a collection box that has a picture of eyes on it than they do when a flower symbol is on the box. Manfred Milinski from the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Germany and Bettina Rockenbach of the University of Berlin, the authors of a new study, found that people act better when they are being watched because they feel they will be rewarded for good behavior. Their report also referred to other research showing that this response of behaving well when watched is somehow _ into humans and people respond this way unconsciously, or without realizing it. It is not just humans that act unselfishly when they are being watched. A fish called the grooming fish cleans other fish. When other fish are around, it is gentler. When no other fish are around, however, the grooming fish bites chunks from the fish it is supposed to be cleaning. The researchers suggest that the best way to get people to behave in the correct way is to make them feel watched. This could be the reason for the success of a famous American army poster. On it was a picture of an elderly man staring fiercely and pointing, it appeared, to the person who was looking at the poster. Under the picture was the caption 'I Want You' It encouraged hundreds of thousands of young American men to join the army during the Second World War to fight the Germans and Japanese.

Why didn't the young man's mother and sisters answer him?	"A young man once went to town and bought himself a pair of trousers. When he got home, he went to his room and put them on. He found that they were about two inches too long. He went into the kitchen, and his mother and two sisters were doing some washing there. He said to them, ""The new trousers are too long. They need cutting by two inches. Would one of you mind doing this for me?"" His mother and sisters were busy and none of them said anything. But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went to her son's room silently and cut the trousers by two inches. She came back without saying anything to her daughters. After supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She went to his room and cut the trousers by two inches without saying anything to anyone. The younger sister went to the cinema. But when she came back, she also remembered her brother's trousers. So she went to his room and cut them by two inches, too."	['Because they were busy at that time.']
What do we learn from the passage about Comic Relief?	"If you watch British television on Friday March 15, you might be surprised to see celebrities wearing funny red noses and joking around. But don't worry, they're not mad, it's all part of a biennial fund-raising event called Red Nose Day. Organized by the charity Comic Relief, founded in 1985 by two British comedians, the aim of the event is to raise money to fight poverty and injustice in the UK and Africa. Celebrities and public figures support the event by making appearances on comic TV shows broadcast by the BBC. This year, for example, UK Prime Minister David Cameron appeared in a music video by One Direction, which the band produced for the event. But Britons don't just raise money for charitable causes on one day a year, they do it all year round. One way of doing so is by shopping in charity shops. These small, inconspicuous shops sell clothes, books and household goods just like any other shop. But there's one big difference--it's all secondhand. There are nearly 10,000 charity shops in the UK, according to the Charity Retail Association. Their business model is simple: Anybody who has things they don't want anymore can donate them to a charity shop, where they are checked for damage, cleaned and priced. Most items go back on sale at a small part of their original price and the money that is made by selling them is used for a charitable cause. The idea of buying used clothes may sound off-putting, but for shoppers who have less spending money, such as the elderly or those in low-paying jobs, it has been a welcome option for years. Now, ""thrifting""--shopping at charity shops-- is also becoming popular with young people looking for alternative fashion. ""I love shopping at thrift stores. You can find very unique clothes for a very cheap price. It doesn't bother me that other people may have worn them, I simply wash them before I wear them,"" said Anne Marie, a 19-year-old Internet user from the US, in a comment on a Yahoo forum. So next time you spot a charity shop, why not go inside? Who knows, you might find a lovely dress for just a few pounds. Even better, you can enjoy wearing it in the knowledge that your money helped a good cause."	['It organizes the Red Nose Day fund-raising event.']
What time of the year do the people in the passage pick strawberries?	It is a beautiful day in June. The sun is hot. It's time to harvest strawberries ,and the strawberry fields are full of people. These people are picking strawberry. They are not farmers, and they are picking fruit for fun. They can buy strawberries in a supermarket but it is cheaper to pick their own fruit. Strawberries from the farm are also flesher . Most people also like to pick their own fruit because it is a pleasant way to spend the afternoon. One little boy is walking between the rows of plants. He is picking the strawberries and eating them as fast as he can. Two young women in pretty dress and high-heeled shoes are getting out of their car. Now they are taking off their shoes. These women are taking a break from their work. They want to pick fruit and enjoy the sunshine.	['Early summer.']
